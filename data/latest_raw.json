This collision zone is a significant cause of seismic activity in the region. The Himalayas, one of the youngest mountain ranges in the world, are a direct result of this tectonic activity. The northeastern states, the Himalayan region, and parts of the western and southern regions of India are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. ### Notable Earthquakes 1. **2001 Gujarat Earthquake**: A devastating earthquake of magnitude 7.7 hit Gujarat on January 26, 2001, causing extensive damage and loss of life. 2. **2015 Nepal Earthquake**: Although centered in Nepal, this earthquake affected parts of India, especially the northern states, causing significant structural damage and casualties. 3. **2016 Imphal Earthquake**: A 6.7 magnitude earthquake struck Manipur’s capital, Imphal, causing damage to infrastructure and buildings. ### Impacts - **Human Lives**: Earthquakes result in the loss of lives, with thousands affected directly or indirectly. - **Infrastructure**: The destruction of buildings, roads, and bridges leads to economic losses and disrupts daily life. - **Economic Loss**: The financial burden of reconstruction and relief efforts is immense. ### Mitigation Measures - **Seismic Building Codes**: The Indian government has established guidelines for constructing earthquake-resistant buildings. - **Early Warning Systems**: Efforts are ongoing to develop and implement early warning systems to provide timely alerts. - **Public Awareness and Education**: Programs to educate the public on how to respond during an earthquake are crucial. ## Droughts in India ### Causes and Geography Droughts in India are primarily caused by insufficient rainfall, often linked to the failure of the monsoon. The country’s reliance on the monsoon for agriculture makes it particularly vulnerable to droughts. Regions such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and parts of Karnataka are frequently affected. ### Notable Droughts 1. **1965-66 Drought**: A severe drought affected large parts of India, leading to food shortages and economic challenges. 2. **2002-03 Drought**: This drought impacted agriculture, leading to a decline in crop production and affecting the livelihoods of millions. ### Impacts - **Agriculture**: Reduced rainfall affects crop yields, leading to food shortages and increased prices. - **Water Scarcity**: Droughts exacerbate water scarcity issues, affecting drinking water supplies and irrigation. - **Economic Strain**: The agricultural sector’s struggles during droughts have a ripple effect on the economy. ### Mitigation Measures - **Irrigation Projects**: The government has initiated several irrigation projects to ensure water availability during dry periods. - **Rainwater Harvesting**: Promoting rainwater harvesting can help mitigate the effects of drought. - **Drought-Resistant Crops**: Research and development of drought-resistant crop varieties are crucial for ensuring food security. ## Floods in India ### Causes and Geography Floods in India are often caused by excessive rainfall, river overflow, and poor drainage systems. The monsoon season, spanning from June to September, brings heavy rains that can lead to flooding. Major river systems, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and their tributaries, are prone to overflowing, particularly in northern and eastern India. ### Notable Floods 1. **2013 Uttarakhand Floods**: Caused by unprecedented rainfall, these floods resulted in significant loss of life and property, particularly in the pilgrimage town of Kedarnath. 2. **2018 Kerala Floods**: Torrential rains led to widespread flooding in Kerala, displacing thousands and causing extensive damage. ### Impacts - **Loss of Life and Property**: Floods cause casualties and destroy homes, businesses, and infrastructure. - **Public Health**: Stagnant water and poor sanitation during floods can lead to waterborne diseases. - **Economic Losses**: The cost of relief and reconstruction after floods is a significant economic burden. ### Mitigation Measures - **Flood Forecasting**: The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) provides forecasts and warnings to help prepare for potential floods. - **Embankments and Dams**: Constructing embankments and dams can help control river flow and reduce flood risks. - **Disaster Management Plans**: Implementing comprehensive disaster management plans at the local and national levels is essential for effective response and recovery. ## Cyclones in India ### Causes and Geography India’s long coastline, spanning over 7,500 kilometers, makes it vulnerable to cyclones, particularly along the eastern coast in the Bay of Bengal. Cyclones form due to low-pressure systems over warm ocean waters and can bring strong winds, heavy rains, and storm surges. ### Notable Cyclones 1. **1999 Odisha Cyclone**: One of the most powerful cyclones to hit India, it caused massive destruction and loss of life. 2. **Cyclone Fani (2019)**: This severe cyclone affected Odisha and West Bengal, causing widespread damage. ### Impacts - **Human Casualties**: Cyclones can lead to significant loss of life, especially in coastal areas. - **Infrastructure Damage**: High winds and storm surges can destroy buildings, roads, and power lines. - **Agricultural Losses**: Cyclones often devastate crops, leading to food shortages and economic loss. ### Mitigation Measures - **Cyclone Warning Systems**: The IMD issues cyclone warnings to help people evacuate and prepare. - **Coastal Defenses**: Building seawalls and storm surge barriers can help protect coastal areas. - **Evacuation Plans**: Developing and implementing efficient evacuation plans is crucial for saving lives. ## Tsunamis in India ### Causes and Geography Tsunamis are large ocean waves generated by underwater seismic activity, such as earthquakes. India’s eastern coastline and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are particularly vulnerable to tsunamis due to their proximity to tectonic plate boundaries. ### Notable Tsunamis 1. **2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami**: Triggered by a massive undersea earthquake, this tsunami devastated the coastal regions of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. ### Impacts - **Loss of Life**: Tsunamis can cause widespread fatalities, especially in coastal areas. - **Infrastructure Damage**: The massive waves can destroy buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. - **Environmental Impact**: Tsunamis can lead to long-term changes in coastal landscapes and ecosystems. ### Mitigation Measures - **Tsunami Warning Systems**: India has established a tsunami warning system to provide early alerts. - **Public Education**: Raising awareness about the risks and safety measures associated with tsunamis is vital. - **Coastal Zone Management**: Implementing policies to manage coastal zones and prevent construction in high-risk areas can reduce the impact of tsunamis. ## Tables and Data ### Table 1: Major Earthquakes in India | Year | Location | Magnitude | Deaths | Description | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 2001 | Gujarat | 7.7 | 20,000+ | Massive destruction in Bhuj and surrounding areas | | 2015 | Nepal (Affected India) | 7.8 | 8,964 | Significant damage in northern India | | 2016 | Imphal, Manipur | 6.7 | 11 | Infrastructure damage in the capital city | * * * ### Table 2: Major Floods in India | Year | Location | Affected Area | Deaths | Description | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 2013 | Uttarakhand | Kedarnath, Surrounding areas | 5,700+ | Floods caused by cloudburst and glacial meltdown | | 2018 | Kerala | Entire state | 483 | Unprecedented rainfall leading to massive displacement | * * * ### Table 3: Major Cyclones in India | Year | Name | Location | Category | Deaths | Description | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 1999 | Odisha Cyclone | Odisha | 5 | 9,658 | One of the deadliest cyclones in Indian history | | 2019 | Fani | Odisha | 4 | 89 | Severe cyclonic storm causing widespread damage | * * * ## List of Points: Key Mitigation Measures 1. **Seismic Building Codes**: Ensure buildings are constructed to withstand earthquakes. 2. **Early Warning Systems**: Implement for earthquakes, cyclones, floods, and tsunamis. 3. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Educate the public on disaster preparedness and response. 4. **Disaster Management Plans**: Develop and regularly update plans for all types of disasters. 5. **Infrastructure Development**: Invest in resilient infrastructure that can withstand natural disasters. ## Conclusion India’s geographical diversity exposes it to a range of natural disasters, including earthquakes, droughts, floods, cyclones, and tsunamis.

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. India’s long-running class-based, economic insurgency—the Naxalite insurgency (or Community Party of India [CPI]-Maoist insurgency)—is a case study in which external secu\u0002rity partnerships will remain limited, if not mostly unwelcomed, in New Delhi. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of do\u0002mestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Washington would be ill-served by an In\u0002dian backlash to such unwelcomed assertiveness. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime secu\u0002rity activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counter\u0002terrorism intelligence-sharing and operations. The United States instead should focus on not only its offers of major near-term bilateral military assistance for security cooperation but also, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns in New Delhi and Washington. 2 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Introduction This paper frames the contours of the recent and ongoing expansion in U.S.-India security ties. Then it briefly sketches the trajectory of the Naxalite insurgency through its first two phases and then focuses on the factors that made its third phase—from 2004 to the present—such a serious security challenge. The paper highlights the unique domestic factors that allowed the Naxalite rebellion’s rise to the status of India’s most significant internal security challenge from 2007 to 2010. It also identifies those domestic factors that enabled effective counterinsurgency actions beginning in 2011 and effective containment of the threat by 2014. After indicating the kinds of bilateral security assistance offered by the United States to India in recent years, the paper indicates the limited appeal of outside assistance to India in the domestic counterinsur\u0002gency arena and assesses why India’s self-selected counterinsurgency partnership limitations remain firmly in place. It concludes with some lessons learned for U.S. policymakers in terms of the opportunities and limitations for working with India in matters of domestic insurgency, advising that these limitations make sense on many levels. It also asserts that India’s limitations should be respected in Washington and Honolulu to avoid backlash from New Delhi. Any such backlash might threaten far more important U.S.-India bilateral interests in which shared mari\u0002time and other strategic interests seem to increasingly diverge with those of China and in areas of mutual benefit from global counterterrorism cooperation. The analysis in this paper is based on 3 years of author research into the unique features of the Naxalite insurgency in India. The research includes field interviews conducted on three visits to India during 2014 and 2015, one of which featured time in Kolkata and West Bengal. Expanding U.S.-India Security Framework, with Limits Growing for more than a decade, bilateral defense and security cooperation between the United States and India began accelerating quickly in 2014 and continued into 2016. Much of this acceleration, although not all of it, owed to the tone and tenor of the Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, elected and seated in 2014. Modi’s government, which is Indian nationalist with a dynamic economic, diplomatic, and security agenda, followed a decade-long Indian National Congress (INC) government that had become sclerotic in its dealings with the United States and other global partners from 2009 to 2013. The INC government set the table for U.S.-India defense and security cooperation during the mid-2000s, demonstrating a broad\u0002based Indian commitment to improved bilateral relations with the United States after decades 3 India’s Naxalite Insurgency of limited transactions. But the nationalist government of Prime Minister Modi has been driv\u0002ing it forward vigorously. The ongoing acceleration in broad Indo-American relations has taken many forms, in\u0002cluding high diplomacy. Prime Minister Modi made visiting the United States a priority, travel\u0002ing to America within 4 months of his May 2014 accession to the position of prime minister. Modi then made President Barack Obama the first ever U.S. President bestowed the high honor as chief guest at India’s Republic Day Parade in January 2015. During this visit, Obama and Modi signed a historic Joint U.S.-India Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region.1 Modi made a third informal visit to the United States in September 2015, using this historically rapid return to enhance economic relations between the national private and public sectors.2 The United States has committed to a wide array of economic projects in India fea\u0002turing public-private innovation, deeper financial cooperation and inclusive digital networks, “smart city” development in selected Indian cities, and support for increasing economic con\u0002nectivity between India and the states of South and Southeast Asia.3 The acceleration of broad bilateral ties has been showcased by the steady increase in de\u0002fense and security cooperation between the two countries. In June 2016, on a historic fourth visit to the United States and in conjunction with a third bilateral summit,4 Prime Minister Modi made a joint statement with President Obama declaring India and the United States to be “major defense partners,” expressing aspirations for expanded exchange of dual-use technolo\u0002gies and maritime security cooperation.5 The outcomes from this mid-2016 leadership engage\u0002ment underscored the fact that there have been noteworthy enhancements in military technol\u0002ogy interaction processes, basic military logistics and administrative arrangements, and joint military exercises. Since 2014, Prime Minister Modi has accelerated the process of bilateral security collabo\u0002ration on military modernization with emphasis on greater foreign investment in the Indian defense sector than ever before. Modi’s government covets American participation in India’s defense industry build-out to a degree not seen in the previous Indian government. The United States has worked to expand its 2012 bilateral defense initiative with India known as the U.S.- India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI). Pursuant to President Obama’s January 2015 visit for Republic Day, the United States has focused DTTI in pursuit of six major defense technology co-development and co-production efforts. There has been a particular focus on deeper cooperation in the areas of maritime security and maritime domain awareness.6 The United States and India also have done serious work on establishing basic frame\u0002work defense agreements that would enable closer cooperation and collaboration between their 4 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 militaries. Throughout 2015 and early 2016, both governments worked hard to develop mutu\u0002ally acceptable text for three critical military-to-military agreements. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), Basic Exchange and Coopera\u0002tion Agreement (BECA), and—perhaps the most consequential of the three—Logistics Supply Agreement.7 Aimed to move beyond the limited U.S.-India 2002 General Security of Military Information Agreement that underpinned modest U.S.-India defense interactions for more than a decade, the bilateral effort on these documents demonstrated important forward prog\u0002ress. Yet this progress did not beget culmination in formal agreements. Many observers hoped that these arrangements would be ready for signature during Secretary of Defense Ash Carter’s April 2016 visit to New Delhi for discussions with Minister of Defense Manohar Parrikar. But Indian sensitivities and complications in language and trust limited the April joint announce\u0002ment to one confirming that the defense leaders were agreed in principal—but had not yet signed—a modified Logistics Supply Agreement, known as a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement.8 It also signaled that both parties must continue to work on “other” agreements to enhance military cooperation and technology transfer. The CISMOA and BECA were not formally mentioned in the final statement of the meeting.9 In the area of joint military exercises, the U.S.-India partnership has been expanding. In 2015, India conducted more joint military exercises with the U.S. military than any other in the world.10 India and United States agreed in 2015 to extend a permanent invitation for Japanese naval forces to participate annually in Exercise Malabar. The United States, India, and Japan held Malabar 2016 in early June in the northern waters of the Philippine Sea, an area close to the East and South China seas, signaling to Beijing that the three nations hold a common interest in freedom of high seas navigation in all areas of the Pacific Ocean.11 But the acceleration and expansion of bilateral security interactions come with Indian limitations—ones that must temper U.S. policymaker aims, ambitions, and expectations. While agreeing to participate in the 2016 Malabar exercise with Japan and the United States in the northern Philippines, India firmly declined an offer by the commander of U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, to sign on for joint naval patrols with the United States, Japan, and Aus\u0002tralia in the South Pacific.12 India also has remained wary of any firm commitment to a bilateral defense CISMOA or BECA. Despite more than 2 years of bilateral effort, there remains no real progress on the joint development of jet engines or aircraft carrier technologies—both of which are target technologies for joint development.13 Each of these factors and more demonstrate that crafting a bilateral defense partnership between the United States and India will be a slow process 5 India’s Naxalite Insurgency that requires better understanding of differing critical equities. This process requires sustained, patient leadership in both countries in the face of certain frustrations moving forward. Scoping Bilateral Security Collaboration Limits: Indian Domestic Counterinsurgency and Counterterrorism The U.S. and Indian militaries have their own detailed and unique experiences in counter\u0002insurgency operations, so counterinsurgency seems a logical focal point for greater U.S.-India defense collaboration and partnership, and in many ways it is. But in other ways, it is not. U.S. policymakers and security analysts should understand the differences. When it comes to outside assistance and security partnership collaboration with India in its ongoing experiences with domestic insurgency, U.S. policymakers and military leaders must remain aware that India does not—and likely will not—treat U.S. military offers of direct assis\u0002tance with a warm welcome. India’s experiences with its long-running domestic Naxalite insur\u0002gency provide a powerful example about the limited scope for U.S. military engagement and the circumspect manner in which any U.S. security assistance must be approached with New Delhi. The lessons about context, tenor, and tone found in the example of the Naxalite insurgency over the past 10 years demonstrate that the United States is a better partner for India when remaining at distance, as New Delhi deals with its unique domestic insurgency challenges. India’s Approach to Domestic Insurgency Over the past 60 years, India has confronted three major domestic insurgencies.14 In Jam\u0002mu and Kashmir, disaffected Muslim groups and unsatisfied local populations have contested India’s so-called occupation of its territories on the southeastern side of the Line of Control. India’s northeast has undergone multiple, overlapping waves of tribal, socioethnic-based insur\u0002gent movements since the mid-1950s. These northeastern separatist insurgencies have ebbed and flowed as Indian military and political approaches to their grievances eliminated some and catalyzed others. India also has been confronted with economic class–based violence and armed confrontation in its eastern regions, violence referred to as a Naxalite or Maoist insurgency. Numerous Indian analysts, and some outsiders, argue that India has among the best re\u0002cords in the world when combating insurgencies.15 The claim is debatable on many levels. Yet it does accurately reflect that India has persistent experience with a variety of domestic insurgencies over a considerable period of time. Official Indian counterinsurgency doctrine formally espouses a population-centric strategy focused on winning “hearts and minds.”16 A more detailed examination of India’s record reveals that India often does take a political 6 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 approach in combination with a military one when facing domestic insurgencies. However, India’s political approaches often are less about hearts and minds and more often feature ex\u0002tended periods of national-level tolerance of state- and local-level politician and police leader\u0002ship manipulation of insurgent groups. Often this manipulation is in the pursuit of regional and local vote banks (or vote blocks). Frequently manipulation is followed by the co-option of rebellion elites in an effort to buy-out, or limit the insurgency once it festers to a level beyond the ability of the state and regional authorities to manage. Co-option approaches have taken the forms of turning insurgents through monetary compensation, creating new political space for a “turned” insurgent group, or abducting and torturing key insurgent leaders.17 Quite often these nonkinetic approaches have created their own problems with corrupt security forces, increased criminal activity, and a litany of human rights complaints and investigations.18 India’s employment of military forces in domestic counterinsurgency operations has fea\u0002tured a number of innovative practices, some successful and others counterproductive. When engaged fully, the Indian national response tends to feature a combination of state police forces, Central Armed Police Forces, special paramilitary units, and—in some cases such as Kashmir and India’s Northeast—the introduction of regular army units. India’s federal statutes mandate that the chief minister (or governor) of a state formally request national police (including Cen\u0002tral Armed Police Forces units), paramilitary, or national army support before such forces can be introduced into a counterinsurgency fight. In those cases when the army is introduced, it must be authorized by the prime minister and given authorities by the Indian parliament to operate under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which includes the authority for military forces to make arrests, search without warrants, and shoot to kill civilians when required.19 In\u0002dia’s martial counterinsurgency activities are normally “enemy centric” and have been assessed to regularly feature a strategy of attrition and raw coercion where overwhelming numbers of security forces attempt to suffocate the insurgency at the same time that political activities are conducted to co-opt its leadership.20 There are several important conclusions to be drawn about India’s historical approach to domestic counterinsurgency. First, India does pursue varied counterinsurgency approaches to its multiple domestic insurgencies, depending on the unique context of each. Some respons\u0002es—such as those in Jammu and Kashmir and Northeast India—have featured a permanent deployment of the Indian army. Other responses, such as those toward the respective phases of the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India, have been limited to national central armed police forces (mainly but not exclusively Central Reserve Police Forces [CRPF]) deployment into the unsettled states from the central government (see appendix B for detail on national special 7 India’s Naxalite Insurgency police units). Second, India’s political and military approaches toward domestic insurgency generally do not follow a classic hearts and minds approach. Instead, they normally feature enemy-centric and highly kinetic military operations combined with creative, and often con\u0002troversial, political co-option of selected insurgent groups and group leaders. Third, India’s federal democratic structure often drives domestic counterinsurgency responses that feature uncomfortable political tradeoffs at the local level, state level, and between the state and the national governments. The political mobilization aspect of domestic insurgent groups creates incentives for political parties to harness these groups for their own ends.21 Invariably, this political utility makes them hard to counter in a timely manner and then difficult to address in the face of growing corruption, illegal activities, and often human rights questions as they embed into the political and social space. In general, Indian domestic counterinsurgency has worked for the country out and its distinctive system of governance and its complex national ethnic makeup. India’s approaches have contained, but not eliminated, the three major insurgencies that it has faced since inde\u0002pendence. But for many Westerners, India’s domestic counterinsurgency “successes” can look exceptionally violent and uncomfortably incomplete.22 This divergence in perspectives is im\u0002portant. It indicates why India prefers strict autonomy in the conduct of its domestic counterin\u0002surgent operations, routinely brushing aside the limited offers of direct outside military support that it receives. It also demonstrates why outside partners, including the United States, should realize that if they push too aggressively in offering well-intentioned direct assistance in these areas, they could encounter significant resistance in New Delhi—possible to the point where security cooperation could be dampened in other more important areas of mutual interest. India’s deep past and recent experiences with the Naxalite insurgency demonstrate the wisdom of these conclusions. The Naxalite Insurgency—History and Context: Phases 1 and 2 The Naxalite insurgency started as a communist peasant revolt in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It later evolved into a combination of ethnic-, caste-, and class-based political violence across a number of the poorest provinces in India’s east.23 It became known as Naxalism, or the Naxalite movement, given its late 1950s origins as a Maoist movement struggling for in\u0002dependence in the small village of Naxalbari in the state of West Bengal, along the Indo-Nepal border (see map 1).24 The 1967 Naxalbari uprising against feudal landlords sowed the seeds for insurgency in India.25 8 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 The Naxalites were a group of far-left radical communists who promoted Maoist political sentiment and ideology to fight exploitation by landlords in India’s feudal postcolonial socio\u0002economic system. In this approach, the Naxalites broke from the tradition of Indian communist Map 1. States and Union Territories of India 9 India’s Naxalite Insurgency political participation in the electoral system supplemented by general worker strikes that had been the staple of Communist Party of India activity from the 1920s through the 1950s.26 Dur\u0002ing the 1940s and 1950s, the CPI had become aligned with Moscow in its international leanings, functioning in India mainly as a political party. Around the same time, communism in India split in a third direction, with the CPI-Marxist group taking a more radical approach to its po\u0002litical rhetoric but mainly pursuing its own independent parliamentary path.27 Naxalism is based upon an extremist belief that the Indian government is a semicolonial, feudalistic, and imperial entity that needs to be overthrown. Naxalism’s objective is to seize state power through a protracted armed struggle against big landlords and petty government of\u0002ficials. Naxalism takes up the cause of the marginalized sections of society. It often opposes the implementation of various developmental projects such as construction of roads, rails, schools, and hospitals in affected areas in order to demonstrate to the people the ineffectiveness of the state. When successful, the Naxalite movement has operated in a vacuum created by the absence or collapse of the administrative structure at the local, provincial, or state level.28 The Naxalite movement has evolved through three separate phases in India. The first phase ran from the late 1960s through 1973. The second phase occurred from the late 1970s through 1994. The third and most significant phase formally began in 2004, reaching a peak of violence from 2005 to 2011 and declining to a nadir in 2014. A short review of the first two phases of the Naxalite insurgency establishes its patterns and India’s preferred security framework for dealing with this domestic stability threat. A more detailed review of the third and most noteworthy phase of the Naxalite insurgency follows in a subsequent section. First Phase, 1967–1973 Inspired by Maoist revolutionary tactics and the Cultural Revolution in China, the Naxalite movement gained momentum and began in the late 1960s and 1970s. Initially the movement centered in the Indian states of West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh (map 1). It featured peasants seizing land by force and then taking up arms to protect themselves against police and landlord response.29 Soon these rural activities merged with politically disillusioned and ideologically driven university students from Kolkata and other urban areas in India’s Far East—with active cells stretching from the state of Bihar in the north to Adhra Pradesh in the south. By 1969 un\u0002der charismatic leader Charu Mazumdar, the Naxalites organized as the CPI–Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) and attempted more centralized and violent tactics.30 CPI-ML moved to organize peasants and seize political power through guerilla warfare while focusing on annihilation of its class enemies.31 In urban areas such as Kolkata (then known as Calcutta), Naxalite insurgents 10 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 targeted police and local constables, attacking police outposts and patrols with an aim to cap\u0002ture weapons.32 Despite some limited weapons assistance and rhetorical support from Mao’s Communist government in the 1960s, China never undertook a strong campaign of support for the Nax\u0002alites.33 The Naxalites remained fragmented and without much training or organization. This first wave of Naxalite violence peaked in 1971 when over 3,650 acts of class-based attacks were reported and more than 850 people were reported killed. But it quickly succumbed to its own weaknesses and a state counterinsurgency response that featured two waves of activity. From the summer of 1969 through the end of 1971, state-led counterinsurgency campaigns against the rural Naxalite cadres decimated much of those insurgency cadres. State police, as\u0002sisted by the CRPF, moved against poorly armed Naxalites with great effect. By 1971 these po\u0002lice forces were joined by army units deployed into West Bengal. It took the failure of local and state police to contain Naxalite insurgents for more than 2 years before the West Bengal deputy chief minister—himself a politician from the CPI-Maoist party—requested assistance from a central paramilitary force, the Eastern Frontier Rifles, to assist state security forces. Then in July and August of 1971 a more dangerous component of the Naxalite insurgency in West Ben\u0002gal’s Birbhum District was put down by a joint campaign led by the army known as Operation Steeplechase. Army involvement only came after the collapse of an Indian National Congress– led coalition government in West Bengal and the New Delhi declaration of “President’s Rule” throughout the region. This made the central government responsible for the fight against the Naxalites and enabled Prime Minister Indira Ghandi to divert elements of the army massing along the East Pakistan border for what would become the December 1971 Indo-Pakistani War that assisted local police in decisive counterinsurgency operations.34 The urban dimension of the first wave of the Naxalite insurgency remained violent throughout 1971 and festered into the next 2 years, even as the rural component succumbed to Operation Steeplechase. Interparty political violence in Kolkata among the INC, CPI-M, and CPI-ML led to a swirl of assassinations and attacks against security forces and political leaders across urban areas. The election of a new West Bengal chief minister from the INC in March 1972 turned the tide on the urban Naxals. The law and order platform of Chief Minister Sid\u0002dharth Shankar Ray played out in a much more muscular police role across Kolkata and its surroundings throughout mid-1972 and into mid-1973. Kolkata police apprehended Naxalite leader Charu Maumdar in July 1972, and he died in custody several weeks later. Naxalite lead\u0002ers across the city succumbed to increasing police and state paramilitary presence. By 1973 the main cadres of the Naxalites had been eliminated and were dead or behind bars.35 11 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In this first Naxalite insurgent phase, the national government followed a pattern that would be repeated in subsequent phases. It did not forcibly intervene in the beginning. In keep\u0002ing with the federalist framework of the constitution, the government in New Delhi left it to local and state officials in West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and other afflicted states to take their own security actions to stop the threat. In the late 1960s, these state and local responses were often inadequate and ineffective.36 The central government only engaged with security forces once it had a critical mass of army forces in the region for the 1971–1972 war with Pakistan over Bangladesh and when the President’s Rule special authorities were in place, which enabled the military the power to make preventative arrests, search premises without a warrant, and shoot to kill civilians. Once engaged, the slowly evolving national response became one featuring intense force and coercion, eradicating the violence without eliminating the insurgency’s socio\u0002economic preconditions. Second Phase, 1977–1994 India’s first wave of insurgent violence ended badly for this domestic left-wing extremist movement but did not eliminate the conditions inspiring the movement or all of those willing to hold to the Naxalite cause. The movement fractured into more than 40 separate small groups.37 Slowly—over the course of a decade—these groups began to remobilize and consolidate. Par\u0002ticularly in the southeastern Indian state of Adhra Pradesh, a new Naxalite organization called People’s War emerged. Its leader, Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, sought a more efficient structure to boost morale, recruitment, and funding. By 1978 Naxalite peasant revolts had spread to the Karimnagar District of Telangana and Adilabad District of Adhra Pradesh. The major grievance was unpaid wages. Second-wave Naxalite insurgents kidnapped landlords and forced them to confess to crimes, apologize to villagers, and repay forced bribes. By the early 1980s insurgents had established a stronghold and sanctuary in the interlinked North Telangana village and Dan\u0002dakaranya forests areas along the Adhra Pradesh and Orissa border.38 In 1985 Naxalite insurgents began ambushing police. After they killed a police sub-inspec\u0002tor in Warangal, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh responded by creating a special task force called the Greyhounds to establish control in the seven worst affected districts. An elite anti-Naxalite commando unit that still exists today, the Greyhounds were drawn from within the Andhra Pradesh police forces and given special treatment. A 2,000-strong force in 2015, the Grey\u0002hounds were given preferred payment and training—better than federal or state paramilitary forces. They were also highly supported by the entire state police force. The Greyhounds played a minimal role in combatting the Naxalites during the second phase of the Maoist insurgency.39 12 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In 1987 the Naxalite political party (People’s War) and other Maoist groups in Andhra Pradesh were barred from elections after kidnapped government officials were exchanged for Naxalite prisoners. The ban was briefly lifted in 1991. In December of that year, however, insur\u0002gent attacks increased. Affected states responded by establishing special laws that enabled police to focus on capture, detention, and extra-normal means of violence against Naxalite cadres— fighters and presumed supporters.40 Adhra Pradesh and Orissa invited additional central para\u0002military forces in Telangana to augment state and federal government security forces already there. Besides brute force, the state set up rival mass organizations to attract youth away from the Naxalites, started rehabilitation programs, and established new informant networks.41 The new counterinsurgency strategy reduced violent incidents, and nearly 9,000 Naxalites surrendered. Consequently in 1994 the ban on ostensibly moderate Naxalite political parties was lifted.42 The second wave of the Naxalite insurgency had been stopped. However, and as at the end of the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency, the socioeconomic conditions underpin\u0002ning Naxalism remained largely unchanged in many regions of eastern India. Third Phase, 2004–2015 From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s the Naxalite insurgency remained largely out of the public eye, but the movement had not gone away. Taking advantage of rising local support for violent response to economic conditions, fragmented Naxalite groups created a united front: the People’s War, Party Unity, and the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) combined to form the People’s War Group (PWG). Naxalism manifested itself in episodic spurts of violence by the PWG, which had its most pronounced presence in Adhra Pradesh. From 1999–2002, local level violence increased. The PWG accelerated attacks on state government locations in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Chhattisgarh. By 2000 an estimated 3,000 armed Naxalite rebels were re\u0002portedly active in India’s east.43 During this time, Indian government agencies took actions that accelerated grievances among the poor and displaced with sympathies for left-wing violence. First, economic growth and development led to local and state government appropriation of land for infrastructure and resource development, displacing many underprivileged people who had no political voice. Second, governments responded to Naxalite violence with acute violence, reportedly includ\u0002ing the extra-judicial murder and torture of suspected rebels and rebel families.44 The MCC intensified its campaign of violence against Indian security forces and government agencies in 2002–2003 after its leader was killed by police.45 13 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In 2004, the PWG was superseded by the CPI-M.46 From this 2004 merger of the two larg\u0002est Naxalite factions—the PWG and MCC—into the CPI-M, Maoist ideology was fused with a cadre of armed groups for the first time.47 A third and more lethal wave of violence—more sophisticated and more destructive—rapidly spread throughout eastern India. Naxalite leaders expanded control over natural resource rich areas (for example, coal, gas, precious minerals, and timber). They also collected taxes and extortion money to fund weapons production, including the production of crude but effective improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Estimates from 2004 to 2011 suggest the Naxalites extracted at least $18.4 million annually from government offices, contractors, businessmen, and industrialists.They embarked upon more choreographed terror campaigns including the murder of local politicians, overwhelming attacks on local police sta\u0002tions, impressment of child soldiers, and a general campaign to scare away outside investors. By the second half of 2005, Naxalites demonstrated a lethality and reach far beyond the capacity of other domestic terrorist and insurgent groups. They destroyed buildings, captured weapons, and killed several local policemen in an attack on a village in Uttar Pradesh. They also attacked the Jehanabad Prison in Bihar, killing two, freeing more than 300 inmates, and abduct\u0002ing about 30 inmates who were members of an anti-Naxalite group. Total deaths from Naxalite\u0002attributed insurgency and terrorism grew to more than 800 in the impacted east and north\u0002eastern regions.48 In 2006 and 2007, this trend expanded. In 2006, Naxalite groups launched several high-profile attacks against civilians and security forces, expanding the rural territory under Maoist control and under threat of extreme violence. In one event, an attack by some 800 armed Naxalites in Chhattisgarh killed 25, injured 80 more, and saw some 250 people declared missing.49 In 2006, the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh grew concerned about the mounting threat posed by Naxalite groups to internal stability and democratic traditions across the east and southeast of India. The Naxalite menace had grown such that 18 of India’s federal states and 194 of its total districts were effected by Naxalite violence. For the first time Prime Minister Singh called the Naxalite/Maoist insurgency and associated terrorism “the sin\u0002gle biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”50 In 2007 Naxalite and Maoist violence reached an apex where it would remain for the next 4 years through 2010 (see map 2). Over 971 Naxalite attacks were recorded in the first seven months of 2007. That number would grow to over 1,500 attacks by the end of the year (see table51). Left-wing extremists began target\u0002ing elected officials including a member of the Indian parliament from Jharkhand state and the son of a former chief minister (or governor) of Andhra Pradesh.52 By 2010 the Naxalites were active in nine Indian states and reported to have a strong foot\u0002hold in parts of seven: West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, 14 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 and Maharashtra. This region happened to sit atop tremendous iron ore, coal, and aluminum deposits as well as irrigation and hydroelectric power potential. Across these states there were more than 2,200 incidents of Naxalite violence and almost 1,200 killed in 2010 alone (table).53 Map 2. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2007 15 India’s Naxalite Insurgency The threat to Indian national interests became obvious to the federal government and more co\u0002ordinated actions followed. From 2005 through 2010, Naxalite violence and the insufficient state-led, federally sup\u0002ported efforts to counter it cost India an average of more than 700 deaths per year. Most of these individuals were classified as civilian (see appendix A). Recruited from the disaffected rural poor, Naxalite cadres grew by 2010 to an estimated 20,000 armed fighters and an additional 50,000 supporters.54 In 2010, as he had first done in 2006, Prime Minister Singh trumpeted the risks of Naxalite violence to the stability and the ever important economic growth for the country. In May of that year, Prime Minister Singh referred to Naxalism as the “biggest internal security challenge” India has ever faced.55 The national government was understandably frustrated. From January to June 2009, India witnessed over 1,100 Naxalite-generated incidents of violence. These would double by the end of 2009 (table). Major violence occurred during national elections held from April to May 2009 as Naxalites called for an election boycott, attacked polling places, set off land mines, and even took control of a region of West Bengal known as Lalgarh. Paramilitary and police response operations against Naxalite locations were largely unsuccessful.56 Naxalite atrocities gained national notoriety. But simultaneously, accusations of systematic local police brutality and local and federal police human rights abuses against innocent civilians grew more vocal throughout the affected zones.57 In 2010 Naxalite violence inflicted 9 separate states of India and over 200 individual districts.58 Year 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 All Incidents 1,088 1,091 1,136 1,415 1,760 2,212 2,258 1,591 1,565 1,509 1,608 1,533 Attacks on Police 118 155 143 135 131 230 250 192 N/A 210 194 N/A Total Deaths 251 280 376 321 532 1,138 907 648 650 685 846 636 N/A = specific data not available Sources: “Left Wing Extremist (LWE) Data,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of Naxal Violence During 2008 to 2012,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of LWE Violence During 2011 to 2016 (up to 31.03.2016),” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; Government of India Ministry of Home Affairs, “Annual Reports,” available at. Table. Major Incidents During Naxalite Insurgency, Third Phase 16 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In March 2010, after months of prevarication and confusion, the national government launched Operation Green Hunt. The initiative added an additional estimated 20,000 federal paramilitary troops, mainly from the CRPF battalions, to existing state, local, and already pres\u0002ent Ministry of Home Affairs forces from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Border Security Forc\u0002es, and Shashastra Seema Bal.59 (See appendix B for detail on MHA special police units.) The operation sent federal, state, and local police and paramilitary forces into former no-go zones deep in the forests of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra states to rid them of militants, but these operations struggled. In April 2010, Naxalite insurgents ambushed 80 troops of the Indian Cen\u0002tral Police Security Forces (CPSF) in Chhattisgarh, killing an estimated 75 in the worst attack on Indian security forces since the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency began.60 In February 2011 Naxalites kidnapped two Indian government officials, demanding a halt to Green Hunt. The government agreed. The Naxalites also demanded the release of seven top imprisoned lead\u0002ers in exchange for the two officials. After a May 2011 Naxalite attack, 10 bodies of policemen were found dismembered in dense forest.61 Despite the major setbacks of 2010–2011, Indian federal and state authorities made some headway against a Naxalite insurgency now generating international headlines.62 Better coordi\u0002nated joint federal-state anti-Naxalite security operations killed a prominent Naxalite military leader, Koteswara Rao, in a November 2011 operation. In 2012 government paramilitary and police operations in West Bengal and Chhattisgarh began to produce results, with more than 1,800 Naxalite insurgents reported arrested and another 440 surrendered during the year.63 In late 2012 several Naxalite regional military leaders were captured and killed in those provinces. Acts of extreme violence continued during 2012 and 2013, but the expanse of the insur\u0002gency began to abate. Insurgency-related fatalities declined in 2012 and remained below 400 in 2013 (table). West Bengal reported sharp declines in Naxalite presence and activities dur\u0002ing 2013, although some observers declared that the decline in those states was offset by a corresponding increase of Naxalite violence in neighboring states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Orissa (appendix A). The Naxalites began the practice of including booby-trapping the bodies of dead Indian soldiers with IEDs in their stomachs. They killed national Congressman, and an\u0002ti-Naxalite militia Salwa Judum founder, Mahendra Karma in an attack on his convoy while he was campaigning for election in rural Chhattisgarh communities. Prime Minister Singh called for a two-pronged approach to dismantle the Naxalite network: sustaining joint and proactive military operations with greater economic development and responsible governance programs in the areas with strongest Maoist support. The CRPF successfully launched a 5-day interstate offensive in late December 2013 to dismantle core Maoist groups.64 It shut down a gun manu- 17 India’s Naxalite Insurgency facturing factory and recovered numerous weapons and explosives. Remote triggering devices were also found, indicating that the insurgency was using more advanced weaponry. By 2014 fatalities from Naxalite violence dropped below 300 for the first time in more than a decade (table). Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh remained most affected by the violence, and some Naxalite groups conducted operations and expanded into southern regions of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka states. But a review of the map in 2013 of Naxalite-impacted areas revealed a significant drop in the overall number of affected districts since 2007—from 165 to 120 overall—and an even more significant drop in districts categorized as experiencing severe or moderate amounts of violence from Naxalite activities over the same period—from 69 dis\u0002tricts in 2007 to just 28 in 2013 (see map 3). Eighty percent of Naxalite violence now afflicted only three states of India, down from the nine states impacted by serious Naxalite violence in 2010. On balance the tide had turned. By the end of 2014 the Naxalite insurgency was down if not out.65 In 2015, Indian joint security and economic efforts to counter the remaining Naxalite threat focused on 30 key districts in these 3 most impacted states, enabling more concentrated efforts matching gradually applied paramilitary enforcement with legal reforms and develop\u0002ment activities.66 As in the first two waves of Naxalite insurgency, the Indian federal-state government dis\u0002connect hampered its counterinsurgency efforts throughout the 2000s. Under the Indian con\u0002stitution, states bear the responsibility for enforcing law and order. When required, however, the federal government can send police and—under more limited conditions—military troops. In the case of federal police, assistance can come only upon request from the state government. In the case of military troops, assistance can come in the event of a state of emergency declara\u0002tion—as during the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency. Throughout the period from 2000 to 2010, the federal and state home (interior) ministries supervised multiple police and intelligence agencies without much unity of effort or command. An operation against Naxalite groups in the state of Bihar early in the 2000s faltered. Federal paramilitary border security forces in seven districts helped the local police, and millions of ru\u0002pees were promised in economic development opportunities. But the economic promises were broken, and poorly coordinated security operations only further alienated Naxalite moderates, derailing hoped for results by early 2002. In advance of 2004 elections in Chhattisgarh, the fed\u0002eral government sent 180 companies of paramilitary forces armed with helicopters and other advanced equipment. The Naxalites disappeared. Once the elections were over, federal troops and equipment departed and the Naxalites returned. 18 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 From the 2004 merger of Naxalite groups, the Indian government, particularly at the federal level, applied both carrots and sticks, incentivizing insurgents to pick constitutional remedies and brutally punishing those who refused. But the splits between state and federal authorities limited effectiveness. In part, state and local governments saw themselves in a co\u0002nundrum; they wanted an end to the organized Naxalite violence targeting them, their infra\u0002Map 3. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2013 19 India’s Naxalite Insurgency structure, and their legal enforcement structure. However, they did not want to alienate the vote banks across their states who sympathized with the Naxalite view of economic injustice but did not actively participate in violence. In one notable but far from unique instance, the chief minister (or governor) of the Naxalite-wracked state of Jharkhand won election in 2009 with strong insurgent sympathizer and insurgent vote bank support.67 State-level leaders de\u0002sired greater economic support from the central government, not overwhelming force, as the primary means to redress deeply held communist sympathies in their vote constituencies. Na\u0002tional political leaders within the INC empathized with these state-level concerns, offering some economic support and some additional policing support—but too little of either to make significant headway prior to 2010–2011. The politics of left-wing issues and voter concerns made effective coordination of counterinsurgency versus the Naxalites difficult. It took the extensive violence and loss of life between 2007 and 2010 to demonstrate the failure of an ill-coordinated approach. In 2009 the central government signaled that it wanted to provide 80,000 paramilitary and federal police to help in the fight, but these were too slowly fed into the region without strong local coordination. From the desperation of the peak year of Naxalite (CPI-Maoist) violence in 2010, and then–Prime Minister Singh’s second declaration that Maoist violence was India’s most grave internal security threat, a combination of state\u0002level requests and federal-level policy improvements paved the way for late-arriving successes against the Naxalites.68 The path to success was also paved by corresponding Naxalite failures. Beginning in 2010, the Indian federal government finally undertook several successful ini\u0002tiatives that slowly but steadily spanned the coordination gap between federal and state security forces and linked with improved local economic development aid.69 First, the government took steps to increase the costs to Maoist insurgent group operations—both financial and physical. Second, the central government deployed an additional 66 federal paramilitary security battal\u0002ions, CPSF and others, into the field where the insurgency had been winning against small and poorly trained local police. As noted above, these came slowly and in tranches between 2010 and 2014 but reached an impressive number of more than 200,000 by early 2014.70 India’s mili\u0002tary and its special operations forces (SOF) have not participated directly in the third phase of Naxalite counterinsurgency operations. Instead, SOF units have provided indirect assistance— offering specialized training to Indian Central Armed Police Forces (see appendix B) preparing to deploy to the anti-Maoist counterinsurgency fight.71 Third, the federal government built 444 new police stations in affected areas and regenerated the policing capability in them.72 Fourth, the government established a civil development program in the worst affected areas. Finally, government security forces worked more effectively in a combined action environment where 20 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 economic development and human rights were established in the communities most vulnerable to Naxalite recruiting and propaganda.73 These five national factors interacted with several organizational failures by the Naxalites themselves. First, the Maoists failed to generate a message of systematic economic exploitation to the degree necessary for serious attention in Indian urban areas, where the gulf between rich and poor was great and growing every year. Second, despite their highly publicized violence, the Naxalites never won the “mindspace” in India; the Maoist ideology of class conflict gener\u0002ated limited appeal outside of primitive and tribal areas in India, never resonating in urban ar\u0002eas other than with a marginalized group of activist university students.74 Indian youth moved onto other causes and other areas of activism in the wider Indian economy.75 Third, Naxalites proved to be their own worst enemies. They often splintered into criminal syndicates deal\u0002ing narcotics and running both extortion and kidnapping rackets. This profiteering, evident from as early as 2009–2010, revealed that Naxalism was less about communist ideology or well-coordinated violent insurgent activity and much more about local and regional organized criminal activity, which exploits rather than benefits the lower class (and lower caste) Indian Hindus who live there.76 In self-reflective statements, ministry-level officials in the Indian federal government ac\u0002knowledged that most Naxalite gains before 2010 had come too often because local govern\u0002ments and security officials incorrectly assessed and mishandled the problems of the disgrun\u0002tled Indian minority groups in rural areas. At the same time the central government remained tepid in its involvement—unable to induce state governments to request more assertive federal security assistance and caught in a political conundrum where some of the state government leadership was both courting Naxalite sympathizer votes while simultaneously fighting Naxalite militant cadres. Once the federal government got serious and increased paramilitary security presence with a wider number of local economic development programs, the Naxalites began to wane.77 Attention to a holistic approach by the Indian central government caused the worst of the Naxalite insurgency to recede in a visible manner.78 In 2016 the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India remains a security factor, but one far from the menace publicly announced by then–Prime Minister Singh in 2006 and again in 2010.79 Instead it is now much more of a nuisance, largely a constellation of organized criminal enter\u0002prises with a loose affiliation to a Maoist credo than an ideological insurgency. The socioeco\u0002nomic factors that inspire Naxalite groups remain in place, and this insurgency could again evolve into a more serious threat to local security agents in India. In the poor eastern districts of India, the possibility of a fourth wave of Naxalite insurgency cannot be dismissed if the rich 21 India’s Naxalite Insurgency continue to get richer without the benefits of economic growth filtering down to the people who really need it.80 India’s long slog toward corralling the third phase of its Naxalite insurgency again demon\u0002strated the challenges and strengths of its counterinsurgency framework. State and local govern\u0002ment police forces must fail obviously and admit to their failures before major federal assistance can come forward. Left-wing (or communist) inspired violence mixes awkwardly with Indian electoral politics in many eastern states of the country. Communist political party voters often sympathize with Naxalite grievances but not their violent means. State and local officials thus have incentives to take uncertain and indecisive action with their police and security forces. Too often, they can tolerate incompetence and even human rights abuses by local-level counterin\u0002surgency police and militias, exacerbating wider grievances. They appeal for national economic help while avoiding national security help out of a fear that too much outside intervention might harm their local political interests. Federal-level forces, when these do arrive, come with their own issues. They can lack local knowledge and fail to be sensitive to popular culture and traditions. This leaves them vulnerable to insurgent ambush and to charges of torture or human rights abuses from an uncertain or frightened local population. U.S. Security Engagement with Indian Ministry of Home Affairs U.S. engagement with India in the areas of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency has developed over a 16-year period from January 2000. This engagement has advanced along three parallel lines of interaction. One line has been through bilateral dialogue and exercises between U.S. and Indian SOF, which have focused on counterterrorism training events and conversa\u0002tions. A second line has been through collaboration between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Indian Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This collaboration has focused on criminal investigative techniques; port, rail, and maritime security training and best practices; and a general growth in liaison and information exchange between respective special police and border security agencies. A third line of interaction has evolved in more general bilateral military-to-military exchanges between the national armies, navies, air forces, and coast guards. Advancements in each of these areas have been noteworthy but not comprehensive. For all the noteworthy advances, limitations have remained, especially when it comes to the matter of outside assistance for Indian units and organizations conducting domestic counterinsurgency. The history of special operations training and exercising is most noteworthy. Bilateral U.S.- Indian SOF have undertaken joint exercises that work on interoperability in counterterror\u0002ism and counterinsurgency operation skills and drills. Small-scale counterterrorism training 22 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 exercises have been conducted on a recurring basis since 2002, including exercises in India’s northeast territories where longstanding domestic insurgencies continue.81 Under the broad definition of U.S.-India maritime security cooperation, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) SOF also have been training Indian military special forces officers in counterterrorism, learning from Indian counterterrorism experiences at the same time. In the main, these exercises have focused upon special techniques and capabilities for SOF activities in counterterrorism opera\u0002tions (see appendix C). Despite a decade of offers by U.S. senior commanders and defense officials, Indian leaders declined to have U.S. SOF engage with or provide direct assistance to the MHA paramilitary and police forces optimized for domestic counterterrorism or counterinsurgency operations.82 But in October 2015, India, for the first time, welcomed U.S. SOF to a joint training exercise with its MHA counterterrorism unit, the National Security Guards (NSG).83 This was a meaningful step forward and, as most observers believe, became possible only after the change in perspective ac\u0002companying the government of Prime Minister Modi. Yet the limit of U.S. SOF interaction with that of only the NSG—the single special police unit focused on counterterrorism rather than counterinsurgency operations—is telling. After more than a decade of U.S. offers, the Indian government still remains uncomfortable about direct bilateral counterinsurgency training with its large array of MHA domestic counterinsurgency forces. Washington and New Delhi first established the U.S.-India Counterterrorism Joint Work\u0002ing Group (JWG) in January 2000. Among more than a dozen major steps, the United States and India initiated antiterrorism training programs for Indian law enforcement officials and began a dialogue on cooperation in homeland and internal security.84 First, these programs involved lim\u0002ited military-to-military counterterrorism engagements. Then, after the November 2008 Mum\u0002bai terrorist attack, a more formal set of interactions between DHS and MHA counterterrorism and law enforcement officials began to take shape. Notably, however, neither of these lines of engagement have witnessed the MHA welcoming direct U.S. military or special police assistance for its special police or border police engaged in combating the Naxalite insurgency. In September 2005, USPACOM conducted a counterterrorism tabletop exercise that brought together Indian and American military, diplomatic, law enforcement, and humanitari\u0002an assistance leaders. A U.S. National Guard unit co-trained with Indian troops at India’s Coun\u0002ter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School in Mizoram. U.S. antiterrorism assistance advanced again after the November 2008 terrorist attacks in the commercial district of Mumbai. The U.S. Department of State’s Antiterrorism Assistance Program (ATA) provided enhanced training 23 India’s Naxalite Insurgency consultations with senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officials on the topics of hotel security, rail security, responses to an active shooter incident, as well as major event security management.85 In 2010, the two governments began the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. Since then the dialogue has enabled bilateral cooperation on mutual strategic interests and strengthened “security cooperation through expanded dialogues and exercises as well as shar\u0002ing of advanced technologies.”86 A subsequent 2010 U.S.-India Counterterrorism Cooperation Initiative allows the United States to facilitate capacity-building and training in India across a number of specific areas, including but not limited to: ■ developing investigative skills ■ promoting cooperation between forensic science laboratories ■ establishing procedures to provide mutual investigative assistance ■ improving capabilities to act against money-laundering, counterfeit currency, and terrorist financing ■ trading best practices on mass transit and rail security ■ increasing interactions between coast guards and navies on maritime security ■ exchanging experience and expertise on port and border security ■ enhancing liaison and training between specialist counterterrorism units, including the National Security Guard and its U.S. counterparts.87 Beginning in February 2012, American trainers under the ATA have been training Indian police in cooperation with the MHA. This training includes forensic examination of terrorist crime scenes and advanced explosives incident countermeasures. These courses are also available to state police, for example, in Kolkata (West Bengal). Intelligence agencies of both countries are sharing resources to support specific counterterrorism operations.88 These training courses have had a positive impact upon hundreds of Indian local and national police, including IPS. They have also engaged some members of the MHA special police units such as the Indo-Tibetan Bor\u0002der Police and CPSF. Noteworthy and prudent, these bits of individual training have occurred 24 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 with individual Indian police and paramilitary officers and jawans (junior paramilitary soldiers) who have later participated in counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites and other rebel groups.89 At the same time, though, direct U.S. military engagement with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and security forces units involved in domestic counterinsurgency has remained limited. American military interactions with regular Indian army units also have grown in an im\u0002pressive manner over the past decade. As discussed earlier, Indian, just as American, military and defense leaders are keen to state that India has more joint military training events and exer\u0002cises with the United States than with any other defense partner worldwide.90 Yet India’s civilian defense establishment leadership appears amenable to many military-to-military training and exercise interactions with the United States but continues to view access to military technology to be the litmus test of fruitful bilateral defense relations.91 Although the Indian military highly prizes joint service-to-service interactions and exer\u0002cises, no U.S. military units have been engaged with or even indirectly assisted Indian central police or paramilitary units directly involved in the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations against the Naxalites. In those instances in which the U.S. military and DHS per\u0002sonnel have had interaction with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and paramilitary forces, the rule has been that indirect general skills training is acceptable for Indian leadership, but specific engagement and activities directly with Indian domestic insurgency forces is alto\u0002gether something else. Some analysts have recommended that the United States formally inject direct domestic counterinsurgency assistance into the U.S.-India security relationship. In 2013, one such ana\u0002lyst, Haider Ali Hussein Mullick, made a robust proposal, stating that the United States should formally generate a $400 million India counterinsurgency initiative, jointly run by the Depart\u0002ment of Defense (DOD), State, and DHS.92 He proposed that this initiative should bundle to\u0002gether the indirect assistance provided by the ATA and DOD International Military Education and Training program, as well as establish a Foreign Military Finance Account for India (where one then did not exist) and apportion other money into DHS and Justice department accounts to better enable Federal Bureau of Information resources for its India-focused international po\u0002lice training program. In this well-intentioned recommendation, U.S. largesse could be used to provide vital equipment to India’s CRPF, including armored personnel vehicles, mine-resistant vehicles, flak jackets, GPS trackers, and night-vision goggles. As Indian attack helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were deemed vital for providing counterinsurgency ground 25 India’s Naxalite Insurgency support, this proposal provided for U.S. funding to assist the Indian air force in creating dedi\u0002cated air surveillance and support for the CRPF—including helicopter and UAV support.93 Noble in intent, Mullick’s recommendation of a major U.S. push to provide direct assis\u0002tance to Indian domestic counterinsurgency units and operations remains as misguided today as it was in 2013. Likewise, periodic offers by U.S. defense officials of direct U.S. military assis\u0002tance to Indian counterinsurgency forces are similarly well intentioned but off target.94 These and similar initiatives ultimately push unhelpfully against Indian protection of its absolute sov\u0002ereignty in domestic counterinsurgency operations. Moreover, even if India were to unexpect\u0002edly welcome direct U.S. military and whole-of-government support for its domestic counter\u0002insurgency activities, that very success would create significant problems for the growing but delicate U.S.-India security relationship. These problems are evident in the patterns observed during Indian counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites. Direct American support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations (such as those against the Naxalites) would quickly expose significant divergence between views in Washington and Indian cultural and political concerns with its domestic insurgents. First, In\u0002dians are historically tolerant of long, protracted counterinsurgency operations, including the four-and-a-half-decade Naxalite rebellion, a six-decade swirl of insurgency in northeast India, and the insurgency and rebellion extant in Jammu and Kashmir since 1947. American patience with such protracted counterinsurgency operations has not been a hallmark of its international ventures over the past century. Second, Indian domestic insurgencies have a political cadence and rhythm about them that is alien to American sensibilities. In all three phases of the Naxalite insurgency, state and local political dynamics played to Naxalite sympathizer vote banks, allowing insurgent activi\u0002ties to grow to an uncomfortable level. In the second phase and especially the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency, Indian national police and paramilitary assistance began with limited but targeted security help for local authorities that focused upon managing major events—like election security—but then quickly vanished. Only when the political calculus of local, state, and national officials aligned did coordinated and effective policing, paramilitary, and local as\u0002sistance programs come together. American patience with the dynamics of this Indian political rhythm would be sorely tried. Third, with much of India’s Naxalite insurgency featuring organized criminal activity as its underpinning by 2014–2016, it is arguably more useful and feasible for the United States and India to focus meaningful collaboration on individual policing techniques and investigative activities to counter these dimensions of residual Naxalism. There will be less Indian resistance 26 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 to this kind of DHS-to-MHA support. Thereafter, the focus of the U.S. military and its SOF can then better orient on wider regional and international counterterrorism activities. In addition to these historically supported cautions, direct American training and equip\u0002ment support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations might run afoul of U.S. legisla\u0002tive mandates and human rights standards. All U.S. assistance to foreign security forces must conform to what is known as the Leahy Law, named for legislative author Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). One part of the law applies to State Department foreign assistance programs and the second applies to DOD training and assistance programs for the security forces of a foreign country. Both versions prohibit any U.S. security assistance if the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense have credible information that a military, paramilitary, or police unit of a foreign government has committed a gross violation of human rights in the conduct of its activities— past or present. The law allows for an exception (or waiver) permitting resumption of security assistance if the Secretary of State or Defense reports to Congress that the government of the assisted country is taking effective steps to bring the violating members of the security forces to justice.95 Direct U.S. assistance to India’s paramilitary and police units combatting the Naxalite insurgency (as others) could quickly run into a problem with the Leahy Law. There have been frequent reports of Indian local police units’ involvement in human rights violations against innocents in the Naxalite insurgency areas.96 Indian central policy forces, including units from the CRPF, have been accused of human rights abuses and torture against apprehended militants and presumed supporters in Naxalite-afflicted areas.97 It is hard to imagine Indian pride react\u0002ing well to American demands for certification of the human rights corrections made on its national counterinsurgency paramilitary forces. It also is hard to imagine the U.S.-India security relationship holding up well if, in order to secure training and equipment for its already well-supported national paramilitary units, New Delhi must face repetitive Leahy Law inquiries. Indeed, in a country with growing wealth and a proud belief in the relative successes of its autonomous, indigenous paramilitary counterin\u0002surgency forces, U.S. direct assistance (with strings) is not likely to be well received.98 At the least, such conditioned assistance would strain security relations that both sides desire to see improve. At the worst, the outcome might set back bilateral security progress on far more im\u0002portant U.S.-India security initiatives including those involving joint maritime security activi\u0002ties in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean, interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence sharing and broader operations. 27 India’s Naxalite Insurgency Lessons Learned and Policy Implications for U.S.-India Relations A review of the history of Indian approach to dealing with its Naxalite insurgency indi\u0002cates the unique nature of New Delhi’s approach to domestic security. The limited engagement with the United States on military and security assistance offers also indicates the continuing barriers inhibiting a deep and unbridled bilateral security alliance at this time. A decade of U.S. interaction with India on the Naxalite insurgency reinforces the notion that Washington should not expect New Delhi to become a tightly coupled military ally anytime soon. Instead, New Del\u0002hi is more likely to be a friendly strategic partner with the United States where mutual security interests align, while interacting more often in a restrained and limited manner where U.S. and Indian security interests and prerogatives do not well align—as in the case of the Naxalites.99 Given this insight, U.S. policymakers should focus on bilateral counterterrorism and coun\u0002terinsurgency security cooperation efforts toward externally sponsored Islamist terrorist groups and, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, against actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns. As a complement, U.S. military assistance programs focusing on technical skills and practices for individual Indian police, paramilitary, and SOF will remain most promising and prominent for the foreseeable future. 28 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Appendix A.

Under the reciprocal agreement, both New Delhi and Washington would have the ability, but not the obligation, to assist each other’s armed forces with simple military logistics. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) would allow the United States to supply India with its proprietary encrypted communications equipment and systems, allowing secure peacetime and wartime communication between high-level military leaders on both sides. CISMOA would extend this capability to Indian and U.S. military assets, including aircraft and ships. The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) would set a framework through which the United States could share sensitive data to aid targeting and navigation with India.

The attacks left 1 person dead and more than 60 injured. On October 29, a series of explosions in crowded marketplaces and on a public bus in New Delhi killed approximately 60 and injured more than 150 on the eve of Diwali, India’s most important Hindu holiday. The Indian government blamed the designated foreign terrorist organiza\u0002tion Lashkar e-Tayyiba for the attack.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#content) Author ### [Pearl Pandya](https://acleddata.com/staff/pearl-pandya) South Asia Research Manager _On 21 May, Indian security forces killed the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI (Maoist)), Nambala Keshava Rao, also known as Basavaraju, in Chhattisgarh state. He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&nbsp;_ _In this Q&A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world._ ## **The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it?** The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed.[1](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote1) So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( _see graph below_). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.[2](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote2) Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts.[3](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote3) Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. Close footnote ## How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also [targeted locals](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/) whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes.[4](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote4) Close footnote ## What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk.[5](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote5) And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so.

The slain Maoists were identified as Gautam Paswan, CPI-Maoist ‘Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee (BJSAC)’ member, who had a reward of INR 2.5 million on his head; Ajit Oraon _alias_ Charlis, BJSAC member, with an INR 2.5 million reward; Amar Ganjhu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; Ajay Yadav _alias_ Nandu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; and Sanjeet Bhuiyan, ‘sub-zonal commander’. During the search operation, the dead bodies of the five Maoists along with two AK-47 rifles, one INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, two other rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as items of daily use were recovered. On April 1, 2023, a CPI-Maoist cadre, Sameer Mohonda _alias_ Sadhu Linga (31), a member of the CPI-Maoist ‘Chatgaon Local Organizational Squad’, with a reward of INR 200,000 on his head, was killed in an encounter with C-60 Commandos in the Kiarkoti-Abujhmad Forest area of Bhamragarh _Taluka_ (revenue division) in the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra. Acting on intelligence inputs, the Commandos launched an operation and came under indiscriminate fire from a group of 60 to 70 Maoists hiding in the forest, who used Under Barrel Grenade Launchers (UBGLs) and other weapons. In the retaliatory fire, the C-60 Commandos killed one Maoist, while the others managed to flee into the dense forest. After the firing, which lasted for approximately an hour, the Security Forces (SFs) searched the area and recovered one .303 rifle, one gun, a country-made pistol, three magazines, 31 bullets, INR 38,000, medicines, Maoist literature and other materials. On March 28, 2023, a former deputy _Sarpanch_ (head of the _Panchayat_, village level local self-Government institution), Ramji Dodi, was abducted and killed by CPI-Maoist cadres in Zara village in the Narayanpur District of Chhattisgarh. Dodi was abducted, along with his two nephews, and taken to a forest where he was allegedly strangled to death by the Maoists. The nephews were released with Ramji’s body and a letter saying that he was killed because he was a ‘police informer’. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), there has been a total of 39 fatalities (20 civilians, nine SF personnel and 10 _Naxalites_, Left Wing Extremists) in Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-linked violence in the current year (data till April 9, 2023). During the corresponding period of 2022, the number of such fatalities was 49 (19 civilians, seven SF personnel and 23 _Naxalites_). Through 2022, there was a total of 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) in such violence. In the preceding year (2021), there was a total of 237 fatalities (58 civilians, 51 SF personnel, and 128 _Naxalites_). Overall fatalities were at 239 in 2020, 302 in 2019, 412 in 2018 and 335 in 2017. Overall fatalities have, thus, been on a decline since 2019. Moreover, the overall fatalities in 2022 were the lowest recorded in a single year since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE. Interestingly, the overall fatalities in 2021 were the pervious lowest recorded in a single year. A peak of 1,180 fatalities (630 civilians, 267 SF personnel, 265 _Naxalites_ and 18 unspecified) were recorded in 2010. As with overall fatalities, fatalities in 2022 in all three categories – civilian, SF and _Naxalite_ – were the lowest since 2000. A previous low of 58 in the civilian category was record in 2021. In the SF category, the previous low of 44 was recorded in 2020. A previous low of 87 in the _Naxalite_ category was recorded in 2004. Civilian and _Naxalite_ fatalities have also been on a continuous decline since 2019. SF fatalities have also declined through this period, barring 2021 (51 fatalities) when there was a spike compared to 2020 (44 fatalities). Other parameters of violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation relating to LWE activities across the country. The number of overall LWE-linked terrorist incidents fell from 676 in 2021 to 602 in 2022. In particular, incidents of killing came down from 124 in 2021 to 107 in 2022. Seven of the 107 overall incidents of killing were major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in 2022. In 2021, the number of major incidents was 15. Resultant fatalities from major incidents declined from 114 (seven civilians, 30 SF personnel, and 77 _Naxalites_) in 2021 to 22 (one civilian, three SF personnel, and 18 _Naxalites_) in 2022. In 2023, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents was 169, of which 32 were incidents of killing. Two major incidents have already been recorded in 2023. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2022, at 1:4.46, the best since 2000, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2021, the ratio was at 1:2.5. The ratio has remined in favour of the SFs since 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.61). In the current year, the kill ratio is in favour of the SFs at 1:1.11, so far (data till April 6, 2023). SFs arrested 395 _Naxalites_ in 2022, in addition to 409 in 2021, according to partial data compiled by SATP. In the current year, as on April 6, 2023, 122 arrests had been recorded. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, a total of 15,993 has been recorded. The mounting pressure on _Naxalites_ has yielded a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP, at least 2,855 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2022, in addition to 533 in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of surrenders was 97. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 16,581 LWEs have surrendered. Through 2022, SFs recovered arms from the Maoists in 190 incidents, in addition to 268 such incidents of recovery in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of such incidents are 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,694 incidents of arms recovery are documented. An analysis of over-ground and underground Maoist activities in the country’s LWE-affected areas also suggests a diminishing influence. According to SATP, in 2022, Maoist activities were reported from 10 States in comparison to 11 States in 2021. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 10 affected States have a total of 310 Districts, of which 58 recorded a Maoist presence. Of these 58, three districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 27 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 28 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2021, of 79 affected districts, one district fell in the ‘extremely-affected’ category, four in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 46 were ‘marginally affected’. Indeed, on March 28, 2023, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, in a written reply to a question in the _Lok Sabha_ (Lower House of the Indian Parliament), announced that the number of districts most affected by LWE had reduced from 35 in 2017 to 30 in April 2018, and then to 25 in July **[2021](https://pqals.nic.in/annex/1711/AU4464.pdf)**. Further, on March 28, 2023, the Government stated that the “geographical spread of violence has significantly reduced and only 176 Police Stations of 45 districts reported LWE violence in 2022, as compared to a high of 465 Police Stations of 96 districts in 2010”. Conspicuously, all major LWE-affected states across the country — **[Andhra Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-30)**, **[Bihar](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-31#assessment2)**, **[Chhattisgarh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-29#assessment2)**, **[Jharkhand](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-33#assessment2)**, **[Kerala](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-39#assessment2)**, **[Madhya Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-40#assessment2)**, **[Maharashtra](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-38#assessment2)**, **[Odisha](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-34#assessment2)**, and **[Telangana](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-37)** have witnessed an overall improvement in the security situation. Nevertheless, the Maoist challenge persists. OThe Perilous **[Bastar Division](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-22#assessment2)**, the safe haven of the residual Maoist problem not only in Chhattisgarh but across the entire LWE-affected region, comprising seven densely forested districts - Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur and Sukma - sprawling across 40,000 square kilometers, in the southernmost region of the state, is the location of the last Maoist bastions. On November 7, 2022, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar Range, Sundarraj P., asserting that the SFs were committed to wiping out the Maoist threat, nevertheless accepted, | | | --- | | In Bastar Range, though civilian killings have reduced to a great extent, from 279 in the year 2006, to 29 in 2022, it is still an area of major concern in left-wing extremist affected areas. | Indeed, on March 28, 2023, the Maoists abducted and killed two villagers, in Narayanpur and Sukma Districts, branding them as ‘Police informers’ (incidents mentioned above). Moreover, the early data for 2023 suggests that SF dominance on the ground, purely in terms of the kill ratio, has weakened during the first three months of 2023, as compared to the whole of 2022 and earlier. Not surprisingly, civilian insecurity has escalated. Disturbingly, more than a few deficits in the fighting forces remained noticeable in some of the worst Maoist-afflicted States, according to the _Bureau of Police Research & Development_ (BPR&D) data. BPR&D disclosed, as on January 1, 2021, that there were at least 28 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst affected State, that had no telephone. In Jharkhand, 47 had no vehicle, 211 had no telephone, and 31 had no wireless/mobile connectivity. In Andhra Pradesh, 65 Police Stations had no vehicle, and 34 had no wireless/mobile connectivity; and in Odisha, four had no vehicle, and three had no telephone. Moreover, large vacancies persist in the State Police Forces. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2021, against the sanctioned strength of 1,109,260 there were a total of 838,481 policemen in position in 10 LWE-affected States, leaving a vacancy of 270,779, i.e., 24.41 per cent. At the national level, deficits against sanctioned strength were 20.34 per cent, almost the same as the shortage in the Maoist affected States. The police-population ratio (policemen per hundred thousand population) of these 12 States had increased from an average of 138.63 in 2018 to 149.42 in 2019. Meanwhile, the all-India police-population ratio had increased from 150.80 in 2018 to 158.22 in 2019, significantly higher than the levels in the LWE affected States. Importantly, existing police-population ratios in these 12 states remained significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 183.97. At the national level, the existing levels were also significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 198.65 per 100,000. Moreover, the number of vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) of these 12 States was 595 (22.44 per cent), as against 948 (19.97 per cent) at the national level, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. These critical deficiencies in the enforcement apparatuses need urgent attention if the gains against the Maoists are to be consolidated further. The Maoists are down, but yet not out. The overall declining trend in Maoist violence and activity across the country needs to be contained with further security interventions with a sense of urgency, as the Maoists have shown incredible capacities for resurrection in the past, and retain substantial operational and overground capabilities in significant areas of their erstwhile regions of dominance. The SFs will have to overcome prevailing operational and capacity deficits, to prevent any rebel resurgence. | [Assessments Year

Not for Redistribution International Monetary Fund | April 2016 ix A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook (WEO). It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during Feb\u0002ruary 2–March 1, 2016, except for those for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II), which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for selected economies, see Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $34.75 a barrel in 2016 and $40.99 a barrel in 2017 and will remain unchanged in real terms over the medium term; that the six-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on U.S. dollar deposits will average 0.9 percent in 2016 and 1.5 percent in 2017; that the three-month euro deposit rate will average –0.3 percent in 2016 and –0.4 percent in 2017; and that the six-month Japanese yen deposit rate will yield on average –0.1 percent in 2016 and –0.3 per\u0002cent in 2017. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would in any event be involved in the projections. The estimates and projec\u0002tions are based on statistical information available through March 25, 2016. The following conventions are used throughout the WEO: . . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable; – between years or months (for example, 2015–16 or January–June) to indicate the years or months cov\u0002ered, including the beginning and ending years or months; / between years or months (for example, 2015/16) to indicate a fiscal or financial year. “Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion. “Basis points” refers to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of 1 percentage point). Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and government finance data for each country. For some countries, the figures for 2015 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments indicators for each country. • Data for Macao Special Administrative Region and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are included in data aggregated for the advanced economies. Macao is a Special Administrative Region of China, and Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States, but the WEO maintains statistical data for both economies on a separate and independent basis. • Argentina’s and Venezuela’s consumer prices are excluded from all the WEO groups’ aggregates. In the tables and figures, the following conventions apply: • If no source is listed on tables and figures, data are drawn from the WEO database. • When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size. • Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding. As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

Not for Redistribution International Monetary Fund | April 2016 xi WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TENSIONS FROM THE TWO-SPEED RECOVERY FURTHER INFORMATION AND DATA This version of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) is available in full through the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary. imf.org) and the IMF website (www.imf.org). Accompanying the publication on the IMF website is a larger com\u0002pilation of data from the WEO database than is included in the report itself, including files containing the series most frequently requested by readers. These files may be downloaded for use in a variety of software packages. The data appearing in the World Economic Outlook are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of the WEO exer\u0002cises. The historical data and projections are based on the information gathered by the IMF country desk officers in the context of their missions to IMF member countries and through their ongoing analysis of the evolving situ\u0002ation in each country. Historical data are updated on a continual basis as more information becomes available, and structural breaks in data are often adjusted to produce smooth series with the use of splicing and other techniques. IMF staff estimates continue to serve as proxies for historical series when complete information is unavailable. As a result, WEO data can differ from those in other sources with official data, including the IMF’s International Financial Statistics. The WEO data and metadata provided are “as is” and “as available,” and every effort is made to ensure their timeliness, accuracy, and completeness, but it cannot be guaranteed. When errors are discovered, there is a con\u0002certed effort to correct them as appropriate and feasible. Corrections and revisions made after publication are incorporated into the electronic editions available from the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.imf.org) and on the IMF website (www.imf.org). All substantive changes are listed in detail in the online tables of contents. For details on the terms and conditions for usage of the WEO database, please refer to the IMF Copyright and Usage website (www.imf.org/external/terms.htm).

Not for Redistribution xii International Monetary Fund | April 2016 The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s surveil\u0002lance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a comprehen\u0002sive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department, European Depart\u0002ment, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department—together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department, the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, and the Fiscal Affairs Department. The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of Maurice Obstfeld, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, Deputy Director, Research Department, and Oya Celasun, Division Chief, Research Department. The primary contributors to this report were Rudolfs Bems, Luis Catão, Romain Duval, Davide Furceri, Alexan\u0002der Hijzen, João Jalles, Sinem Kılıç Çelik, Zsóka Kóczán, Weicheng Lian, and Marcos Poplawski-Ribeiro.

Michael Harrup from the Communications Department led the editorial team for the report, with production and editorial support from Christine Ebrahimzadeh and editorial assistance from Lucy Scott Morales, Linda Long, Lorraine Coffey, Gregg Forte, and EEI Communications. The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff members from other IMF departments, as well as by Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on March 28, 2016.

PREFACE ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Global recovery continues, but at an ever\u0002slowing and increasingly fragile pace. The months since the last World Economic Outlook have seen a renewed episode of global asset market volatility, some loss of growth momentum in the advanced economies, and continu\u0002ing headwinds for emerging market economies and lower-income countries. In addition, several stresses of noneconomic origin threaten economic activity. Not only do these developments lead us to a further broad-based reduction in our baseline projections for economic growth in 2016 and 2017; they also suggest that possible nonbaseline outcomes are at the same time less favorable and more likely. Notwithstanding this cloudier picture of economic fundamentals, financial markets in advanced econo\u0002mies have, at this writing, partially reversed their swoon of the first weeks of 2016. Some improved data releases, a firming of oil prices, lower capital outflows from China, and decisions by major central banks have all contributed to improved sentiment. These developments are consistent with our central projec\u0002tion that growth over the next two years, while lower than we believed likely just a few months ago, will still be slightly higher than in 2015. Yet that outcome is far from assured. Significant downside risks remain, and events that make those risks more salient may well trigger renewed financial turbulence. What are the risks? Important among purely economic risks is a return of financial turmoil itself, impairing confidence and demand in a self-confirming negative feedback loop. Despite the recent rebound in asset prices, financial conditions in the United States, Europe, and Japan have been on a tightening trend since mid-2014, as the new Global Financial Stability Report documents. Yet financial conditions have tightened even more outside the advanced economies. Increased net capital outflows from emerging markets—the subject of Chapter 2 of this World Economic Outlook report— could lead to further depreciation of their currencies, eventually triggering adverse balance sheet effects. Market perceptions of constrained macroeconomic policy space added to the recent bout of pessimism. These worries remain and are especially relevant for emerging market and developing economies. China, now the world’s largest economy on a purchasing-power-parity basis, is navigating a momen\u0002tous but complex transition toward more sustainable growth based on consumption and services. Ulti\u0002mately, that process will benefit both China and the world. Given China’s important role in global trade, however, bumps along the way could have substantial spillover effects, especially on emerging market and developing economies. Another threat is that persistent slow growth has scarring effects that themselves reduce potential output and with it, consumption and investment. Consecutive downgrades of future economic prospects carry the risk of a world economy that reaches stalling speed and falls into widespread secular stagnation. Adding to this list are several pressures with origins in political, geopolitical, or natural developments. In both the United States and Europe, the political discussion is turning increasingly inward. The causes are complex but certainly reflect growing income inequality as well as structural shifts, some connected with global\u0002ization, that are seen as having favored economic elites while leaving others behind. Fear of terrorism also plays a role. The result could be a turn toward more national\u0002istic policies, including protectionist ones. In the United Kingdom, the planned June refer\u0002endum on European Union membership has already created uncertainty for investors; a “Brexit” could do severe regional and global damage by disrupting estab\u0002lished trading relationships. Adding to political strains in Europe is the tragedy of large-scale refugee inflows, especially from the Middle East. Of course, a sizable fraction of refugee flows originates in violent extrem\u0002ism or sectarian strife, factors that devastate source economies and threaten their neighbors. Yet there are also natural causes of population displacement, some linked to climate change. Extreme flooding and drought from the current El Niño is worsening pov\u0002erty and displacement in a range of emerging markets and low-income developing countries. FOREWORD International Monetary Fund | April 2016 xiii ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO SLOW FOR TOO LONG Apart from these risks, the April World Economic Outlook also describes a further weakening of global growth under its baseline scenario. An important cause is that demand, notably investment demand, remains weak worldwide, but especially in commod\u0002ity exporters, whose terms of trade have collapsed. China’s rebalancing process has subtracted measur\u0002ably from world investment growth, and generally higher uncertainty about global growth prospects is also a factor. Weak investment demand, in turn, has been associated with slower growth in international trade, given the important roles played by capital and intermediate goods. Emerging market and especially low-income com\u0002modity exporters will struggle to restore growth until they have diversified their export bases, a process that will take time. While in principle terms-of-trade losses by commodity exporters should translate into symmetric gains for importers, in practice the negative effects on producers seem to have dominated so far. The situation is not without precedent. In his classic 1973 book The World in Depression: 1929–1939, Charles P. Kindleberger noted a similar dynamic in the commodity price defla\u0002tion of the 1920s: “The view taken here is that symme\u0002try may obtain in the scholar’s study, but that it is hard to find in the real world. . . . The consuming countries might ultimately have realized that their real incomes had increased and permitted them to expand spend\u0002ing. Meanwhile the primary producers cannot wait.” As Chapter 1 in this World Economic Outlook report points out, commodity importers with policy interest rates currently near zero will face an additional offset to the positive income effect of lower commodity prices. A diminished economic outlook burdened with larger downside risks raises the premium on intensify\u0002ing and extending sound policies that safeguard near\u0002term growth and boost potential output. Monetary policy must remain accommodative in the face of deflationary pressures, including through additional unconventional measures if needed. But monetary policy cannot bear the entire burden of responding to current challenges; it must be supported by other poli\u0002cies that directly boost supply and demand. Infrastructure investment is needed across a range of countries and should be attractive in a setting of very low real interest rates. Countries with fiscal space should not wait to take advantage of it. Public action to encourage research and development activity, as documented in the new Fiscal Monitor, can boost output. At the same time, as Chapter 3 in this World Economic Outlook report shows, structural reforms in product and labor markets can be effective in boost\u0002ing output, even in the short term, and especially if coupled with fiscal support. Tax reform, even when budget neutral, can create demand if well targeted, while simultaneously improving labor force participa\u0002tion and enhancing social cohesion. Not only financial stability, but the transmission of monetary and fiscal policy, would be enhanced by further financial reforms, including the resolution of impaired assets still held on banks’ books. These measures should be taken now, but countries should also cooperate to design collective measures to be deployed in the future in case downside risks materialize. A range of demand- and supply-side policies can be more effective through positive output spillovers across countries; policymakers could already formulate contingent plans. In addition, cooperation to enhance the global financial safety net and the global regulatory regime is central to a resilient international monetary and finan\u0002cial system. Some of the risks coming from noneco\u0002nomic sources likewise present public goods problems solvable through international coordination, on the model of the December 2015 Paris climate agreement. The current diminished outlook and associated downside possibilities warrant an immediate response. If national policymakers were to clearly recognize the risks they jointly face and act together to prepare for them, the positive effects on global confidence could be substantial. The result would be stronger growth under the baseline outcome as well as insurance against a derailed recovery. Maurice Obstfeld Economic Counsellor xiv International Monetary Fund | April 2016 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EXECUTIVE SUMMARY International Monetary Fund | April 2016 xv The baseline projection for global growth in 2016 is a modest 3.2 percent, broadly in line with last year, and a 0.2 percentage point downward revision rela\u0002tive to the January 2016 World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update. The recovery is projected to strengthen in 2017 and beyond, driven primarily by emerging market and developing economies, as conditions in stressed economies start gradually to normalize. But uncertainty has increased, and risks of weaker growth scenarios are becoming more tangible. The fragile con\u0002juncture increases the urgency of a broad-based policy response to raise growth and manage vulnerabilities. The global recovery has weakened further amid increasing financial turbulence. Activity softened toward the end of 2015 in advanced economies, and stresses in several large emerging market economies showed no signs of abating. Adding to these head\u0002winds are concerns about the global impact of the unwinding of prior excesses in China’s economy as it transitions to a more balanced growth path after a decade of strong credit and investment growth, along with signs of distress in other large emerging markets, including from falling commodity prices. With heightened risk aversion and increasing concerns about the lack of policy space, the valuation of risky assets as well as oil prices dropped sharply in early 2016. However, market sentiment began to improve in mid-February, and by the end of March market valuations had recovered most of or all the ground lost earlier in the year. While growth in emerging market and develop\u0002ing economies still accounts for the lion’s share of projected world growth in 2016, prospects across countries remain uneven and generally weaker than over the past two decades. In particular, a number of large emerging markets—including Brazil and Rus\u0002sia—are still mired in deep recessions. Others, includ\u0002ing several oil-exporting countries, also face a difficult macroeconomic environment with sharply weaker terms of trade and tighter external financial condi\u0002tions. Growth in China and India has been broadly in line with projections, but trade growth has slowed down noticeably. The trade slowdown is related to the decline in investment growth across emerging market economies, which reflects rebalancing in China but also the sharp scaling down of investment in com\u0002modity exporters, particularly those facing difficult macroeconomic conditions. Growth in advanced economies is projected to remain modest, in line with 2015 outcomes. Unfavor\u0002able demographic trends, low productivity growth, and legacies from the global financial crisis continue to hamper a more robust pickup in activity. While very accommodative monetary policy and lower oil prices will support domestic demand, still-weak external demand, further exchange rate appreciation—especially in the United States—and somewhat tighter financial conditions will weigh on the recovery. In the euro area, the risk of a deanchoring of inflation expectations is a concern amid large debt overhangs in several countries. The projected pickup in growth in 2017 (3.5 percent) and over the rest of the forecast horizon hinges crucially on rising growth in emerging market and developing economies, as growth in advanced economies is expected to remain modest, in line with weakened potential growth. This outcome relies on a number of important assumptions: • A gradual normalization of conditions in several economies currently under stress • A successful rebalancing of China’s economy with trend growth rates that—while lower than those of the past two decades—remain high • A pickup in activity in commodity exporters, albeit at rates more modest than in the past • Resilient growth in other emerging market and developing economies In the current environment, the likelihood that this central scenario will materialize has weakened, as risks of weaker growth have become more salient. • Across advanced economies, activity slowed during the second part of 2015, and asset price declines and widening spreads have tightened financial conditions. If sustained, these developments could further weaken growth, with risks of a stagnation scenario with persistent negative output gaps and excessively low inflation. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO SLOW FOR TOO LONG • Emerging market stress could rise further, also reflecting domestic vulnerabilities. For instance, an additional bout of exchange rate depreciations could further worsen corporate balance sheets, and a sharp decline in capital inflows could force a rapid compression of domestic demand. • A protracted period of low oil prices could further destabilize the outlook for oil-exporting countries. While some countries still have sizable buffers, these are eroding, and some countries already face the need for sharp expenditure cuts. • The rebalancing process in China may be less smooth than assumed in the baseline scenario. A sharper slowdown in China than currently projected could have strong international spillovers through trade, commodity prices, and confidence, and lead to a more generalized slowdown in the global economy, especially if it further curtailed expecta\u0002tions of future income. • Shocks of a noneconomic origin—related to geopo\u0002litical conflicts, political discord, terrorism, refugee flows, or global epidemics—loom over some coun\u0002tries and regions, and, if left unchecked, could have significant spillovers on global economic activity. On the upside, the recent decline in oil prices may boost demand in oil-importing countries more strongly than currently envisaged, including through consumers’ possible perception that prices will remain lower for longer. More aggressive policy actions to lift demand and supply potential, as discussed in the fol\u0002lowing paragraph, could also foster stronger growth, in both the short and longer term. This could also help boost financial market confidence, and imply a recov\u0002ery in equity prices and an unwinding of the recent tightening in financial conditions. The fragile conjuncture increases the urgency of a broad-based policy response that safeguards near-term growth, while raising potential output, and manages vulnerabilities. • Strengthening growth. In advanced economies, secur\u0002ing higher and sustainable growth requires a three\u0002pronged approach consisting of mutually reinforcing (1) structural reforms, (2) continued monetary policy accommodation, and (3) fiscal support—in the form of growth-friendly fiscal policies where adjustment is needed and fiscal stimulus where space allows. On the supply side, implementing a credible and country-specific structural reform agenda that takes into account both the short- and medium-term impact of reforms is a key element of the comprehensive strategy. Reforms that entail fiscal stimulus (for example, reducing labor tax wedges and increasing public spending on active labor market policies) and reforms that lower barriers to entry in product and services markets may be most valuable at this juncture, as they can provide some near\u0002term demand support, not only through increased confidence and expectations of higher future income, but directly. On the demand side, accommodative monetary policy remains essential where output gaps are negative and inflation is too low. However, with interest rates at historic lows, a more comprehensive strategy is needed to ensure higher growth. Monetary policy must be complemented by concerted efforts to accelerate the repair of private sector balance sheetsespecially in the euro areato improve monetary policy transmission, ensure orderly deleveraging and bolster credit supply, and contain financial sector risks. Stronger near-term fiscal policy support, with a focus on boosting future productive capacity and financing demand-friendly structural reformswhere needed and where fiscal space is availableshould provide a fillip to growth. • Securing resilience. In emerging market and develop\u0002ing economies, policymakers should reduce macro\u0002economic and financial vulnerabilities and rebuild resilience, including by implementing productivity\u0002enhancing reforms. In some commodity exporters, fiscal buffers can help smooth the adjustment to lower commodity prices, but it will be important to plan for fiscal adjustment to durably lower com\u0002modity revenues and new, more diverse growth models. In others, financial strains may limit the room to implement a gradual adjustment. Exchange rate flexibility, where feasible, should also be used to cushion the impact of adverse terms-of-trade shocks, although the effects of exchange rate depreciations on private and public sector balance sheets and on domestic inflation need to be closely monitored. Establishing fiscal policy frameworks that anchor longer-term plans will help build resilience by allow\u0002ing smoother expenditure adjustment in response to adverse shocks. In commodity importers, whether all the gains should be saved depends on the extent of economic slack, the availability of fiscal space, and countries’ needs. In particular, these gains may provide an opportunity to finance critical structural reforms or growth-enhancing spending. xvi International Monetary Fund | April 2016 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ExECuTIvE SuMMary The threat of synchronized slowdown, the increase in the already significant downside risks, and restricted policy space in many economies call for bold multilat\u0002eral actions to boost growth and contain risks at this critical stage of the global recovery. • The international policy response. Should a significant shortfall in growth threaten to push the global econ\u0002omy back into recession, a collective macroeconomic policy reaction would be needed. Policymakers in the larger economies should proactively identify additional policy actions that could be implemented quickly if there are signs that global downside risks are about to materialize. • Enhancing the global financial safety net and oversight. To address the potentially protracted risks faced by commodity exporters and emerging markets with strong fundamentals but high susceptibility to shocks, there may be a need to consider reforms to the global financial safety net. There also remains a pressing need at the global level to complement and implement the regulatory reform agenda. • Ring-fencing spillovers from noneconomic shocks. A few countries are currently bearing the brunt of the spill\u0002overs with often limited capacity and fiscal space. A coordinated worldwide initiative should sup\u0002port their efforts, with those at risk from spillovers contributing financial resources, and multilateral agencies, including the IMF, reassessing how they can best help channel those resources to areas in greatest need. International Monetary Fund | April 2016 xvii This page intentionally left blank ©lnternational Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution International Monetary Fund | April 2016 1 Recent Developments and Prospects Major macroeconomic realignments are affecting prospects differentially across countries and regions. These include the slowdown and rebalancing in China; a further decline in commodity prices, especially for oil, with sizable redistributive consequences across sectors and countries; a related slowdown in investment and trade; and declining capital flows to emerging market and developing economies. These realignments— together with a host of noneconomic factors, including geopolitical tensions and political discord—are gen\u0002erating substantial uncertainty. On the whole, they are consistent with a subdued outlook for the world economy—but risks of much weaker global growth have also risen. The World Economy in Recent Months Preliminary data suggest that global growth during the second half of 2015, at 2.8 percent, was weaker than previously forecast, with a sizable slowdown during the last quarter of the year (Figure 1.1). The unexpected weakness in late 2015 reflected to an important extent softer activity in advanced economies—especially in the United States, but also in Japan and other advanced Asian economies. The picture for emerging markets is quite diverse, with high growth rates in China and most of emerg\u0002ing Asia, but severe macroeconomic conditions in Brazil, Russia, and a number of other commodity exporters. • Growth in the United States fell to 1.4 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2015. While some of the reasons for this decline—including very weak exports—are likely to prove temporary, final domestic demand was weaker as well, with a decline in nonresidential investment, including outside the energy sector. Despite signs of weakening growth, labor market indicators contin\u0002ued to improve. In particular, employment growth was very strong, labor force participation rebounded, and the unemployment rate continued its downward trend, with a 4.5 percent reading in March. • The recovery was broadly in line with the January forecast in the euro area, as strengthening domestic demand offset a weaker external impulse. Among countries, growth was weaker than expected in Italy but the recovery was stronger in Spain. • In Japan, growth came out significantly lower than expected during the fourth quarter, reflecting in particular a sharp drop in private consumption. • Economic activity in other Asian advanced econo\u0002mies closely integrated with China—such as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan Province of China—weakened sharply during the first half of 2015, owing in part to steep declines in exports. Activity picked up by less than expected during the second half of the year, as domestic demand remained subdued and the recovery in exports was relatively modest. • Growth in China was in contrast slightly stronger than previously forecast, reflecting resilient domestic demand, especially consumption. Robust growth in the services sector offset recent weakness in manu\u0002facturing activity. • In Latin America, the downturn in Brazil was deeper than expected, while activity for the remainder of the region was broadly in line with forecasts. • The recession in Russia in 2015 was broadly in line with expectations, and conditions worsened in most other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) economies, affected by spillovers from Russia as well as the adverse impact of lower oil prices on net oil-exporting countries. • Macroeconomic indicators suggest that economic activ\u0002ity in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East—for which quarterly GDP series are not broadly available— also fell short of expectations, a result of the drop in oil prices, declines in other commodity prices, and geopolitical and domestic strife in a few countries. • More generally, geopolitical tensions have been weigh\u0002ing on global growth. Output contractions in three particularly affected countries—Ukraine, Libya, and Yemen, which accounted for about half a percentage point of global GDP in 2013—subtracted 0.1 per\u0002centage point from global output during 2014–15.

Not for Redistribution 4 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 • Global industrial production, particularly of capital goods, remained subdued throughout 2015. This weakness is consistent with depressed investment worldwide—particularly in energy and mining—as well as the deceleration of China’s manufacturing activity. Low Inflation Headline inflation in advanced economies in 2015, at 0.3 percent on average, was the lowest since the global financial crisis, mostly reflecting the sharp decline in commodity prices, with a pickup in the late part of 2015 (Figure 1.2). Core inflation remained broadly stable at 1.6–1.7 percent but was still well below central bank tar\u0002gets. In many emerging markets, lower prices for oil and other commodities (including food, which has a larger weight in the consumer price indices of emerging market and developing economies) have tended to reduce inflation, but in a number of countries, such as Brazil, Colombia, and Russia, sizable currency depreciations have offset to a large extent the effect of lower commod\u0002ity prices, and inflation has risen. Declining Commodity Prices Oil prices decreased further by 32 percent between August 2015 and February 2016 (that is, between the reference period for the October World Economic Out\u0002look [WEO] and that for the current WEO report) on account of strong supply from members of the Orga\u0002nization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, expectations of higher supply from the Islamic Republic of Iran, and concerns about the resilience of global demand and medium-term growth prospects, as well as risk-off behavior in financial markets, leading investors to move away from commodities as well as stocks (Figure 1.3). Coal and natural gas prices also declined, as the latter are linked to oil prices, including through oil-indexed contract prices. Nonfuel commod\u0002ity prices weakened as well, with metal and agricultural commodities prices declining by 9 percent and 4 per\u0002cent, respectively. Excess oil supply pushed inventory levels in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries to record-high levels despite the strong oil demand that much lower prices spurred in 2015.1 Oil prices recovered some ground in March, on the back of improved financial market sentiment. 1Global oil demand growth in 2015 is estimated to have been about 1.6 million barrels a day, significantly above earlier forecasts by the International Energy Agency.

Across advanced economies, the Japanese yen’s appreciation (about 10 percent in real effective terms) was particularly sharp, while the U.S. dollar and the euro strengthened by about 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively. In contrast, the British pound depreciated by 7 percent, driven by expectations of a later normal\u0002ization of monetary policy in the United Kingdom and concerns about a potential exit from the European Union. Among emerging market economies, depreciations were particularly sharp in South Africa, Mexico, Rus\u0002sia, and Colombia. The Chinese renminbi depreciated by about 2 percent, while the Indian rupee remained broadly stable. Since February, the currencies of commodity\u0002exporting advanced and emerging market economies have generally rebounded, reflecting a decline in global risk aversion and some recovery in commodity prices (Figure 1.4, red bars). Conversely, the dollar has depre\u0002ciated by about 1½ percent and the euro by about 1 percent. The decline in demand for emerging market assets was also reflected in a slowdown in capital inflows, as discussed extensively in Chapter 2. This decline was particularly steep during the second half of 2015, with net sales by foreign investors of portfolio holdings in emerging markets for the first time since the global financial crisis (Figure 1.5). Balance of payments developments in China loom large in explaining the dynamics of aggregate flows to and from emerging markets during this period. Motivated by changing expectations about the renminbi/dollar exchange rate since last summer, Chinese corporations undertook substantial repayments of dollar-denominated exter\u0002nal debt (generating negative capital inflows), while Chinese residents increased their acquisitions of foreign assets (boosting capital outflows). With a tightly man\u0002aged exchange rate, both developments have implied a substantial decline in China’s foreign exchange reserves. Across emerging market and developing economies, reserves declined in a number of oil-exporting coun\u0002tries with exchange rate pegs, as sharply lower oil revenues weighed on current account balances. –1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 USA Euro area Japan Other Adv.

Not for Redistribution 6 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Monetary Policy and Financial Conditions Financial market volatility, which had subsided in October–November, increased again in December and especially in early 2016, amid rising global risk aversion, substantial declines in global equity markets, widening of credit spreads, and historically low yields for safe-haven government bonds (Figures 1.6–1.9). These developments were triggered by concerns about lack of policy space in advanced economies to respond to a potential worsening in the outlook, worries about the effects of very low oil prices, and questions about the speed at which China’s economy is slowing as well as its authorities’ policy intentions. Since mid-February markets have rallied, recovering most or all of the ground lost earlier this year.

Spreads broadly moved sideways in a number of other emerging markets in Asia and Europe and narrowed in Russia. Financial conditions in advanced economies, while remaining accommodative overall, have seen some tightening associated with increasing yields in seg\u0002ments of corporate debt markets. Declining inflation expectations in the euro area are also contributing to tighter financial conditions by pushing up real interest rates. At the same time, long-term government bond yields in Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States have declined sharply since Sep\u0002tember (30 to 60 basis points), reflecting both flight to safety and increased risk aversion, as well as actual and anticipated monetary policy responses to generally weaker inflation and growth expectations. Market tur\u0002bulence had reflected to an important extent concerns regarding the prospects of financial sectors relating to fears of a persistent softening in global growth and its impact on already-weak profitability, unaddressed debt overhang legacies and changes in the regulatory environment in Europe, exposures to the commodity sector, and persistently low interest rates. Monetary policy in advanced economies remains very accommodative, but with asymmetric shifts in the policy stance. In December the U.S. Federal Reserve raised policy rates above the zero lower bound for the first time since 2009, and it has communicated that any future policy actions will remain data dependent. On the other hand, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced a package of further easing measures in March, comprising an expansion of its asset purchase program, including purchases of corporate bonds, new longer-term refinancing operations, and a further reduction in all policy rates. And in late January the Bank of Japan introduced a negative interest rate on marginal excess reserves. In the United Kingdom, pol\u0002icy rates remain on hold at 50 basis points, and with a more subdued inflation outlook, expectations of inter\u0002est rate increases have moved farther into the future. The monetary policy stance has also moved in different directions across emerging markets. A num\u0002ber of commodity exporters have raised policy rates in response to currency depreciation and associated changes in inflation and inflation expectations (notably Mexico and South Africa, but also Chile, Colombia, and Peru). In contrast, policy rates have been eased in Sources: Bloomberg, L.P.; EPFR Global; Haver Analytics; IMF, International Financial Statistics; and IMF staff calculations.

Not for Redistribution 10 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 size, openness, and high investment rate and the high import content of its investment and exports, the slowdown has entailed sizable global spillovers through trade channels. These trade effects are both direct (reduced demand for trading partners’ products) and indirect (impact on world prices for specific goods that China imports––for example, commodities), affecting other countries’ exchange rates and asset markets. • Trade—China is one of the main (top 10) trading partners of more than 100 economies that account for about 80 percent of world GDP. Given its key role in global and regional supply chains—import\u0002ing intermediate and capital goods and exporting processed goods—China can also be a conduit for shocks that originate in other countries. Further\u0002more, over the past decade, China’s role as a source of final demand has increased markedly: China’s imports of final capital goods and consumption goods from Europe and the United States are mate\u0002rial. IMF staff analysis suggests that a 1 percentage point investment-driven drop in China’s output growth would reduce Group of Twenty (G20) growth by ¼ percentage point. Indeed, Figure 1.10 suggests that among countries in which China accounts for a large share of exports of value added, those with the highest shares tended to experience larger declines of export growth in 2015 relative to 2012–14. • Commodities—China is a major importer across a range of commodities, especially metals, for which it accounted for about 40 percent of total global demand in 2014. China’s investment slowdown has had a significant impact on the demand for and prices of those commodities closely related to invest\u0002ment activities—indeed, metal prices have fallen steadily since early 2011 (by almost 60 percent on average). This has generated substantial excess capacity in mining sectors and forced exporters to adjust to lower revenues (see Chapter 2 of the October 2015 WEO). In contrast, China’s demand for oil remained strong in 2015, also reflecting the accumulation of inventories. • Manufacturing—Excess capacity in some segments of the Chinese manufacturing sector can contrib\u0002ute to lowering the prices of specific manufactured products (for example, steel) and hence affect Chi\u0002na’s competitors, reducing their profits and possibly investment rates. Commodity Price Declines and Disposable Income The recent further declines in prices of commodi\u0002ties, especially oil, have compounded sizable shifts in international relative prices since 2011. These shifts have generated sharp changes in disposable income across countries. A simple proxy for these changes can be constructed by calculating the impact of variations in terms of trade on a country’s disposable income.2 As shown in panel 1 of Figure 1.11, the steep declines in oil prices during the second half of 2014 and late 2015 triggered large income losses for oil-exporting coun\u0002tries and gains for oil-importing countries. Relative to GDP, the windfall losses for oil-exporting countries 2The proportional effect on disposable income for year t is calcu\u0002lated as the percentage change in export prices between years t and t–1 multiplied by nominal exports in year t–1, minus the percent\u0002age change in import prices between years t and t–1 multiplied by nominal imports in year t–1, with the preceding difference divided by nominal GDP in year t–1. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 –6 –5 –4 –3 –2 –1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 NZL DEU SVK MYS JPN PHL SGP USA FIN ISR IND THA IDN KOR HKG China’s share of value-added exports (percent) Figure 1.10.

Terms-of-Trade Windfall Gains and Losses, Domestic Demand, Imports, and Output The recent declines in commodity prices have generated sharp changes in disposable income across countries. Domestic demand has tended to strengthen in countries with terms-of-trade gains and weaken in those with losses. The responses of real output have typically been smaller, as net exports have tended to improve in countries with losses and weaken in those with gains, in some cases facilitated by exchange rate adjustments. –25 –20 –15 –10 –5 0 5 KWT QAT SAU DZA VEN ARE KAZ RUS IRN UKR NOR NGA BRA AUS MEX CAN COL CHL EGY PER MMR MYS ARG VNM PAK 1.

Domestic demand has tended to strengthen in countries with terms-of\u0002trade gains and weaken among those with losses, with dramatic contractions among some of the hardest hit (Figure 1.11, panels 2–4). On average, a 1 percentage point loss in income induced by weaker terms of trade subtracted about 0.6 percentage point from domes\u0002tic demand growth in 2014–15 relative to 2012–13. Among the components of domestic demand, invest\u0002ment responded particularly strongly, as discussed in the following section. The response of real imports was larger than that of domestic demand: for instance, a country experiencing a windfall loss of 1 percent of GDP saw, on average, a 1 percentage point decline in real import growth. For countries experiencing terms\u0002of-trade losses, weaker imports—together with a mild but positive response in export growth—cushioned the impact of the terms-of-trade decline on domestic output: for each percentage point loss in income, real GDP growth weakened on average by about 0.22 percentage point (Figure 1.11, panel 5). Investment in Energy and Mining One important channel through which changes in commodity prices affect aggregate demand is through their impact on investment, particularly in energy and mining, which are very capital-intensive activities. Investment was high during the commod\u0002ity price boom but has declined sharply in recent years. For instance, estimates of investment spending in the oil and gas sector in major energy exporters indicate a fall of 24 percent in 2015 in dollar terms relative to a year earlier (Figure 1.12). The decline corresponds to 0.28 percent of 2014 global GDP measured at market exchange rates. While this may overstate the decline in real terms in light of the appreciation of the dollar (which reduces the dollar value of capital spending undertaken in different currencies), the direct drag on 2015 global GDP growth is still sizable. As shown in the second panel of Figure 1.12, investment weakness appears to have extended to exporters of extractive products more broadly; coun\u00023Emerging market and developing economies that are fuel exporters accounted for about 12 percent of global GDP measured at purchasing power parity in 2014–15. tries where energy and mining products account for a larger share of GDP experienced large declines in domestic investment in 2015 relative to the previous three years. In turn, the weakness in investment has contributed to weakness in global manufacturing activity and trade. Slowdown in Global Investment and Trade Figure 1.13 provides further evidence on the global slowdown in investment and shows how declining real investment growth is mirrored by weakness in real import growth.4 Trade growth was particularly weak in relation to GDP growth in 2015 in emerging market and developing economies (Figure 1.13, panel 3). Box 1.1 explores in more detail the weakness in trade. The discussion earlier in this section suggests that the slowdown and rebalancing in China plays an important role in explaining these trends, given China’s large share of global trade (more than 10 percent) and especially global investment (about 25 percent). Indeed, China’s import growth declined by about 4 percentage points and its investment growth by about 2 percentage points between 2014 and 2015. But declining investment and imports in some commodity exporters also played a major role. Brazil, Russia, and a small group of other commodity\u0002exporting countries facing macroeconomic difficulties, altogether accounting for about 5 percent of global trade and investment in 2014, experienced dramatic contractions in investment during 2015 of close to 20 percent and commensurate declines in imports. These developments reflect, in addition to the weakness in commodity-related investment, the significant exchange rate depreciation in many of these countries and the impact of sanctions in Russia, as well as the high sensitivity of capital spending and imports to aggregate demand during periods of economic tur\u0002moil. For the remaining emerging market and devel\u0002oping economies, the decline in trade and investment growth was more muted and broadly in line with the slowdown in aggregate economic activity (Figure 1.13, panel 4). Global Implications of Lower Oil Prices Scenarios outlining the global impact of a supply\u0002driven oil price decline presented in the April 2015 WEO indicate that a positive oil supply shock should 4Indeed, the correlation between the two series over the past two decades is close to 0.9 for the various country groupings. ©International Monetary Fund.

The disappointing performance of the global economy over the past year has led some observers to question whether an oil price decline is truly “a shot in the arm” for world growth. Part of the explanation is that demand shocks have slowed global economic activity, while also contributing to the decline in oil prices.

Emerging Market and Developing Economies, Excluding China and Selected Commodity Exporters1 Source: IMF staff calculations. 1Selected commodity exporters = Angola, Bahrain, Belarus, Brazil, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela. After bouncing back following the global financial crisis, global trade and investment have slowed notably, both in absolute terms and in relation to world GDP growth. This slowdown has been more pronounced in emerging market and developing economies. The slowdown and rebalancing in China play an important role in explaining these trends, but so do declining investment and imports in some commodity exporters facing macroeconomic difficulties. For the remainder of emerging market and developing economies, the decline in trade and investment growth is more muted. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 14 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 supply-driven oil price decline—especially for the most recent period. The first—and arguably the most important—of these factors concerns the ability of oil-exporting countries to smooth the negative shock, reducing expenditure by less than the amount of the loss in oil revenues. Expectations that oil prices may stay low for a protracted period of time reinforce pressures on oil-exporting countries to adjust spending downward. Furthermore, with oil prices already much lower when the latest decline started in the second half of 2015, a number of oil-exporting countries find themselves in much more difficult macroeconomic situations and with much tighter external financing conditions, circumstances that limit their ability to avoid sharp expenditure cuts. Indeed, downward revisions to domestic demand in fuel-exporting emerging market and developing economies have been sizable: the level of demand in 2015 was some 9 percentage points lower than in the April 2014 WEO forecasts, with the difference now expected to widen to 15 percentage points in 2016. A second factor is the limited extent to which oil importers’ private consumption levels have risen in response to their higher disposable incomes. While private consumption growth has picked up in most oil-importing advanced economies, it has done so less strongly than previous episodes of oil price declines would have suggested, possibly owing to continued deleveraging in some of these economies. For some oil-importing emerging market economies, the expansionary effects of lower oil prices have also been dampened by a low pass-through of global spot oil price changes to retail prices, owing to a con\u0002comitant reduction in subsidies in some cases and increased taxation, higher profit margins for refiners or distributors, or the use of forward contracts in others. A third factor is the impact of oil price declines on capital expenditure. Even in countries that are commodity importers, the sharp decline in cap\u0002ital expenditure in the energy and mining sector worldwide has taken a toll on aggregate investment. This impact may in part reflect the fact that, at least in some advanced economies, such as the United States, firms operating in the energy sector were increasing leverage (with outlays exceeding cash flow) prior to the price decline. The redistribution of resources away from these firms—and the asso\u0002ciated tightening of their access to credit––has led them to cut spending substantially and thereby exert a drag on aggregate demand. A fourth factor is that falling oil prices coincide with a period of slow economic growth characterized by exceptionally low inflation and policy interest rates in oil-importing advanced economies. Hence, major central banks have little or no capacity to lower their policy interest rates further to support growth and combat deflationary pressures, which have been exac\u0002erbated by a falling oil price. But when central banks cannot lower the policy interest rate, even a decline in inflation owing to the positive supply effect of lower production costs raises the real rate of interest, with negative effects on demand. The analysis presented in Scenario Box 1 pulls some of these threads together. In the scenario, the oil price decline reflects mostly higher oil supply, but also weaker global demand (consistent with weaker actual and expected global growth since the initial decline in prices in the second half of 2014) and a trend increase in energy efficiency. In addition, the scenario assumes an increase in financial distress in fuel exporters as oil prices decline, which raises their external borrowing costs. The Forecast Policy Assumptions After a period of consolidation, fiscal policy is projected to be neutral in advanced economies as a whole in 2016—somewhat expansionary in some countries, such as Canada, Germany, Italy, and the United States, and somewhat contractionary in Japan, Spain, and the United Kingdom (Figure 1.14). The projected neutral policy stance in emerging markets masks a substantial diversity across countries and regions but for the group as a whole is tighter than projected in the October 2015 WEO, to an import\u0002ant extent reflecting the sharper fiscal adjustment planned in oil-exporting countries (see the April 2016 Fiscal Monitor). Turning to monetary policy, the forecast is based on the assumption that the policy interest rate in the United States increases gradually but steadily (Figure 1.6). Short-term interest rates stay negative in the euro area through part of 2017 and close to zero (in effec\u0002tive terms) in Japan through 2018. Monetary policy stances across emerging market economies remain divergent, reflecting the variety in circumstances. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 15 CHAPTER 1 Reent evelop International Monetary Fund | April 2016 This scenario uses the IMF’s G20 Model (G20MOD) to estimate the net macroeconomic impact of the decline in oil prices since 2014 based on estimates of the three components underlying that decline: higher oil supply, expectations of weaker global demand independent of oil prices, and improved energy efficiency. The latter two factors imply lower demand for oil. The model-based estimates indicate that the decline in oil prices associated with higher oil supply has a positive impact on global GDP. However, this positive impact is more than offset by the weakness in global economic activity, which underpins the demand-driven component of the oil price decline. Factors Driving the Decline in Oil Prices Oil prices fell by roughly 50 percent in 2015 relative to 2014 (in annual average terms). Prices in futures markets suggest a further 10 percent average decline in 2016 and only a very gradual recovery afterward. As detailed by Arezki, Toscani, and van der Ploeg (forthcoming) and shown in Scenario Figure 1, the decline in current and expected oil prices relative to the path expected at the time of the April 2014 WEO can be decomposed into three key factors: increases in oil supply, weaker global demand, and improved energy efficiency. This decomposition is done using historical and forecast data on oil supply from the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) World Energy Outlook and the oil model described by Benes and others (2015). As Scenario Figure 1 shows, higher oil supply is estimated to account for almost all the decline in oil prices in 2015 and the major, but dimin\u0002ishing, share in the decline in oil prices that futures markets suggest will persist for an extended period (blue-shaded area). Weaker actual and expected global demand, while accounting for very little of the decline in 2015, accounts for a growing share thereafter (red\u0002shaded area). Improved energy efficiency is projected to account for a small, but increasing, share of the decline from 2016 onward (yellow-shaded area). Estimating the Net Global Impact To estimate the net impact of the decline in oil prices on global GDP, these three factors are combined in their respective proportions in G20MOD. In addition, the scenario also estimates the potential impact of the fiscal pressures and financial market stress that lower oil prices have caused in key oil-exporting countries and regions. The scenario presented in Scenario Figure 2 thus includes four layers: higher oil supply; weaker global demand; improved energy efficiency; and increased fiscal and financial stress in key oil-exporting countries. Higher Oil Supply The first layer (blue line in the figure) is the mar\u0002ginal impact of the reduction in oil prices driven solely by increases in the global supply of oil. This increase in supply reduces oil prices by roughly 50 percent in 2015 and 2016, and then gradually moderates, so that by 2021 oil prices are about 30 percent below the price expected in 2014. This decline in oil prices, driven by the supply increase, has a positive impact on global GDP that peaks at about 1 percent in 2016 and 2017 before it gradually moderates to about ¾ percent by 2021 as oil prices recover. Advanced economies, which are less dependent on oil exports, benefit the most, with a sustained improvement in GDP of more than 1 percent. Emerging market economies as a group, where more oil production is concentrated, benefit in the near term, but their combined GDP 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 2015 16 17 18 19 20 Source: IMF staff calculations.

Not for Redistribution 16 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 returns to baseline by 2021 as the adjustment to the reduction in oil sector revenue is completed. Weaker Global Demand The second layer (red line) adds the decline in global aggregate demand that is required to account for the estimated share of the fall in oil prices pre\u0002sented in the decomposition in Figure 1. That is, this layer captures the weakness in global GDP growth that is independent of oil prices. Consistent with the evolution of WEO forecasts since 2014, the weaken\u0002ing in global demand is more heavily concentrated in emerging markets. The addition of the weakening in global demand results in global GDP that is now almost 3 percent below baseline by 2021. Hence adding the demand layer more than offsets the positive impact on advanced economies’ GDP coming from the supply-induced decline in oil prices. For emerging market economies, output is well below baseline after the demand component is added. Improved Energy Efficiency The third layer (yellow line) adds the forecast improvement in energy efficiency, which is essentially a decline in the demand for oil that is independent of global GDP growth, leading to lower oil prices. This efficiency-related decline in the price of oil has a small positive impact on global GDP, with the benefits accruing largely to advanced economies. Additional Stress in Key Oil-Exporting Countries The final layer (green line) adds the additional fiscal and financial stress in key oil-exporting countries that could arise from the collapse in their oil export revenues. Although fiscal policy in oil-exporting countries adjusts endogenously to the worsening in revenue, the adjust\u0002ment in the baseline version of the model takes place via reduced transfers to households, and these measures do not have large multiplier effects. However, given the mag\u0002nitude of the fiscal adjustment in countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other oil-exporting countries, public expenditure may also need to bear some of the burden. Hence it is assumed that public consumption and invest\u0002ment also need to be cut to maintain fiscal sustainability. In addition, it is assumed that risk premiums rise in a number of oil exporters with lower net external assets, by 100 basis points in 2016 and 2017. The result is a further reduction in global GDP of roughly ¼ percent, concen\u0002trated in emerging market economies. –0.5 –0.4 –0.3 –0.2 –0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 2014 16 18 20 21 2014 16 18 20 21 6.

Not for Redistribution 17 CHAPTER 1 RECENT DEvELOpMENTs aND pROspECTs International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Other Assumptions Global financial conditions are assumed to remain broadly accommodative, but with some segments— notably commodities and related industries and oil- exporting countries—facing tighter financing con\u0002ditions. The process of monetary policy normalization in the United States is assumed to proceed smoothly, without sharp movements in long-term interest rates. The tightening of financial conditions for some emerging market economies over the past few months, with rising interest rate spreads and declining equity prices, is expected to persist. Oil prices are projected to increase gradually over the forecast horizon, from an average of about $35 a barrel in 2016 to $41 a barrel in 2017. In contrast, nonfuel commodity prices are expected to stabilize around recent levels. Geopolitical tensions are assumed to stay elevated in 2016, with the situation in Russia and Ukraine remaining difficult and strife continuing in some countries in the Middle East. These tensions are generally assumed to ease, allowing for a gradual recovery in the most severely affected economies in 2017 and beyond. Global Outlook for 2016 and 2017 Global output is estimated to have grown by 3.1 percent in 2015, with 1.9 percent growth for advanced economies and 4.0 percent growth for emerging market and developing economies. Global growth is projected to remain modest in 2016, at 3.2 percent, before picking up to 3.5 percent in 2017 (Table 1.1). Emerging market and developing economies will still account for the lion’s share of world growth in 2016, yet their growth rate is projected to increase only modestly relative to 2015, remaining 2 percent\u0002age points below the average of the past decade. This growth projection reflects a combination of factors: weakness in oil-exporting countries; a moderate slow\u0002down in China (0.4 percentage point), where growth continues to shift away from manufacturing and investment; and a still-weak outlook for exporters of non-oil commodities, including in Latin America, fol\u0002lowing further price declines. Oil-importing emerging market economies are benefiting from terms-of-trade gains but in some instances are facing tighter financing conditions and weakness in external demand, which counter the positive terms-of-trade impact on domes\u0002tic demand and growth. The modest acceleration of growth in advanced economies to a large extent reflects support from lower energy prices (Figure 1.3) and Source: IMF staff estimates. 1 Data through 2000 exclude the United States. 2 Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States. 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 1950 60 70 80 90 2000 10 21 3.

The projected broadly neutral fiscal policy stance inemerging market economies masks a substantial diversity across countries and regions. Figure 1.14.

The projected pickup in growth in 2017, in turn, reflects stronger performance in emerging mar\u0002ket economies. In particular, growth in countries experiencing severe macroeconomic conditions in 2015–16 (including Brazil, Russia, and some countries in Latin America and in the Middle East), while remaining weak or negative, is projected to rise, with a return to positive growth in both Latin America and the CIS and a sizable pickup in growth in sub-Saharan Africa. These developments more than offset the projected continuation of the slow\u0002down in China. Among advanced economies, growth is again pro\u0002jected to increase marginally, as the projected decline in growth in Japan due to the planned consumption tax increase is more than offset by slightly stronger performance in most other advanced economies. The outlook is weaker than that in the January 2016 WEO Update for both advanced economies and emerging markets. Relative to the October 2015 WEO, global growth has been revised downward by 0.4 percentage point in 2016 and 0.3 percentage point in 2017. Global Outlook for the Medium Term Global growth is projected to increase further beyond 2017, to just below 4 percent by the end of the forecast horizon in 2021, reflecting a further pickup in growth in emerging market and develop\u0002ing economies. This outcome relies on a number of important assumptions, which—as discussed in the fol\u0002lowing section—are subject to sizable downside risks: • A gradual normalization of conditions in several economies currently under stress • A successful rebalancing of China’s economy, with trend growth rates that––while lower than those of the past two decades––remain high • A pickup in activity in commodity exporters, albeit with growth rates more modest than in the past • Resilient growth in other emerging market and developing economies In this context, the gradual increase in the global weight of fast-growing countries such as China and India also plays a role in boosting global growth. Growth in advanced economies is projected to remain at about 2 percent as output gaps close and then slow owing to diminished growth in the labor force as pop\u0002ulations continue to age. Economic Outlook for Individual Countries and Regions • Growth is projected to continue in the United States at a moderate pace, supported by strengthening balance sheets, no further fiscal drag in 2016, and an improving housing market. These forces are expected to offset the drag to net exports coming from the strengthening of the dollar and slower growth in trading partners, the additional decline in energy investment, weaker manufacturing, and tighter domestic financial conditions for some sectors of the economy (for example, oil and gas and related industries). As a result, growth is projected to level off at 2.4 percent in 2016, with a modest uptick in 2017. Longer-term growth prospects are weaker, with potential growth estimated to be only about 2 percent, weighed down by an aging popula\u0002tion and low total factor productivity growth. • The modest euro area recovery is projected to con\u0002tinue in 2016–17, with weakening external demand outweighed by the favorable effects of lower energy prices, a modest fiscal expansion, and supportive financial conditions. Potential growth is expected to remain weak, as a result of crisis legacies (high pri\u0002vate and public debt, low investment, and eroding skills due to high long-term unemployment), aging effects, and slow total factor productivity growth. Output in the euro area is expected to grow at about 1.5 percent in 2016 and 1.6 percent in 2017 and remain around 1.5 percent in the medium term. Growth is expected to increase modestly in Germany (to 1.6 percent by 2017), France (to 1.1 percent in 2016 and 1.3 percent in 2017), and Italy (to 1 percent in 2016 and 1.1 percent in 2017). Growth in Spain is projected to soften (to 2.6 percent in 2016 and 2.3 percent in 2017) while remaining above the euro area average. Activity is expected to decelerate in Portugal (to 1.4 percent in 2016 and 1.3 percent in 2017), while Greece is expected to return to growth in 2017 after contracting further this year. • In Japan, growth is projected to remain at 0.5 percent in 2016, before turning slightly negative to –0.1 percent in 2017 as the scheduled increase in the consumption tax rate (of 2 percentage points) goes into effect. The recent appreciation of the yen and weaker demand from emerging market ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 19 CHAPTER 1 RECENT DEvELOpMENTs aND pROspECTs International Monetary Fund | April 2016 economies are projected to restrain activity during the first half of 2016, but lower energy prices and fiscal measures adopted through the supplemen\u0002tary budget are expected to boost growth (with fiscal stimulus alone adding 0.5 percentage point to output). The Bank of Japan’s quantitative and qualitative easing measures—including negative interest rates on marginal excess reserve deposits adopted in February—are expected to support private demand. Japan’s medium- to long-term growth prospects remain weak, primarily reflecting a declining labor force. • The picture for other advanced economies is more mixed, reflecting in part uneven effects from lower commodity prices, as well as different degrees of spillovers from the economic rebalancing in China. o In the United Kingdom, growth (forecast at 1.9 percent in 2016 and 2.2 percent in 2017) is expected to be driven by domestic private demand supported by lower energy prices and a buoyant property market, which help to offset headwinds from fiscal consolidation and height\u0002ened uncertainty ahead of the June referendum on European Union membership. o Strong growth projected for Sweden (about 3.7 percent in 2016, easing to 2.8 percent in 2017) is underpinned by expansionary monetary policy, higher residential investment in response to rising house prices, and higher public spending owing to large refugee inflows. o In Switzerland, growth is expected to increase modestly to 1.2 percent in 2016 and 1.5 percent in 2017, as the drag from last year’s exchange rate appreciation wanes. o Commodity-exporting advanced economies continue to adjust to reduced income and resource-related investment. In Norway, GDP growth is projected to soften to 1.0 percent this year as the decline in oil prices weighs on invest\u0002ment and consumption and to recover gradually afterward. In Canada, growth is expected to recover to 1.5 percent in 2016, with the drag from the energy sector offset partially by a more competitive currency and an expected increase in public investment, before it accelerates to 1.9 percent in 2017. In Australia, growth is expected to remain below potential at 2.5 percent in 2016 but to rise above potential to 3 percent over the next two years, supported in part by a more com\u0002petitive currency. o Among other advanced economies in Asia, the downturn in China’s imports in 2015 has been an important drag. In 2016, growth will soften in Singapore (to 1.8 percent) and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (to 2.2 percent) and pick up modestly in Korea (to 2.7 percent) and more noticeably in Taiwan Province of China (to 1.5 percent, after the sharp drop to 0.7 percent in 2015). Growth in all four of these economies is expected to pick up more robustly from 2017 onward, as China’s import demand recovers. Pop\u0002ulation aging is increasingly weighing on potential growth in these economies, most notably in Korea and Singapore. • Growth in China is projected to slow to 6.5 percent this year and 6.2 percent in 2017, slightly higher than the projections in the October 2015 WEO, reflecting announced policy stimulus. A further weakening is expected in the industrial sector, as excess capacity continues to unwind, especially in real estate and related upstream industries, as well as in manufacturing. Services sector growth should be robust as the economy continues to rebalance from investment to consumption. High income growth, a robust labor market, and structural reforms designed to support consumption are assumed to keep the rebalancing process on track over the forecast horizon. • Elsewhere in emerging and developing Asia, activity remains robust. In India, growth is projected to notch up to 7.5 percent in 2016–17, as forecast in October. Growth will continue to be driven by private consumption, which has benefited from lower energy prices and higher real incomes. With the revival of sentiment and pickup in industrial activity, a recovery of private investment is expected to further strengthen growth. Among the ASEAN-5 economies (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thai\u0002land, Vietnam), growth will ease in 2016 in Malay\u0002sia and Vietnam (to 4.4 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively) but increase moderately in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand (to 4.9 percent, 6.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, respectively). Growth in the ASEAN-5 is envisaged to pick up further in 2017 and thereafter, underpinned by strong domes\u0002tic demand and a gradual increase in exports. • In Latin America and the Caribbean, overall growth in 2016 is expected to be negative for a second consecutive year (at –0.5 percent). However, across all countries in the region, economic activity is ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 20 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 expected to strengthen in 2017, with growth picking up to 1.5 percent. There are substantial differences across regions and countries. While South America remains heavily affected by the decline in commod\u0002ity prices, Mexico, Central America, and the Carib\u0002bean are beneficiaries of the U.S. recovery and, in most cases, lower oil prices. Indeed, most countries in the region continue to grow, even if modestly. o Mexico is expected to continue to grow at a moderate pace (2.4 percent in 2016 and 2.6 percent in 2017), supported by healthy private domestic demand and spillovers from a robust U.S. economy. o In Brazil, output is expected to contract by a further 3.8 percent in 2016 (following a con\u0002traction of 3.8 percent in 2015), as the recession takes its toll on employment and real incomes and domestic uncertainties continue to constrain the government’s ability to formulate and execute policies. With many of the large shocks from 2015–16 expected to have run their course, and helped by a weaker currency, growth is projected to turn positive during 2017; nevertheless, output on average will likely remain unchanged from the previous year. These forecasts are subject to large uncertainty. o Among oil-exporting South American countries, the projected deceleration of activity in Colombia (with growth easing to 2.5 percent in 2016 from 3.1 percent in 2015) reflects low oil prices, as well as tightening macroeconomic policies and financial conditions. Venezuela is projected to remain in a deep recession in 2016 (with out\u0002put projected to contract by 8 percent following the contraction of 5.7 percent in 2015), amid political uncertainty and as the renewed decline in the price of oil has deepened existing macro\u0002economic imbalances and pressures, including an average inflation rate projected to rise to close to 500 percent in 2016. Ecuador’s outlook is highly uncertain and depends on the availability of external financing. Under the baseline scenario, the country’s output is expected to contract this year (by 4.5 percent) amid lower oil prices, a loss of competitiveness on the back of an appreciating dollar, fiscal consolidation, and tight financing conditions. o Elsewhere in South America, the ongoing push to correct macroeconomic imbalances and microeco\u0002nomic distortions in Argentina has improved pros\u0002pects for growth over the medium term, but the adjustment is likely to generate a mild recession in 2016. The protracted decline in the price of copper and tighter financial conditions are weigh\u0002ing on Chile’s outlook (with growth declining to 1.5 percent in 2016 from 2.1 percent in 2015). Peru’s growth is expected to pick up in 2016 and 2017 (to 3.7 and 4.1 percent, respectively), mostly driven by stronger activity in the resource sector. • The economic outlook for the Commonwealth of Independent States remains very weak, reflecting the recession in Russia and its regional spillovers, as well as the effect of lower oil prices on oil-exporting countries. Output in the region is projected to decline further by 1.1 percent in 2016. A recovery is expected to take hold in 2017, with growth fore\u0002cast at 1.3 percent. In Russia, growth is projected at –1.8 percent in 2016 (following a contraction of 3.7 percent last year), as international sanctions compound the effects of lower oil prices and struc\u0002tural weaknesses. Ukraine’s economy is projected to return to positive growth in 2016, supported by improving consumer and investor confidence, gradually rising real incomes, and a gradual easing of credit conditions. The sustained decline in oil prices, Russia’s recession, and the slowdown and rebalancing of China’s economy are weighing on growth in the Central Asia and Caucasus region by suppressing exports, remittances, and investment. The region’s growth forecast has been downgraded to 1.2 percent in 2016, reflecting weak external demand, lower oil production, and weak confidence in Kazakhstan, weaker public investment in Azer\u0002baijan and Turkmenistan, and lower remittances in the oil- importing countries. Growth is expected to recover only modestly to 2.5 percent in 2017. • Growth in emerging and developing Europe is projected to remain broadly stable at 3.5 percent in 2016 and 3.3 percent in 2017. Activity in the region has benefited from lower oil prices and the gradual recovery in the euro area, but elevated corporate debt is hindering private investment. In Turkey, growth is projected to remain stable at 3.8 percent in 2016, with a large minimum wage increase sustaining domestic demand in the face of geopolitical uncertainty, weak external demand, and slowing credit growth. Growth is expected to mod\u0002erate in Hungary as the effects of the high absorp\u0002tion of European Union funds gradually dissipate, but to pick up slightly in southeastern Europe. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 21 CHAPTER 1 RECENT DEvELOpMENTs aND pROspECTs International Monetary Fund | April 2016 • Growth in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to remain weak this year at 3.0 percent, about ½ percentage point lower than in 2015, and 1.3 percentage points lower than forecast in the October 2015 WEO. Growth is projected to pick up to 4.0 percent in 2017, helped by a small rebound in commod\u0002ity prices and timely policy implementation. The ongoing slowdown is primarily driven by unfavor\u0002able external conditions: resource-intensive countries have suffered from the decline in commodity prices, while the region’s frontier markets are adversely affected by tighter global financing conditions. o Sub-Saharan Africa’s oil-exporting countries are now projected to grow at 2.0 percent in 2016 (a downward revision of 2.1 percentage points relative to the October 2015 forecast) and 3.4 percent in 2017. Within this group, growth in 2016 is expected to ease to 2.5 percent in Angola (down from 3.0 percent in 2015) and 2.3 percent in Nigeria (from 2.7 percent growth last year), as the negative impact of lower oil prices is com\u0002pounded by disruptions to private sector activity through exchange rate restrictions. o The effect of the decline in oil prices on the region’s oil-importing countries has been smaller than expected, as many of these economies export other nonrenewable resources whose prices have also dropped. In South Africa, growth is expected to be halved to 0.6 percent in 2016 owing to lower export prices, elevated policy uncer\u0002tainty, and tighter monetary and fiscal policy. In Zambia, the impact of the drought on electric\u0002ity production is adding to downward pressure from low copper prices, and growth will remain subdued at 3.4 percent (slightly below the 3.6 percent achieved in 2015). In Ghana, growth is projected to increase in 2016 to 4.5 percent, from 3.5 percent last year, when it was hampered by power shortages and fiscal consolidation. In many other oil importers, inflationary pressures stemming from the pass-through of a strong U.S. dollar (which notably limited the decline of fuel prices in domestic-currency terms) and high food prices (due to the drought in eastern and south\u0002ern Africa) have also offset to some extent the benefits of lower oil prices. Nonetheless, ongoing investment in infrastructure and strong consump\u0002tion in countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, and Tanzania are expected to drive growth at rates of 6–7 percent or more this year and next. By contrast, Ethiopia’s economy is held back by a drought, with growth projected to decline substantially to 4.5 percent (from 10.2 percent in 2015). • The outlook across the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP) region has weakened considerably because of further declines in oil prices and intensifying conflicts and security risks. Growth in the region overall is projected at 3.1 per\u0002cent in 2016 and 3.5 percent in 2017, 0.8 percentage point and 0.7 percentage point weaker, respectively, than projected in the October 2015 WEO. o With oil prices now expected to remain low for longer, oil-exporting MENAP countries have taken substantial further steps to restrain govern\u0002ment spending, cut subsidies, and raise revenues. Even with these measures, fiscal deficits are pro\u0002jected to widen this year. Growth in the member countries of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) is now expected to decline from 3.3 percent in 2015 to 1.8 percent in 2016 and pick up to more than 2 percent over the medium term. However, increased oil production in the postsanctions Islamic Republic of Iran and in Iraq, as well as the bottoming out of activity in Yemen as the conflict is assumed to ease gradually, is projected to raise the aggregate growth rate of oil-exporting MENAP countries to 2.9 percent in 2016 and 3.1 percent in 2017 from 1.9 percent last year. o Growth in oil-importing MENAP countries is expected to remain subdued as gains from greater political stability, economic reforms, reduced drag from fiscal consolidation, and lower oil prices are offset by spillovers from security disruptions, social tensions, and spillovers from regional con\u0002flicts, and, more recently, slowdowns in member countries of the GCC. Global Inflation With the December 2015 declines in oil prices mostly expected to persist this year, consumer price inflation has been revised downward across almost all advanced economies and is projected to remain below central bank targets in 2016. Excluding Venezuela (where average inflation is projected to rise to close to 500 percent this year and even further next year), infla\u0002tion in emerging market and developing economies is projected to fall to 4.5 percent in 2016, from 4.7 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 22 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 percent in 2015, reflecting the decline in commodity prices and the dissipating effects of last year’s currency depreciations. • In the euro area, headline inflation is projected to reach 0.4 percent in 2016 (from about zero in 2015) and to increase further to 1.1 percent in 2017 with support from monetary policy easing by the ECB. Inflation is thereafter expected to rise only very gradually over the medium term. • In Japan, inflation is expected to be negative at –0.2 percent in 2016 because of lower energy prices and the strengthening of the yen in recent months. Over the medium term, inflation is projected to rise to 1.0–1.5 percent, as accommodative monetary policy conditions and the closing of the output gap apply upward pressure on prices. • In the United States, inflation in 2016 is projected to rise to 0.8 percent from 0.1 percent in 2015 amid a tightening labor market, even though dollar appreciation and pass-through from lower oil prices are exerting downward pressure on prices. Consumer price index inflation is projected to rise over the medium term to about 2¼ percent, with inflation measured with the personal consumption expenditure deflator—the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure—reaching 2 percent. • Average inflation in other advanced economies will also remain below central bank targets, mostly as a result of the decline in oil prices. Inflation is pro\u0002jected to return to target next year in Korea (partly because the Bank of Korea recently reduced its inflation target), but only over the medium term in Singapore and Sweden. Consumer prices in Swit\u0002zerland are projected to decline in 2016 and 2017 given the appreciation of the currency last year. In emerging market economies, the downward pressure from lower oil prices is offset to varying degrees by the pass-through of nominal exchange rate depreciations to domestic prices, especially in countries with strong depreciations, such as Brazil, Colombia, Russia, and more recently, Kazakhstan. In subsequent years, inflation is expected to ease gradu\u0002ally toward official targets. • In China, inflation is forecast to remain low at about 1.8 percent in 2016, reflecting lower com\u0002modity prices, the real appreciation of the renminbi, and somewhat weaker domestic demand. • In India, monetary conditions remain consistent with achieving the inflation target of 5 percent in the first half of 2017, although an unfavorable monsoon and an expected public sector wage increase pose upside risks. In Brazil, average infla\u0002tion is expected to fall slightly to 8.7 percent this year from 9.0 percent last year, as the effects of the large administered price adjustments and currency depreciation in 2015 diminish. In Russia, inflation is projected to decline from 15.5 percent in 2015 to 8.4 percent in 2016. In Turkey, inflation for 2016 is projected at 9.8 percent, almost 5 percentage points above target. • A few other emerging markets, especially in central and southeastern Europe, such as Hungary and Poland, are projected to experience headline con\u0002sumer price inflation well below target in 2016. External Sector Outlook Global trade growth is projected to remain moderate but to pick up gradually from 2016 onward, primar\u0002ily reflecting stronger growth in domestic demand in emerging market and developing economies. The main factor affecting the evolution of global current account balances in 2015 has once again been the decline in oil prices. As a result of this decline, the aggregate current account balance of oil-exporting emerging market and developing economies has turned into a deficit for the first time since 1998 (Figure 1.15, panel 1). Among oil-importing surplus regions, more than half of the $370 billion worsening of the current account balance in oil-exporting countries was offset by higher surpluses in China and other oil-importing advanced Asian economies, particularly Japan. Across oil-importing countries and regions with current account deficits, changes were roughly offsetting, with some worsening of the current account balance in the United States offset by improving current account balances in European deficit countries. And the global current account discrepancy (an apparent surplus in the world current account), which had reached $378 billion in 2014, shrank by about 40 percent in 2015. Similar factors are expected to be at play in 2016, in light of the further decline in average oil prices relative to their 2015 levels, albeit on a more modest scale. In subsequent years imbalances are forecast to narrow as China rebalances and the surpluses of advanced Euro\u0002pean economies gradually decline as a share of world GDP, more than offsetting the return to surplus of oil-exporting countries given the forecast of higher oil prices. This rebalancing notwithstanding, net external creditor and debtor positions are projected to expand ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 23 CHAPTER 1 RECENT DEvELOpMENTs aND pROspECTs International Monetary Fund | April 2016 further as a share of both domestic and global GDP, with a particularly sharp increase in the net interna\u0002tional investment position of creditor countries in advanced Europe, such as Germany and the Nether\u0002lands, reflecting projections of continued large current account surpluses (Figure 1.15, panel 2). Exchange rate movements over the past year have reflected important shifts in underlying economic fundamentals, such as changes in commodity prices, trading partners’ growth prospects, and external vulnerabilities. In particular, as shown in panel 3 of Figure 1.15 for a sample of countries without exchange rate pegs, real effective exchange rates have tended to appreciate in countries with terms-of-trade gains and depreciate in those with losses. Indeed, the mea\u0002sure of income gains and losses from terms-of-trade changes described earlier in the chapter can by itself explain more than half of the variation in real effective exchange rate movements since 2014. Growth rates in creditor countries have continued to exceed those in debtor countries (Figure 1.16), reflecting primarily strong growth in China, a pat\u0002tern that is expected to persist in 2016.5 The growth differential is mostly explained by different growth rates of domestic demand, but also by some reliance on net external demand on the part of creditors. For 2015–16, such reliance on net external demand reflects primarily developments in creditor countries that are oil exporters, where import demand has declined sharply following the collapse in oil prices. Stronger reliance on domestic demand in a number of creditor countries would help facilitate global rebalancing while sustaining world growth. A Pronounced Increase in Downside Risks WEO growth forecasts form a central, or modal, scenario—growth rates that the IMF staff estimates to be the most likely in each year of the forecast horizon. The weakening in global growth in late 2015 and the escalation of threats to global economic activity since the start of this year have led the staff to reduce the projected growth rates under the central scenario. 5Creditor countries and regions include China, advanced Asia, and creditor countries in advanced Europe (such as Germany and the Netherlands), as well as most oil-exporting countries. Debtor countries and regions include the United States, debtor nations in advanced and developing Europe (such as Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), Latin America, India and some other econo\u0002mies in emerging Asia, and Australia and New Zealand. –30 –25 –20 –15 –10 –30 –40 –20 –10 –5 0 5 10 15 20 1998 2000 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 2.

Not for Redistribution 24 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Alongside these reduced central projections, the staff views the likelihood of outcomes worse than those in the central scenario as having increased. Put differ\u0002ently, not only is the central WEO scenario now less favorable and less likely; in addition, the even weaker downside outcomes have become more likely. Heightened downside risks stem from both an intensification of the hazards highlighted in the Janu\u0002ary 2016 WEO Update and further bouts of financial turbulence leading to a tightening in financial condi\u0002tions, including in advanced economies. Over the near term, the main risks to the outlook revolve around (1) the threat of a disorderly pullback of capital flows and growing risks to financial stability in emerging market economies, (2) the international ramifications of the economic transition in China, (3) growing strains in countries that are heavily reliant on oil exports, (4) the possible impact of tighter financial conditions and bouts of financial market volatility on confidence and growth if they persist, (5) more protracted recessions in emerging market economies that are currently experiencing distress, (6) geopoliti\u0002cal risks, and (7) the United Kingdom’s potential exit from the European Union. Materialization of any of these risks could raise the likelihood of other adverse developments. Perceptions of limited policy space to respond to negative shocks, in both advanced and emerging market economies, are exacerbating concerns about these adverse scenarios. In the euro area, the persistence of low inflation and its interaction with the debt overhang is also a growing concern. Beyond the immediate juncture, the danger of secular stagnation and an entrenchment of excessively low inflation in advanced economies, as well as of lower-than-anticipated potential growth worldwide, has become more tangible. Financial Stability Risks in Emerging Markets After five years of declining economic growth and a downward shift in capital inflows that gained momentum in 2015, emerging market economies are increasingly vul\u0002nerable to a change in investor sentiment. As highlighted in Chapter 3 of the October 2015 Global Financial Stabil\u0002ity Report (GFSR), sizable currency depreciations over the past two to two and a half years have eroded the financial buffers of companies that have high dollar-denominated debt but limited claims or earnings in dollars. Fiscal buffers have also diminished; public-debt-to-GDP ratios of most emerging market economies are now noticeably above their 2007 levels (April 2016 Fiscal Monitor). The once-rapid accumulation of international reserves has given way to reserve losses in some economies. A stronger pullback of capital flows could tighten financial conditions in emerging market economies and put additional downward pressure on their cur- –4 –2 0 2 4 6 8 Creditors Debtors Figure 1.16.

The trigger for such a development could take a variety of forms: increased investor concerns about stressed emerging market economies and commodity sectors, idiosyncratic events in the larger emerging market economies, or the materialization of other risks to the outlook, such as a weakening in global demand due to protracted financial market turbulence. Regardless of the trigger, a flight from riskier asset classes could spark disruptive declines in asset prices and currency values, generating contagion effects and harming growth further. The countries that are potentially more vulnerable to a dis\u0002crete change in investor sentiment are those with larger external financing needs, weaker net international investment positions, and higher yield spreads. International Ramifications of Developments in China China’s transition to a new growth model and a more market-based economy is inherently challenging and has been bumpy at times. Corporate profitability in China has eroded over the past few years, as growth has declined toward a more sustainable pace following a period of rapid credit growth and investment. Lower corporate earnings, in turn, are hindering the ability of Chinese firms to service their debt obligations, raising banks’ levels of nonperforming loans (Chapter 1 of the April 2016 GFSR). As bank lending capacity is increasingly constrained, Chinese firms are turning to capital markets. The combination of corporate balance sheet weakness, a high level of nonperforming loans, and inefficiencies in bond and equity markets is posing risks to financial stability, complicating the authorities’ task of achieving a smooth rebalancing of the economy while reducing vulnerabilities from excess leverage. Limited progress on key reforms and increasing risks in the corporate and financial sectors have led to medium- term growth concerns, triggering turbulence in Chinese and global financial markets. Policy actions to dampen market volatility have, at times, been inef\u0002fective and poorly communicated. A sharper-than-forecast slowdown in China could have strong international spillovers through trade, commodity prices, and confidence, with attendant effects on global financial markets and currency val\u0002uations as discussed in Chapter 2 of the April 2016 Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific. That outcome could lead to a more generalized slowdown in both emerging market and advanced economies, especially if it should further compromise investment, potential growth, and expectations of future income. Risks of Further Strains in Oil-Exporting Countries With diminishing fiscal buffers, the renewed declines in oil prices in late 2015 and early 2016 could force oil-exporting countries to cut spending more sig\u0002nificantly than envisaged in the WEO forecast. Addi\u0002tional retrenchment in spending could be motivated by a tightening of global financial conditions and market perceptions of heightened sovereign risk, as discussed in Scenario Box 1. These risks would be exacerbated if oil prices were to decline even further. And in the current low-inflation environment, a scenario of even lower oil prices comes with a risk of a further reduction in inflation expecta\u0002tions and possibly also core inflation rates in advanced economies, raising real interest rates and deflation risks. At the same time, further declines in oil prices could bolster the perception that prices will stay low for long, boosting oil-importing countries’ spending out of the windfall and thereby cushioning some of these adverse effects. Recent Turbulence in Financial Markets and Losses in Equity Wealth Equity markets worldwide posted large losses in early 2016, with price declines in advanced economies especially large for banking sector stocks. From the end of December 2015 to mid-February 2016, stock price indices in advanced economies fell by more than 12 percent and those in emerging market economies by about 9 percent. Markets have since rebounded, bringing the year-to-date changes to about –2 percent for advanced economies and into positive territory for emerging market economies as of the end of March. Nevertheless, stock price indices remain well below the peaks reached in the spring of 2015, especially for emerging market economies. As discussed in the April 2016 GFSR, a lasting increase in financial market turbulence and persistent declines in equity valuations could tighten financial conditions, by increasing risk premiums and some interest rates, while reducing cap\u0002ital availability for firms, further depressing investment levels, which have yet to fully recover (Chapter 3 of the April 2015 WEO). Such asset market disruptions could also generate adverse wealth and confidence effects that harm private consumption, especially in ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 26 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 those advanced economies in which equity holdings are an important part of household wealth. Though the global equity valuation losses so far in 2016 are likely to have a very small adverse impact on consumption, the decline follows larger losses in the second half of 2015 that, if increasingly seen as persistent by house\u0002holds, would weaken consumer demand and growth in advanced economies and, ultimately, in the global economy. Weaker growth would leave the global econ\u0002omy vulnerable to further shocks and raise recession risks, feeding back into weaker investor risk appetite. Possible Delays in Normalization of Conditions in Economies in Recession The economies of Brazil and Russia, which together account for about 6 percent of world output based on purchasing-power-parity exchange rates, have been contracting since mid-2014. Lower-than-expected growth in Brazil was a major contributor to the down\u0002ward revisions to estimated 2015 growth in the Jan\u0002uary 2016 WEO Update. The baseline WEO forecast factors in a very gradual normalization of conditions in these two economies, with a somewhat reduced pace of contraction in 2016 and zero or mildly positive growth in 2017. The outlook for Brazil and Russia remains uncertain, however, and possible delays in their return to more normal conditions could once again push global growth below the current forecast. Geopolitical Tensions and Strife The incidence of armed conflicts and terrorist acts has increased in the last couple of years. Ongoing events in parts of Africa and the Middle East, as well as in Ukraine, could further heighten domestic and international tensions, with increased disruptions in trade, tourism, and financial flows. In Europe, the surge of refugees is presenting major challenges to the absorptive capacity of EU labor markets and testing political systems, fueling skepticism about economic integration, as well as EU governance, and potentially hindering policymakers’ ability to respond to both legacy and emergent economic challenges. Potential Exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union A British exit from the European Union could pose major challenges for both the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. Negotiations on postexit arrange\u0002ments would likely be protracted, resulting in an extended period of heightened uncertainty that could weigh heavily on confidence and investment, all the while increasing financial market volatility. A U.K. exit from Europe’s single market would also likely disrupt and reduce mutual trade and financial flows, curtailing key benefits from economic cooperation and integra\u0002tion, such as those resulting from economies of scale and efficient specialization. Secular Stagnation, Hysteresis, and Lower Potential Output In advanced economies, the risk of a protracted shortfall in domestic demand and a further weakening of potential output due to hysteresis effects remains a concern, especially in view of heightened risks to near\u0002term activity. In some economies, especially in vulner\u0002able euro area countries, demand remains particularly sluggish, and slack in labor markets remains sizable. The declines in the price of oil and other commodities since December 2015 raise the risk of deflation in advanced economies. The scenario presented later, in the “Policy Priorities” section, provides an illustration of how secular stagnation could affect global economic activity. A rising likelihood of lower potential output due to a protracted demand shortfall is increasingly a worry for emerging market economies as well, in particu\u0002lar for economies experiencing deep and prolonged recessions. A combination of ongoing supply-side constraints, persistently weak investment, and in some cases, high unemployment rates and skill losses could weigh on medium-term supply potential in these econ\u0002omies, especially where structural reform momentum is weak. Last but not least, economies facing domestic strife and surging refugee outflows are facing a massive loss of future economic potential. The Fan Chart: Risks around the Global GDP Forecast With a lower baseline forecast for global growth and a slightly wider confidence band around the baseline forecast, the fan chart documents a moderate but noticeable increase in the probability of global growth declining below 2 percent as compared to a year ago (Figure 1.17).6 Analysis based on the IMF’s Global 6The indicators used in the construction of the fan chart are based on prices of derivatives or on the distribution of forecasts of ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 27 CHAPTER 1 RECENT DEvELOpMENTs aND pROspECTs International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Projection Model similarly suggests an increase in the probability of a recession in major advanced economies over a four-quarter horizon relative to the probabilities computed in April and October 2015 (Figure 1.18). That increase reflects a combination of lower growth in the baseline and a negative shift in the distribution of future shocks to demand and financial variables, con\u0002sistent with adverse confidence effects given heightened perceptions of limited policy space. The simulations also suggest an increase in the risk of deflation in the euro area, Japan, and the United States for the last quarter of 2016, consistent with heightened downside risks to growth and the recent decline in oil prices. Deflation probabilities would decline in subsequent quarters if oil and other commodity prices evolve as assumed under the current WEO baseline. Policy Priorities In qualitative terms, the policy challenges currently facing most countries are similar to those highlighted in recent WEO reports. The main priorities are to lift both actual and potential output in advanced econo\u0002mies and to contain vulnerabilities and build resilience in emerging market and developing economies as they adjust to diminished growth prospects. Yet with expec\u0002tations of global growth once again scaled down and a manifest increase in the downside risks facing most economies, the urgency of policy action to safeguard near-term growth—and of planning timely policy responses should downside risks materialize—has increased further. Advanced Economies: Tackling Demand and Supply Weaknesses amid Growing Headwinds Growth in advanced economies is expected to be modest under the baseline, reflecting subdued demand and a broad-based weakening of potential growth. The main factors underlying the weakening in potential growth are population aging, which would reduce trend employment at current rates of labor market participation; sluggish investment, held back in part by weak demand and impaired balance sheets; and a weakening of total factor productivity growth the underlying variables.

Not for Redistribution 28 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 that predates the crisis (see Chapter 3 of the April 2015 WEO). Increasing headwinds from the growth slowdown in emerging market economies and the recent tightening in financial conditions are threaten\u0002ing to further weaken near-term demand in advanced economies. Securing higher and sustainable growth in advanced economies requires a three-pronged approach con\u0002sisting of mutually reinforcing (1) structural reforms, (2) continued monetary policy accommodation, and (3) fiscal support—in the form of growth-friendly fiscal policies where adjustment is needed and fiscal stimulus where space allows. In practice, fiscal space should be assessed using a risk management approach, comparing the evolution of public debt and GDP along a trajectory with no policy response, account\u0002ing for risks of a further slowdown and stagnation, with that under a forceful policy response that boosts the trajectory of output and mitigates downside risks. On the supply side, Chapter 3 documents that structural reforms—tailored to country needs—can make important contributions to potential output and employment in many advanced economies over the medium term. Yet as discussed in that chapter, certain types of structural reform can also boost demand in the short term, whereas others require supportive macroeconomic policies to accelerate their benefits and minimize their possible contractionary and deflationary short-term side effects. Comprehensive strategies that take into account both the short- and medium-term impacts are therefore needed to maximize the credibil\u0002ity of reforms and the likelihood that they will build confidence and stimulate near-term investment and consumption. Reforms that entail fiscal stimulus are the most valuable at this juncture, including those that reduce labor tax wedges and increase public spending on active labor market policies. Such measures none\u0002theless remain effective when implemented in a budget- neutral way, for example, as part of broad reforms of tax and spending policies. Product market reforms aimed at reducing anticom\u0002petitive barriers to firm entry—such as those in certain network industries, retail trade, and professional services—can rapidly buoy output by boosting invest\u0002ment and hiring as new firms expand. Nonetheless, complementary policies aimed at addressing the weak bank and corporate balance sheets that are currently inhibiting investment are key to enhancing the short\u0002term investment impact of these reforms. Other labor market reforms, including reforms of unemployment benefits and—especially—employment protection rules, boost productivity in the medium term but could be contractionary in the short term under the current weak economic conditions. These measures therefore require supportive macroeconomic policies to avoid a drag on demand and deflationary side effects. Country-specific structural reform priorities con\u0002tinue to differ to some extent. • In the United States, boosting the labor supply will require an expansion of the earned income tax 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 United States Euro area Japan Emerging Asia Latin America 5 Rest of the world Figure 1.18.

Enhanced infrastructure spending and innovation incentives are critical to fostering investment in the short term and productivity in the medium term. • In the euro area, priorities vary across countries. With persistently high youth unemployment rates in many countries, skill erosion and its effect on trend employment are palpable concerns. Lowering disincentives to employment—including the labor tax wedge—and putting in place better-targeted active labor market policies would be important to boost demand and minimize the scarring effect of long-term unemployment. Reforms of product, services, and labor markets, public administration, and insolvency regimes would help improve firms’ productivity, competitiveness, and investment prospects. Such reforms could also help expedite the disbursement of pan–European Union investment funds to support investment and innovation at the national level. At the regional level, a strong push to complete the single markets in services, capital, transport, energy, and digital technologies would promote productivity- enhancing economic integra\u0002tion. The European Union also needs a more effec\u0002tive economic governance framework—including outcome-based structural reform benchmarks, effec\u0002tive use of EU legislation, and full use of Stability and Growth Pact flexibility for structural reforms. • In Japan, structural reforms that raise productivity are vital for tackling medium-term risks and raising potential output, while income policies are needed to bolster wage-price dynamics and increase mone\u0002tary policy effectiveness. Structural reforms should focus on boosting the supply of labor (including of women), reforming labor markets to remove duality, further deregulating product and services markets, and supporting investment through corporate gover\u0002nance reform, as well as improving the provision of risk capital by the financial system. • In Europe more broadly, policy actions to support the integration of migrants into the labor force are crucial to allay concerns about social exclusion and long-term fiscal costs, while unlocking the potential long-term economic benefits of refugee inflows. Policies that can help facilitate integration include minimizing restrictions that prevent refugees from taking up work during the asylum application phase, strengthening active labor market policies specifically targeted to refugees, and providing wage subsidies to private employers that hire immigrants. Initiatives to make self-employment easier and facilitate skill recognition could also help refugees succeed. Finally, reducing restrictions on refugees’ geographical mobility, including those linked to housing, would allow them to move to locations where the probabil\u0002ity of good job matches is high. On the demand side, macroeconomic policy support can raise actual output while enhancing the benefits of structural reforms. Monetary policy should remain accommodative where output gaps are negative and inflation is too low. In addition, given the uncertain effects of product and labor market reforms on prices, and amid persistent low inflation in many countries, strong and credible monetary policy frameworks are essential. Specifically, such frameworks—including quantitative easing or negative deposit rates, where rel\u0002evant—can keep medium-term inflation expectations anchored and ease the zero-lower-bound constraint on policy interest rates, thus preempting risks that structural reforms will create deflation, increase the real interest rate, and weigh on aggregate demand in the short term. • In the United States, the mid-December increase in the federal funds rate reflected a stronger U.S. econ\u0002omy. At present, a broad range of indicators suggest a notable improvement in the labor market, accom\u0002panied by signs of firming wage and price pressures. The pace of further rate increases should therefore be gradual. An effective monetary policy communi\u0002cation strategy will remain essential, particularly in an environment of higher financial market volatility in which spillovers through financial channels could be material. • In the euro area, the ECB’s asset purchase program has supported the recovery by improving confi\u0002dence and financial conditions. But persistently low inflation and subdued growth point to the need for policy to remain accommodative for an extended period. The wide range of mutually reinforcing policy measures taken recently by the ECB are appropriate, in view of the increased downside risks to the outlook. They strengthen its forward guidance and signal a strong commit\u0002ment to meet its price stability objective over the medium term. They will also facilitate the pass\u0002through of improved bank funding conditions to the real economy by encouraging greater lending ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 30 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 while reducing the impact of negative deposit rates on bank profitability. The ECB should continue to signal strongly its willingness to use all available instruments until its price stability objective is met. These monetary policy efforts should be supported by measures to strengthen bank balance sheets, which would help improve monetary policy trans\u0002mission, bolster credit supply, and reduce banking sector vulnerabilities. Enhanced prudential over\u0002sight to provide banks with incentives to clean up balance sheets, reforms to enhance debt enforce\u0002ment regimes and insolvency frameworks, and the development of distressed debt markets (including through asset management vehicles) are priorities in this regard (see Aiyar and others 2015). • In Japan, the introduction of a negative rate on marginal reserve deposits by the Bank of Japan underscores its commitment to maintaining inflation momentum. Building on recent achievements, the authorities should consider adopting a (softly enforce\u0002able) wage growth target, supported by higher public sector and minimum wages. The central bank should also consider providing stronger guidance to markets by moving toward more forecast-oriented monetary policy communication. The latter would increase the transparency of the bank’s assessment of inflation prospects and signal its commitment to the inflation target by facilitating the communication of envisaged policy changes when inflation gets off track. In addition to an accomodative monetary policy stance, fiscal support is also essential. Fiscal policy should be growth friendly, especially in countries where fiscal consolidation is necessary. Specifically, it should support demand in the short run, protecting the most vulnerable, and increase potential output over the medium term by encouraging job creation and fostering productivity, including through innova\u0002tion (see Chapter 2 of the April 2016 Fiscal Monitor). Where public debt is high or financing conditions are unfavorable, commitments to credible medium-term consolidation plans can create policy space. Fiscal stimulus should be implemented where space is avail\u0002able and should focus on boosting future productive capacity, such as through infrastructure investment. Such a fiscal policy stance would raise demand, improve productivity, offset the short-term economic costs of some structural reforms (for example, to employment protection legislation and unemploy\u0002ment benefit systems in some euro area countries), and amplify the gains from others (for example, labor tax wedge reductions or increased spending on active labor market policies). • In the United States, the bipartisan budget agreement of December 2015 reduced immediate risks related to fiscal brinkmanship, but further fiscal efforts are needed to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term as interest rates gradually increase and the country’s demographic transition intensifies. Build\u0002ing on the 2013 and 2015 bipartisan budget arrange\u0002ments, a further agreement on a credible medium-term deficit reduction plan would provide the space to fund much-needed investments in infrastructure, raise pro\u0002ductivity and innovation, and enhance workers’ skills. • In the euro area, countries with fiscal space under the Stability and Growth Pact should do more to support demand—for example, by expanding public invest\u0002ment. Prompt and effective implementation—and possibly expansion—of the EU scheme to provide public and private investment would raise growth in the short and medium term, including through positive spillovers within the region. Expenditures necessary to absorb and integrate refugees should be considered on a case-by-case basis when assessing fis\u0002cal efforts to attain Stability and Growth Pact targets. • In Japan, a commitment to fiscal consolidation centered on a preannounced path of gradual con\u0002sumption tax hikes and a strengthening of fiscal institutions would create near-term policy space to maintain growth momentum. The importance of timely policy actions in the event of a downside scenario and their implications for global output are illustrated in Scenario Box 2. The scenario assumes that secular-stagnation forces give rise to a persistent output shortfall, with a widening of the negative output gap, but also an erosion of potential output due to persistently deficient aggregate demand. The scenario then assumes a concerted policy response relying on both demand-side and supply-side measures (a temporary fiscal expansion consisting of measures with large short-term multipliers and targeted to raise long-term potential output, accompanied by product and labor market reform commitments). This policy response can fully offset the initial negative shocks and raise output above the initial baseline. Emerging Market and Developing Economies: Managing Vulnerabilities and Bolstering Potential Output The challenges facing policymakers in emerging market and developing economies are diverse, reflect- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 31 CHAPTER 1 RECENT DEvELOpMENTs aND pROspECTs International Monetary Fund | April 2016 This scenario uses the IMF’s G20 Model (G20MOD) to illustrate the importance of policymak\u0002ers’ responding quickly to the negative self-reinforcing growth dynamics that could be unleashed should secular stagnation develop in advanced economies. The scenario also illustrates the additional benefits to Group of Twenty (G20) countries of following through on their remaining Brisbane Growth Strat\u0002egies structural reform commitments, which will further add to sustainable output. The first layer of the scenario (blue line in Scenario Figure 3) considers the implications of secular stagna\u0002tion’s appearing in advanced economies (see also the second risk scenario in the October 2014 WEO). The layer embodies lower-than-expected private investment and higher-than-expected private saving, leading to weaker domestic demand that in turn harms these economies’ supply potential. One hysteresis mecha\u0002nism is capital-embodied technology, which implies that lower investment results in slower productivity growth. In addition, overall weak demand leads to higher unemployment that results in a reduced labor supply as (1) skill depreciation generates a higher natu\u0002ral rate of unemployment and (2) discouraged workers withdraw from the labor force. Taken together, these scarring effects on productivity growth and the labor force push the path of output progressively below the baseline over time. In the second layer (red line), it is assumed that in year 2, after seeing weaker activity in the first year, many advanced economies and a few large emerging market economies launch a collective expansionary fiscal response. For illustrative purposes, the fiscal response is assumed to amount to 2 percent of GDP in the second and third years in those countries that have the fiscal space to participate. Assumptions on which advanced economies implement the coordinated fiscal response are guided by the considerations in Chapter 1 of the April 2016 Fiscal Monitor (see in particular Figure 1.6). For advanced economies as a group, this collective policy implies a fiscal impulse of roughly 1.5 percent of GDP, and for emerging market economies, about 1 percent of GDP. The fiscal response is designed both to have large short-term multipliers and to raise long-term poten\u0002tial output; it includes measures such as infrastruc\u0002ture investment, active labor market policies, and investments in research and development, as well as 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2015 17 19 21 6.

It is also assumed that monetary authorities worldwide fully accommodate the fiscal response to further amplify the benefits. In the final layer (yellow line), G20 countries are assumed to follow through on those product and labor market reforms from their Brisbane Growth Strate\u0002gies that have not yet been fully implemented. Their Brisbane Growth Strategies commitments in terms of higher infrastructure spending are already incorporated in the fiscal response. In the secular stagnation layer (blue line), global growth is roughly 0.4 percentage point below baseline, with inflation falling roughly ½ percent\u0002age point below baseline by the end of the WEO horizon. The ½-percentage-point-lower advanced economy growth has significant spillovers to emerg\u0002ing market economies, both directly through lower external demand and indirectly via commodity prices and equity prices (as emerging market equity markets are assumed to reflect some of the weakness in advanced economy equity markets). When poli\u0002cymakers respond in the second year with collective and well-targeted fiscal measures, the negative growth spiral starts to quickly reverse (red line). However, some of the scarring effects on supply are slow to dis\u0002sipate and are not fully offset by the supply-friendly measures in the fiscal response; output is therefore still below baseline at the end of the WEO horizon. However, if policymakers take advantage of the robust aggregate demand conditions when the fiscal measures are first introduced to press ahead with other product and labor market reform commitments (yellow line), then the medium-term scarring effects can be more than fully offset, and global output is above baseline by the end of the WEO horizon, with even more benefits to come beyond. Of course, an additional boost to potential output could come from the adoption of structural reforms that go beyond the commitments in the Brisbane Growth Strategies. ing the heterogeneity in circumstances and the way in which individual countries are being affected by the various realignments in the global economy. Common challenges center on dealing with slowing growth and increased vulnerabilities after a decade or so of buoy\u0002ant activity, facilitated in many cases by rapid credit expansion. Priorities range from ensuring a successful rebalancing of the Chinese economy and managing the cross-border spillovers of the slowdown in China to containing the vulnerabilities associated with tighter financial conditions and declining capital inflows as growth softens, and adjusting to lower commodity prices. Countries that are enjoying terms-of-trade gains from lower commodity prices should use the windfall to rebuild buffers. These near-term challenges notwith\u0002standing, policymakers in emerging market economies also should act to lift medium-term growth, to safeguard hard-won gains in living standards and ensure continued convergence toward advanced economy income levels. Supporting a Smooth Transition to More Balanced Growth in China As discussed in the previous sections, the slow\u0002down and rebalancing of the Chinese economy have substantial international ramifications. Even coun\u0002tries that have few direct trade linkages with China are being affected through the Chinese slowdown’s impact on prices of commodities and manufactured goods, and on global confidence and risk sentiment. Yet a well-managed rebalancing of China’s growth model would ultimately lift global growth and reduce tail risks. The international community should there\u0002fore support China’s efforts to reform and rebalance its economy. The main challenge faced by the Chinese author\u0002ities is to transit to a more consumption- and service- oriented growth model while reducing the vulnerabilities from excess leverage bequeathed by the prior investment boom. Strengthening the influence of market forces in the Chinese economy, includ\u0002ing in the foreign exchange market, is also a key objective. Further structural measures, such as social security reform, will be needed to ensure that consumption increasingly and durably takes up the baton from investment. Any further policy support to secure a gradual growth slowdown should take the form of on-budget fiscal stimulus that supports the rebal\u0002Scenario Box 2. Responding to Secular Stagnation Forces (continued) ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 33 CHAPTER 1 RECENT DEvELOpMENTs aND pROspECTs International Monetary Fund | April 2016 ancing process. Broader reforms should give market mechanisms a more decisive role in the economy and eliminate distortions, with emphasis on state enter\u0002prise reforms, ending implicit guarantees, reforms to strengthen financial regulation and supervision, and increased reliance on interest rates as an instrument of monetary policy. Good progress has been made in financial liberalization and laying the foundations for stronger local-government finances. However, the reform strategy for state-owned enterprises needs to be more ambitious. Specifically, it should provide a clearer road map to a substantially greater role for the private sector and to hard budget constraints––and at an accel\u0002erated pace. The authorities should also communicate their policies, including exchange rate policies, clearly and be willing to accept the moderately lower growth that is consistent with rebalancing. Policies to Manage Vulnerabilities As discussed in Chapter 2, emerging market economies have so far withstood the slowdown in capital flows generally well, with fewer adverse effects compared to past episodes of generalized capital flow retraction. That chapter finds that the ongo\u0002ing slowdown is tightly linked to the decline in the growth rates of emerging market economies relative to advanced economies and that swings in capital flows have tended to be smaller in countries with more flexi\u0002ble exchange rates, lower public debt levels, and higher levels of foreign exchange reserves. Although exchange rate flexibility has so far helped insulate countries’ capital inflows from global factors and their own diminishing growth prospects, policy\u0002makers need to stay vigilant in regard to the possible adverse balance sheet effects of large currency depre\u0002ciations, especially given the buildup of dollar-de\u0002nominated corporate debt in emerging markets in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Adjustments to large depreciations so far have been orderly, with little signs of systemic stress among corporate borrowers. Yet some companies’ financial buffers are likely to have diminished as a result of the large depreciations, espe\u0002cially in a context of sluggish earnings. Exchange rate flexibility should remain the first line of defense against adverse shocks in countries with floating rates, but foreign exchange intervention may become necessary when pressures become acute and signs of disorderly markets emerge. Keeping financial stability risks in check gains impor\u0002tance in an environment of reduced global risk appetite. Strong supervision and macroprudential frameworks and close monitoring of the possible vulnerabilities of both borrowers and lenders are essential. As financial condi\u0002tions tighten, policymakers face a delicate balancing act: they need to prevent a further buildup of vulnerabilities in domestic financial institutions, while taking care not to exacerbate the tightening of credit conditions in a context of subdued activity. Managing the Adjustment to Lower Commodity Prices With renewed declines in commodity prices, emerging market and developing economies that are heavily reliant on commodity exports are confronting a significant deterioration in their fiscal and external positions. Given that commodity prices are projected to stay low over an extended period, these countries will need to make sizable adjustments to domestic spending. Exchange rate flexibility will be important for cushioning the impact of adverse terms-of-trade shocks in many of these economies, although the effects of exchange rate depreciations on private and public sector balance sheets and on domestic inflation rates need to be closely monitored. In many cases, fiscal adjustments—based on a combination of spend\u0002ing cuts and revenue increases—will also be needed. Making public sector expenditures more efficient and broadening the revenue base toward noncommodity activities would make the adjustment less painful. Establishing transparent fiscal policy frameworks that provide anchors for longer-term policy objectives would bolster credibility and help keep financing conditions more favorable. The latter would allow expenditures to reflect medium- rather than short\u0002term price developments and thus help avoid excessive procyclicality during the adjustments. Oil-importing emerging market and developing economies, on the other hand, have enjoyed significant terms-of-trade windfall gains from the sharp drop in oil prices. Lower oil prices have alleviated inflation pressures and reduced external vulnerabilities. In some importing countries with oil-related subsidies, the windfall gains from lower oil prices have been used to increase public sector savings and strengthen fiscal positions. Whether all the gains should be saved depends on the extent of economic slack, the availabil\u0002ity of fiscal space, and country- specific needs. In partic\u0002ular, terms-of-trade gains may provide an opportunity to finance critical structural reforms or growth-enhanc\u0002ing spending. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 34 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Policy Requirements for Individual Emerging Market Economies • In response to the oil price collapse, policymakers in Russia will need to implement an ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation, anchored in a rules-based framework. In addition, boosting poten\u0002tial growth will require stronger governance and protection of property rights, lower administrative barriers and regulation, and greater competition and efficiency in capital allocation. • In India, lower commodity prices, a range of supply\u0002side measures, and a relatively tight monetary stance have resulted in a faster-than-expected fall in infla\u0002tion, making room for nominal interest rate cuts, but upside risks to inflation could necessitate a tightening of monetary policy. Fiscal consolidation should con\u0002tinue, underpinned by revenue reforms and further reductions in subsidies. Sustaining strong growth over the medium term will require labor market reforms and dismantling of infrastructure bottlenecks, espe\u0002cially in the power sector. • In Brazil, the government should persevere with its fiscal consolidation efforts to foster a turnaround in confidence and investment. With the scope for cutting discretionary spending severely limited, tax measures are necessary in the short term, but the most important challenge is to address rigidities and unsustainable mandates on the spending side. A reduction in inflation toward the 4.5 percent target by 2017 will require a tight monetary policy stance. Structural reforms to raise productivity and competitiveness—including the infrastructure concessions program—are essential to reinvigorate potential growth. • The steep decline in oil prices is weighing heavily on the macroeconomic outlook in Saudi Ara\u0002bia. Despite the significant fiscal consolidation in 2015, further spending restraint and revenue measures—including energy price reforms, contain\u0002ing the wage bill, prioritizing capital spending, and expanding non-oil tax revenues—will be necessary, in addition to a credible and well-communicated medium-term fiscal consolidation plan. Structural reforms to rebalance the economy toward non\u0002oil activities and the private sector are essential. Adequate buffers support the maintenance of the pegged exchange rate regime, and further fiscal consolidation will help support the regime over the long term. Policy Priorities for Low-Income Countries Economic activity in low-income countries has weakened (Box 1.2). In 2015, growth was the lowest in the past two decades, falling short of the Octo\u0002ber WEO forecast. Near-term growth expectations have also been marked down significantly. Economic weakness in advanced economies, slower growth in emerging market economies, and the sharp retreat in commodity prices are all partly responsible for the sub\u0002dued outlook for low-income countries. In addition, greater access to foreign-market financing has increased some low-income countries’ exposure to more demand\u0002ing global financial conditions. Policies must respond to the heightened challenges and vulnerabilities. As low-income countries face a similarly unfavorable external environment––lower commodity prices, lower external demand, and tighter financial conditions––many of their policy priorities are similar to those of emerging markets: • Given the subdued outlook for commodity prices, policies for commodity-exporting low-income countries will need to be recalibrated. Exchange rate flexibility has allowed many of these countries to cope better with terms-of-trade shocks; further flexibility could still help with the adjustment in some countries. However, some tightening of the macroeconomic policy stance and a strengthening of monetary policy frameworks may be also required to limit second-round effects of depreciation on inflation, which runs substantially higher than in emerg\u0002ing markets. Enhanced financial sector regulation and supervision will also be necessary to manage foreign-currency exposures in balance sheets. To preserve hard-won macroeconomic stability with commodity prices projected to remain low, there is an urgent need for more fiscal adjustment where policy buffers are running low and debt levels have already risen. To improve economic resilience over the medium term, fiscal buffers should be rebuilt as commodity prices recover, and structural reforms should be implemented to achieve economic diversi\u0002fication and higher productivity. • Low-income countries that are less resource dependent and continue to enjoy strong economic growth should focus on rebuilding eroded policy buffers. Strong macroeconomic policies and prudent debt management will also help some low-income coun\u0002tries that are exposed to global financial markets and the related volatility in capital inflows. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 35 CHAPTER 1 RECENT DEvELOpMENTs aND pROspECTs International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Low-income countries should not lose sight of the Sustainable Development Goals.7 In achieving these goals, a key priority is to create necessary fiscal space by enhancing domestic resource mobilization and improving the efficiency of government spending, while protecting the vulnerable and fostering inclusive growth. These efforts should also help alleviate the pressures on public finances that some commodity\u0002exporting low-income countries are currently facing. Deeper domestic financial markets could also increase the scope for domestic financing of the Sustainable Development Goals. More efficient public investment management can help ensure that infrastructure invest\u0002ment raises productive capacity without jeopardizing public debt sustainability. Low-income countries also need to act now to build resilience to the challenges of climate change by identifying key risks and investing in targeted infra\u0002structure and disaster management capacity. In that regard, the international community could help by providing needed financing, capacity-building support, and policy advice. Multilateral Actions to Boost Growth and Resilience In the current environment, policymakers across the globe face a particularly challenging task. With the threat of a synchronized slowdown, and an even higher salience of significant downside risks, short-term domestic macroeconomic policies need to remain sup\u0002portive of activity and confidence. Yet policy space is restricted in many economies. Despite this limitation, a more proactive multilateral approach to containing downside risks would be desirable. 7The Sustainable Development Goals, which replaced the Millen\u0002nium Development Goals in September 2015, focus on econom\u0002ically, socially, and environmentally sustainable development and include ending poverty and hunger, providing inclusive and equita\u0002ble education, ensuring access to energy and water, and promoting full employment, among others. See Fabrizio and others 2015. • Should a significant shortfall in growth threaten to push the global economy back into recession, a collective macroeconomic policy reaction would be needed. Policymakers in the larger economies should proactively identify additional policy actions that could be implemented quickly and in a concerted fashion if there are signs that global downside risks are materializing. The simulations in Scenario Box 2 emphasize the global benefits of prompt and collec\u0002tive policy action in a downside scenario. • Collective efforts are also urgently needed to enhance the global financial safety net. At a time of higher risks of financial turmoil and contagion, progress on this front would help mitigate the risks faced by commodity exporters and emerging market and developing economies that are sus\u0002ceptible to shocks despite strong medium-term fundamentals. There also remains a pressing need at the global level to complete and implement the regulatory reform agenda. In addition, advanced and emerging market economies should continue to strengthen the regulation and supervision of rapidly expanding financial activities outside the banking system. • There are solid grounds for the international community to support countries that are bearing the brunt of geopolitical or other noneconomic spillovers. The world economy lacks mechanisms to handle externalities due to such shocks—for exam\u0002ple, global epidemics and refugee flows triggered by geopolitical conflicts. Many of the affected countries are shouldering a burden for others, often with limited absorptive capacity and fiscal space. In light of the global-public-good nature of their efforts, a concerted worldwide initiative to provide support is amply justified, with those at risk from the spillovers contributing financial resources and multilateral agencies, including the IMF, assessing how they can best help channel those resources to the areas in greatest need. ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg 42 International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Commodity prices have declined since the release of the October 2015 World Economic Outlook (WEO). Diminishing growth prospects for emerging market econ\u0002omies, especially China, combined with abundant supply are putting downward pressure on the prices of most commodities, although the relative importance of each force differs across commodities. Oil prices have declined mostly on account of news about strong supply magnified by risk-off behavior in financial markets. Metal prices have fallen owing to slower demand growth from China. Food prices have also declined as the result of a record\u0002high harvest, although prices of selected food items have rebounded from unfavorable weather triggered by El Niño. This special feature includes an in-depth analysis of the energy transition in an era of low fossil fuel prices. The IMF’s Primary Commodities Price Index has declined 19 percent since August 2015, the reference period for the October WEO (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 1). Oil prices have decreased further, by 32 percent, on account of strong supply from members of the Organi\u0002zation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and risk-off behavior in financial markets, with investors moving away from what they perceive to be riskier assets, including commodities and stocks. The further collapse in oil prices has proceeded in spite of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, suggesting that market expectations are firmly anchored in “low for long” oil prices. Natu\u0002ral gas and coal prices have also declined, as the former are linked to oil prices, including through oil-indexed contract prices, albeit with a lag. Nonfuel commodity prices have weakened as well, with metal and agricultural commodities prices declining by 9 percent and 4 percent, respectively, over the period. Excess oil supply has pushed inventory levels in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop\u0002ment (OECD) to record-high levels in spite of strong oil demand. Global oil demand growth in 2015 is estimated to have been about 1.6 million barrels a day (mbd), the largest increase in five years, and significantly higher than earlier forecast by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Oil supply has been quite resilient in spite of low prices, mostly on account of strong OPEC and Russian production, as well as the Islamic Republic of Iran’s return The authors of this feature are Rabah Arezki (team leader), Chris\u0002tian Bogmans, and Akito Matsumoto, with research assistance from Rachel Yuting Fan and Vanessa Diaz Montelongo. to world oil markets. However, there have been signs of a slowdown in shale oil production in the United States recently, driven by record low oil prices since 2003. This suggests an inflection point in the relative resilience of shale oil production owing to the dramatic operational efficiency gains that have prevailed during the past year. Turmoil in financial markets, as well as a strong U.S. dollar, have also been putting downward pressure on oil prices (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 2). For the next year, world oil demand is expected to grow at the much slower pace of 1.2 mbd, according to the IEA, although the global economy is expected to grow slightly faster than in 2015. The expected slower pace is partly because the decline in oil prices has temporarily stimulated consumption of oil over the past year. Non-OPEC supply is expected to shrink for the first time in eight years, although only by a small margin. OPEC maintained its supply target at its last meeting in December 2015. In practice, however, OPEC members have been producing well above their target levels. Some OPEC countries have a strong incentive to increase production, considering the dire state of their public finances. The Islamic Republic of Iran is eager to increase production to regain market share lost during the sanctions era. At a meeting in Doha on February 16, 2016, oil ministers from Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela agreed to freeze output, and the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq subsequently welcomed the ini\u0002tiative, but without any commitment to stop or slow their scheduled production increases. A credible agreement that would significantly reduce the OPEC production target to support higher oil prices appears unlikely. Natural gas prices are also declining, with one leading natural gas price index (the average of prices in Europe, Japan, and the United States) down by 22 percent since August 2015. Falling oil prices and a relatively warm win\u0002ter as a result of El Niño have contributed to this decline. An important coal price index (the average of Australian and South African prices) has also declined 12 percent since August 2015, in tandem with oil prices. Oil futures contracts point to rising prices (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 3). Baseline assumptions for the IMF’s average petroleum spot prices, which are based on futures prices, suggest average annual prices of $34.75 a barrel in 2016—a decline of 32 percent from 2015—and $40.99 a barrel in 2017 (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 4). There remains substantial uncertainty around the baseline assumptions for oil prices. While geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could potentially cause oil market disruptions, high Special Feature: Commodity Market Developments and Forecasts, with a Focus on Special Feature Title: Special Feature Head the Energy Transition in an Era of Low Fossil Fuel Prices ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution International Monetary Fund | April 2016 43 SPECIAL FEATURE COMMODITY MARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND FORECASTS inventory levels and a rapid response from U.S. shale producers should limit the scope for a sharp price adjust\u0002ment in the near future. That said, sustained oil prices of about $30 a barrel might lead to significant price recovery farther down the road, as many relatively high-cost producers could end up halting production in response to the prolonged lower prices, and declining oil prices have already dramatically reduced investment in extraction activities (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 5). Metal prices have declined 9 percent since August 2015 (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 6). Prices have been gradually declining because of a slowdown and a shift away from commodity\u0002intensive investment in China, which consumes roughly half of global metals. Metal prices are projected to decline by 14 percent in 2016 and 1 percent in 2017. Futures prices point to continued low prices, but with rising uncertainty on account of both demand (especially from China) and stronger supply.

Food prices have decreased by 4 percent, with declines in most food items, except sugar and a few oilseeds. Sugar and palm oil prices have increased because of a drought in India and Malay\u0002sia, likely caused by El Niño. El Niño has also taken a toll on East Africa. International prices do not fully reflect the adverse weather shock, however, because of high prior inventory levels. For example, Ethiopia is suffering from its worst drought in 30 years. Unusually dry weather in North Africa is also likely to reduce harvests significantly, including those for cereals. The beverage price index has stagnated as a cocoa price increase has offset a decline in coffee prices. Annual food prices are projected to languish over the next two years owing to ample supply—supported by high levels of stocks—and slower demand. Food prices are projected to decline by 6 percent in 2016 from the previous year; current price levels are already 5 percent below 2015 levels. However, over the next two years, prices for major food products, such as wheat, corn, and soybeans, are expected to increase slightly from current levels. Risks to food prices are associated with weather variability, particularly concerns over El Niño conditions, which are expected to strengthen throughout the Northern Hemisphere and persist beyond the first quarter of 2016. The Energy Transition in an Era of Low Fossil Fuel Prices The human influence on the climate system is clear and is evident from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the climate system. —Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Fifth Assessment Report The United Nations’ 2015 Climate Change Confer\u0002ence (COP21) was by all accounts a success. Nearly all countries around the globe have now firmly committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions through the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). The post-COP21 agenda now focuses on the implementation of these INDCs. At the heart of that implementation is the so-called energy transition, which consists of moving away from using fossil fuels (petro\u0002leum products, natural gas, and coal) and toward clean energies to power the global economy. While the energy 1Samarco accounts for between 8 percent and 10 percent of iron ore production in Brazil. transition is arguably at an early stage, with important differences across countries, it is at a critical juncture. Indeed, to avoid the irreversible consequences of climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions, the energy transition must firmly take root at a time when fossil fuel prices are likely to stay low for long. It involves significant opportunities and risks, which energy policies will need to tackle. This section provides answers to four key questions about the energy transition: • Where do we stand on fossil fuels? • What is the status of clean energy? • What opportunities and risks are associated with the energy transition? • What is the way forward? Where Do We Stand on Fossil Fuels? Oil prices have dropped by more than 70 percent since June 2014 and are expected to remain low for a long time owing to a variety of factors (see Arezki and Obstfeld 2015). On the supply side, the advent and relative resil\u0002ience of shale oil production and increased oil produc\u0002tion by OPEC members play an important role. On the demand side, lower GDP growth in emerging markets has tended to reduce oil demand growth, especially in light of the secular increase in global oil efficiency (Figure 1.SF.2), and is expected to continue to do so. That said, the expansion of the middle class in emerging giants is expected to increase dramatically the demand for transport services and the level of car ownership and, in turn, to support oil demand growth (Figure 1.SF.3). The balance among these forces will determine the strength of demand growth. Natural gas and coal have similarly seen price declines that look to be long lived. The North American shale gas boom has resulted in record-low prices there. Recent discoveries of vast gas fields in developing countries add to the pool of available reserves.2 The resumption of nuclear-powered electricity generation in Japan is a permanent factor contributing to lower natural gas prices in Asia. Coal prices also are low, owing to oversupply and the scaling down of demand because of environmental concerns and slower economic activity, especially from China, which burns half of the world’s coal. The share of oil in global primary energy consumption has declined rapidly, from 50 percent in 1970 to about 30 percent today (Figure 1.SF.4). The share of coal, now 2The recent discovery of the giant Zohr gas field off the Egyptian coast and, more recently, the discovery of natural gas off the coast of Senegal will eventually have repercussions for pricing in Europe, the Mediterranean region, and western Africa. In addition, many other locales, especially in developing countries, that are opening up for resource exploration offer significant potential (see Arezki, Toscani, and van der Ploeg, forthcoming). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution International Monetary Fund | April 2016 45 SPECIAL FEATURE COMMODITY MaRKET DEvELOpMENTs aND FORECasTs reaching 30 percent of global energy consumption, has been increasing since the early 2000s, mostly on account of rising demand from China, and recently also from India. In con\u0002trast with the case of oil, more coal per unit of global GDP is now burned relative to the early 2000s (Figure 1.SF.2). Natural gas consumption has increased steadily since the 1970s, now accounting for nearly 25 percent of global pri\u0002mary energy consumption. Global demand for natural gas is projected to increase strongly over the medium term (IEA 2015), with emerging market and developing economies accounting for the bulk of the growth. Th e outlook for oil and coal demand growth falls short of that for total energy demand, partly because advanced economies are expected to drastically reduce their demand for coal and oil, in contrast with emerging markets. According to the IEA, the shares of oil and coal are expected to drop from 36 percent and 19 percent, respectively, in 2013 to 26 percent and 12 percent, respectively, in 2040. Oil is used mostly to fuel transportation, whereas coal and natural gas are used mainly as inputs into the power sector, consisting of electricity and heat generation, which accounts for more than one-third of total primary energy consumption (Table 1.SF.1). For electricity generation alone, the biggest source of energy is coal, but renewables, including hydropower, are second, followed by natural gas.3 3Th e share of natural gas in total primary energy demand is expected to rise, but it faces competition from substitutes for gas in 500 600 700 800 900 1,000 1,100 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 1980 84 88 92 96 2000 04 08 12 Oil intensity (barrels per millions of 2005 U.S. dollars of GDP) Coal intensity (tons per millions of 2005 U.S. dollars of GDP, right scale) Figure 1.SF.2.

Natural gas is expected to make further inroads into the transportation sector in particular, in which its use is still very limited. This development, Roughly equal, and substantial, amounts of energy are also consumed in the industry, transport, and building con\u0002struction sectors. The transport sector accounts for roughly two-thirds of oil use in the world. The industry, transport, and building construction sectors also consume electricity and heat that are generated by primary energy. Natural gas is the cleanest energy source among fossil fuels in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. Oil is second to natural gas in this respect, and coal is the dirtiest source, especially when used by older, low-effi\u0002ciency plants (Figure 1.SF.5, panel 1). Besides carbon dioxide, old plants tend to emit more air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. While China, the world’s largest coal consumer, is shifting toward renewable energy resources, demand from other developing countries, especially India, is expected to increase, especially if coal prices stay low (Figure 1.SF.6). In fact, global carbon intensity per unit of energy has increased since the beginning of the 1990s owing to the rising consumption of coal, especially in Asia (see Steckel, Edenhofer, and Jakob 2015). In spite of the increased use of renewables and the decreased use of oil as fuel, total greenhouse gas emissions have increased because of the increase in demand for coal (Figure 1.SF.5, panel 2). This increase has resulted from higher growth in emerging market economies, where coal intensity has risen. If the energy intensity of economic activity does not fall or if countries in the developing world do not adopt state-of-the-art technology for coal-powered plants to lower the carbon intensity of their electricity generation, along with the eventual use of liquefied natural gas as shipping fuel, will contribute to the displacement of oil. 1971 75 80 85 90 95 2000 05 10 13 Figure 1.SF.5.

Emissions will reach dramatic levels and, in turn, accelerate global warming. Poorly designed regulations for the use of coal in developing countries could also discourage technolog\u0002ical change in the electricity sector. As a result, the world might not benefit, in terms of lower global emissions, from the downward trend in coal use in developed countries. Considering its relative cleanliness and abundance, natural gas can play a key role as a bridge in the transition from coal to renewables. Growth in shale gas production in the United States is expected to make natural gas the energy of choice there. There is also potential for growth in the use of shale gas and conventional natural gas in China and many other locales around the globe (see Chakravorty, Fischer, and Hubert 2015). What Is the Status of Clean Energy? One of the most notable trends in energy consump\u0002tion is the increase in the use of renewable energy resources (Figure 1.SF.4), which has been supported by a formidable reduction in the costs of various renew\u0002ables, including solar and wind (Figure 1.SF.7, panel 1). These cost reductions are the result of research and development (R&D) efforts to promote clean energy and energy efficiency (“grey” technology) (Figure 1.SF.7, panel 2). Early R&D investment dates to the 1970s, an era of record-high fossil fuel prices, and was mostly government financed. This is no surprise, as the private sector typically does not internalize the positive external\u0002ities associated with an increase in R&D. Public R&D spending early on, however, paved the way for corpo\u0002rate R&D spending during the 2000s, another period of high fossil fuel prices. The result has been a flow of technological innovations across sectors, including the development of electric cars, although they (notably plug-in hybrid vehicles) still have a low penetration rate, accounting for less than 1 percent of car sales in the United States. Unsurprisingly, electric car sales have decreased with the recent drop in gasoline prices (Figure 1.SF.8). Among primary energy sources, renewables (including hydropower) are the least carbon intensive. The IEA fore\u0002Sources: International Energy Agency; and IMF staff calculations.

The electricity sector, in which the share of renewables is projected to increase from 22 percent to 34 percent over the same period, will be one of the sectors to change most dramatically. One potential difficulty with depending on renewable energy in the power sector is intermittency, and hence reliability. Unstable supply patterns of wind, sun, and rainfall can trigger supply-demand mismatches. The increasing reliance on renewables, including solar and wind, as sources of power generation will require much steeper ramping up of supply during daily peaks to achieve load balancing.4 In other words, the intermit\u0002tencies associated with the increased usage of renewables trigger spikes in demand for “controllable” power, for example, from natural gas (Figure 1.SF.9). For renewables to overcome this problem, the power sector needs to develop economical battery backup technology and foster 4The net load curve represents the variable portion of the load that integrated system operators must meet in real time. The net load is calculated by taking the forecast load and subtracting the forecast of electricity generation from variable generation resources, wind, and solar (see California ISO 2013). electricity exchange. Battery technology has shown steady progress, suggesting that eventually electricity storage technology will facilitate a more widespread reliance on renewables. Bioenergy has long been employed for power gen\u0002eration in the electricity sector. Biosolids are relatively cheap sources of energy, as they are residuals from other processes or simply waste. Power plants fired by biomass also have the flexibility to compensate for generation lapses associated with other renewables, as they can operate at any time of the day. Both advanced economies and developing countries are expected to develop more bioenergy-based facilities. In the transportation sector, biofuels are usually blended with conventional gasoline or diesel, sometimes following government regulation. As a result, the share of biofuels in transportation fuels has doubled over the past decade. While biofuels can reduce carbon emissions, some types also put pressure on food markets and have been blamed for food price increases (see Chakravorty and others 2015). Nuclear energy makes up only a small share of global energy consumption. Carbon emissions associated with nuclear energy generation are limited, but in the after\u0002math of the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, several countries have imposed moratoriums on nuclear energy use on account of environmental liabilities and safety Figure 1.SF.8.

In addition to human health risks, the overall impact on the environment is hard to judge, as waste management of used nuclear fuel is still at an early stage. There are also concerns about the diversion of materials involved in nuclear power generation to military use. There are, however, important benefits of nuclear energy. For example, and in contrast with renewable energy, nuclear power is not plagued by the problem of intermit\u0002tency. Also, immediate fatalities associated with nuclear power plant accidents—as opposed to long-term health consequences related to radiation and pollution expo\u0002sure—are historically much lower than for any other type of power plant, including coal-fired plants (Table 1.SF.2). The potential for using nuclear energy as a source of clean energy is relatively high. Some countries, such as China and the United States, are using more nuclear energy to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. While there are serious issues that need to be solved in terms of safety and waste management, many scientists argue that it will be hard to achieve INDC targets without greater use of nuclear energy. What Opportunities and Risks Are Associated with the Energy Transition? The current low fossil fuel price environment will certainly delay the energy transition. Indeed, progress in the development of renewables could prove fragile if fossil fuel prices remain low for long (see Arezki and Obst\u0002feld 2015).5 While renewables account for only a small share of global primary energy consumption, renewable 5Low oil prices may in part reflect, in addition to the factors discussed earlier in the chapter, an independent process of structural transformation that is taking place in China and is diminishing (or energy will need to displace fossil fuels to a much greater extent to forestall further significant climate risks. The current low prices for oil, gas, and coal may provide scant economic incentive for research to find even cheaper sub\u0002stitutes for those fuels. Lower prices have already raised demand in some countries, such as Germany, boosting the use of coal (the dirtiest fossil fuel) at the expense of natural gas (the cleanest).6 Evidence indicates that higher fossil fuel prices strongly encourage both innovation and adoption of cleaner technology (see Aghion and others 2012 and Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer 2013). For example, lower gasoline prices reduce the incentive to purchase fuel-efficient or electric cars (Figure 1.SF.8). Similarly, the number of clean- or grey-energy patents correlates positively with the price of fossil fuels (Figure 1.SF.10). Finally, low prices for energy in general may hamper the decoupling of economic growth and overall energy consumption if consumers substitute energy for other commodities. A few countries have committed to reducing coal\u0002powered generation. Because coal is currently relatively cheap, however, it is tempting for a country to use coal for power generation, especially if it cannot afford cleaner alternatives, which are typically more expensive. As mentioned earlier, even advanced economies in Europe increased their use of coal when the shale revolution in slowing down the growth of) the oil intensity of GDP (see Stefanski 2014). 6As the relative price of coal to natural gas in Europe declined in recent years, the share of coal in electricity generation increased in Germany, from 43.1 percent in 2010 to 46.3 percent in 2013. Over the same time period, the share of natural gas fell from 14.3 percent to 10.9 percent. Table 1.SF.2.

Efficiency and pollution intensity differ significantly across coal power plants. With the prospects of lower demand for coal plants over environmental concerns, power plant manufacturers that have up to this point improved plant efficiency and reduced emissions might now moderate their development efforts. This could leave emerging market economies with less efficient and more pollution-intensive coal power plants. Another key technology that can potentially salvage the coal industry in regard to its poor emissions profile is carbon capture and storage, which will be useful not only for power plants but also in other carbon-emitting industries, such as steel production. At this point, carbon capture and 7The share of coal as an input in power plants among European OECD members increased from 23.7 percent in 2010 to 26.0 percent in 2012 (with the increase in coal use largely arising from displacement of natural gas use), although the share of renewable energy increased as well. Japan increased its share of natural gas and coal significantly after it stopped nuclear power plant operations following the Fukushima accident. storage and clean coal technologies are not considered to be main global-warming mitigation tools, but it may still be important for coal and oil producers to pursue these technologies to some degree. In the long term, if and when the energy transition is successful, fossil fuels could become “stranded assets” (that is, assets that either lose value unexpectedly or prematurely or become liabilities) without proper carbon capture and storage. In the case of fossil fuel industries, stranded assets might involve “stranded reserves,” that is, fossil fuel reserves that are no longer recoverable, and “stranded or underutilized capital,” that is, sunk capital investments that would become obsolete (for example, an oil platform that will never be used). Because it remains to be seen how rapidly the energy transition might take place, however, there is significant uncertainty regarding the time horizon over which fossil fuel assets would become stranded. One important lesson from earlier energy transitions—which include the transition from wood and biomass to coal in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and the transition from coal to oil in the nineteenth and twen\u0002tieth centuries—is that these transitions take time to complete. History may not repeat itself in that regard, however, in that the technological forces unleashed by the anticipated public and private response to climate change seem much more potent than the factors driving earlier energy transitions and may lead to a relatively swifter transition this time, notwithstanding the poten\u0002tial delay implied by the current low-for-long fossil fuel price environment. Considering the industry’s carbon emissions intensity, coal-related assets are more exposed to the risk of becoming stranded than are oil and natu\u0002ral gas assets. The consequences of stranded assets would be dra\u0002matic for coal and oil companies and exporting countries that rely heavily on fossil fuel exports, which would face heavy losses. Many major oil companies have long diversified across fossil fuels by investing more heavily in the production of natural gas and have also started to invest in so-called breakthrough renewable technologies in an effort to adapt to emerging realities. Oil-exporting countries have also attempted to diversify their economies away from oil, but this has proven challenging. Neverthe\u0002less, opportunities exist. For example, the United Arab Emirates has endorsed an ambitious target to draw 24 percent of its primary energy consumption from renew\u0002able sources by 2021. Solar power concentration is highest in the Middle East and Africa and parts of Asia and the United States, according to the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Figure 1.SF.11).

What Is the Way Forward? Large economies tend to be the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Indeed, the 10 largest emitters are responsible for more than 60 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions (Table 1.SF.3). Any effort to address global warming should therefore encompass all of the largest economies (see Arezki and Matsumoto 2015). While high-income countries are big greenhouse gas emitters in per capita terms, energy efficiency has been gaining ground rapidly in these countries. Many high-income countries are reducing greenhouse gas emissions already and are committed to continue doing so. Consumption of fossil fuels by advanced econo\u0002mies can therefore be expected to continue to decrease. Though large economies account for the bulk of current emissions, emerging markets will continue to drive the growth of future emissions. In contrast to the falling emissions intensity of the advanced economies, emerg\u0002ing market and developing economies remain heavily reliant on coal, and their consumption of fossil fuels will continue to rise. There are important variations across countries in efforts to shift their energy mixes at least partly toward renewables and away from fossil fuels, especially coal and oil. Today, the European Union and Sweden, respectively, get 13 percent and more than 38 percent of their energy from renewables. Sweden in 1991 was the first country to adopt a carbon tax. Pressured by very high pollution levels, China has adopted an ambitious plan to derive a significant fraction of its future energy needs from renewables. As noted earlier, the COP21 was by all accounts a success, with nearly all countries around the globe having firmly committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions through the INDCs (Table 1.SF.4). Well before Paris, in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol aimed to achieve inter\u0002nationally coordinated reductions in carbon dioxide emis\u0002sions, but a few major countries, such as China, India, and the United States, did not agree to legally binding targets. The 2009 Copenhagen climate change conference did not yield any agreement, and real progress had to await the 2015 Paris conference. As mentioned previously, the challenge following the COP21 is, however, one of implementation. As such, setting the right incentives for achieving the INDCs is essential.

In addition to implementing mitigation efforts, countries will need to adapt to global warming, which calls for adjusting to the new reality of a warmer planet. This implies population displacements from exposed areas, or new infrastructure and housing better suited to withstand new climate risks. But adaption alone is neither fully acceptable nor sufficient, considering that global warming can cause irreversible damage. For instance, some ecosystems will be unable to adapt to rising temperatures and thus will experience substantially reduced biodiversity. Short of pervasive and economically viable carbon cap\u0002ture and storage technologies, the planet will be exposed to potentially catastrophic climate risks (see Meehl and others 2007) unless renewables become cheap enough to guaran\u0002tee that substantial fossil fuel deposits are left underground for a very long time, if not forever. The price of fossil fuels should reflect the negative externality that the consumption of the latter inflicts. The price of carbon should equal the social cost of carbon, which is the present discounted value of marginal global warming damages from burning one ton of carbon today.8 In this regard, a global carbon tax would be the most efficient way to reduce emissions. 8See D’Autume, Schubert, and Withagen 2011, Golosov and others 2014, and Rezai and van der Ploeg 2014 for useful references on the design of carbon taxes.

Global carbon pricing will have important redistributive implications, both across and within countries, and these call for gradual imple\u0002mentation, complemented by mitigating and adaptive measures that shield the most vulnerable.9 The hope is that the success of the Paris conference opens the door to future international agreement on carbon prices. Agreement on an international carbon price floor would be a good starting point in that process. Failure to address comprehensively the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, however, exposes this generation and future generations to incalculable risks (see Stern 2015).10 For developing countries in particular, aid may be nec\u0002essary to facilitate the clean technology imports necessary to ensure that these countries participate in the energy 9Farid and others (2016) discuss macro and financial policies to address climate change. 10Li, Narajabad, and Temzelides (2014) show that, even when some degree of uncertainty is accounted for, taking into account the damage from climate change can cause a significant drop in optimal energy extraction. transition.11 This aid would help offset the countries’ tran\u0002sitional costs associated with removing carbon subsidies and levying positive carbon taxes. In this vein, the Green Cli\u0002mate Fund—a fund within the framework of the United Nations—was founded as a mechanism to assist developing countries in putting in place adaptation and mitigation practices. It is intended to be the centerpiece of efforts to raise climate finance to $100 billion a year by 2020. The IMF is also supporting its members in dealing with the macroeconomic challenges of climate change.12 As noted previously, shifting away from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy resources or nuclear energy can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, shifting from coal to gas in electricity generation can help significantly in this regard. Development of the renewable energy sector will require an overhaul of the existing energy infrastructure and involve the need to train and retool the labor force. These transformations will be a source of jobs and cleaner, more sustainable growth. Indeed, the invest\u0002ment needs associated with the energy transition come at an opportune time, when interest rates are at historic lows and the world economy needs infrastructure spending both to support demand and to spur future potential growth. 11Collier and Venables (2012) discuss Africa’s needs to achieve its potential in hydro and solar power. 12See “The Managing Director’s Statement on the Role of the Fund in Addressing Climate Change” (IMF 2015b). ©International Monetary Fund.

This slowdown has been more pronounced in emerging market and developing economies, where it intensified in 2015. This box lays out some facts about the distribution of the slowdown across countries and types of products.1 In the two decades leading up to the global financial crisis, international trade expanded rapidly, at a pace roughly double that of world GDP. World trade vol\u0002ume growth, however, has moderated notably in recent years, both in its level and relative to GDP growth. As a result, the increase in trade as a share of global GDP has decelerated (Figure 1.1.1). The slowdown in trade has been remarkably widespread.

This holds true even after the weak growth in income and the decline in trade prices are taken into account. As depicted in Figure 1.1.2, most countries have been importing less, relative to their incomes during 2012–15, than in the years leading up to the global financial crisis. For 65 percent of the countries, accounting for 74 percent of global imports, the ratio of average import volume growth to GDP growth (a simple measure of the income elasticity of import demand) observed during 2012–15 was below that during 2003–06. The observed slowdown in import income elasticity has been more pronounced in emerging market and developing economies than in advanced economies. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1980–2012 2013–15 1980–2012 2013–15 Figure 1.1.1.

Not for Redistribution 55 International Monetary Fund | April 2016 CHAPTER 1 RECENT DEvELOpMENTs aND pROspECTs Most emerging market and developing economies are tightly clustered below the 45-degree line in Figure 1.1.2, while advanced economies’ experience has been more varied. A comparison of import income elasticities computed using aggregated GDP and trade data across advanced and emerging market and developing economies supports this finding. For the advanced economy aggregate, the elasticity of imports with respect to GDP fell from 2.77 during 2003–06 to 2.09 during 2012–15, while for emerging market and developing economies, import income elasticity fell more sharply—from 1.9 to 0.7—over the same period. Trade weakness was particularly noticeable in emerging and developing Asia, including China. For the region as a whole, export volumes declined slightly in 2015—a striking development in light of the region’s high income growth and historically strong trade performance relative to other regions. Which Types of Goods Are Traded Less? Documenting differences in trade volume trends across various types of goods helps explain potential drivers of the trade slowdown. For instance, partic\u0002ularly weak growth in capital goods imports may signal weak investment and an associated shift in the composition of domestic absorption as a driver of the trade slowdown. Similarly, the dynamics of intermedi\u0002ate goods imports may shed light on the behavior of global value chains. Consistent analysis of the global trade slowdown through the lens of disaggregated trade flows across a large number of countries has, however, been difficult because of limited comparable data on trade volumes and price indices by product type. This limitation is especially relevant for recent years, given the sharp relative price shifts as a result of commodity price declines. Using highly disaggregated trade data on import volume and values through 2014, Boz and Cerutti (2016) construct import volume indices for four different types of goods by end use: consumer, capital, primary intermediate, and other intermediate goods. Figures 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 plot the growth rates of these indices for selected advanced and emerging market economies.2 22015 data are available only for a small subset of countries.

As a result, the share of primary inter\u0002mediate goods imports in advanced economies’ Solution (WITS) databases. End-use categorization is based on UN Broad Economic Categories. Motor spirits and passenger cars, along with other unclassified Broad Economic Categories groupings, are excluded. Countries included in the sample are 28 advanced economies (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan Province of China, United Kingdom, United States) and 21 emerging market economies (Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Vietnam). total imports dropped from 16 percent in 2012 to 13.6 percent in 2014. This was partly driven by the increase in domestic production of oil in the United States, leading to a decline in its oil imports. • Consistent with its rebalancing process, China’s imports of consumer goods held up relatively strongly. Consumer goods, however, constituted only about 5 percent of China’s total imports as of 2014. Other intermediate goods (including parts and accessories), at 76 percent of total imports, accounted for the lion’s share. The slowdowns in nonprimary intermediate and capital goods imports were the most prominent and may have been a reflection of declines in China’s manufacturing production and investment. • Emerging markets, excluding China, varied less in regard to the behavior of imports across end-use categories. Still, imports of capital goods shrank in 2014, faring worse than the remaining categories, which continued to grow at low, but positive, rates. The weakness in emerging markets’ capital goods imports may have been partially driven by commodity exporters in this country group. A split of the sample based on whether a country was classified as a com\u0002modity exporter in Chapter 2 of the October 2015 World Economic Outlook supports this conjecture.3 More specifically, as Figure 1.1.4 shows, after a pro\u0002tracted period of robust growth in imports of capital goods before the global financial crisis, commodity exporters faced a marked decline in their capital goods imports in 2014, reflecting retrenchment in their energy sector and mining investment. These countries’ capital goods imports constituted a nonnegligible share of the world’s capital goods imports—about 15 percent in 2014. 3This classification is based on countries’ gross and net exports of commodities.

Not for Redistribution 57 International Monetary Fund | April 2016 CHAPTER 1 RECENT DEvELOpMENTs aND pROspECTs After more than a decade of growth averaging more than 6 percent, low-income developing countries saw their economic activity slow sharply in 2015. The slowdown reflects, in part, a less favorable external environment: sharply lower commodity prices, lower growth in trading partners, and tighter financing con\u0002ditions. Domestic factors and the policy environment also played a role.1 Oil-exporting low-income developing countries were hit hardest, followed by other commodity- dependent countries (Figure 1.2.1). Growth in oil exporters— which account for one-third of low-income developing countries’ aggregate output in purchasing- power-parity terms (Figure 1.2.2) and 1¼ percent of global out\u0002put—fell by half, from over 6 percent in 2014 to less than 3 percent in 2015. Growth in non-oil commod\u0002ity exporters, which account for about one-fifth of low-income developing country output, declined from 5½ percent in 2014 to 4½ percent in 2015. Coun\u0002tries that depend relatively less on commodity exports (diversified exporters, for simplicity), which account for slightly more than half of low-income developing country output, fared better, with growth still above 6 percent, although some were affected by conflicts and natural disasters (for example, Haiti, Liberia, and Nepal). Growth in 2016 is projected to be weaker than in 2015 for all three groups, although with sig\u0002nificant differences in prospects and risks within each group. A measure of the income gains and losses from the sharp fall in international commodity prices confirms that the impact on low-income developing countries’ economic prospects varied (see Gruss 2014 and IMF 2015a). Income in oil exporters fell by about 7–8 percent of GDP in 2015 (Figure 1.2.3). In contrast, low-income developing countries that are less depen\u0002dent on commodity exports saw a slight gain, in part because these countries import oil. As shown in model simulations later in this box, the decline in commodity prices in 2016 is likely to play a role in further con\u0002The authors of this box are Giovanni Melina, Futoshi Narita, Andrea Presbitero, and Felipe Zanna. 1See the October 2015 Regional Economic Outlook: Sub-Sa\u0002haran Africa and IMF 2015a.

Low-income developing countries were also affected by lower growth in their trading partners. During 2015, trading partners’ growth declined more sharply for non-oil commodity-dependent low-income devel\u0002oping countries than for other low-income developing countries—reflecting weaker growth in emerging markets (Figure 1.2.4, panel 1). In 2016, the drag from slower growth in trading partners is expected to continue for most low-income developing countries (Figure 1.2.4, panel 2). Tighter external financial conditions will also dampen low-income developing country growth.

In 2015, the number of sovereign bond issuances was almost halved compared to 2014; in 2016 that number is likely to be even lower. Some of the increase in sovereign bond spreads may reflect a weaker growth outlook, but higher spreads may mean that these countries will be less able or willing to access markets. There could be some rollover risk as well, reflecting the sizable share of nonconcessional debt in public external debt in many low-income developing countries (for example, more than one-third in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana). Histori\u0002cally, higher interest rates have tended to be associated with a lower ratio of public investment to GDP in low-income developing countries. Against this backdrop, oil-exporting low-income developing countries face considerable downside risks to their near-term growth and fiscal prospects. Model simulations reveal that unlike diversified low-income developing countries, oil exporters could, absent mitigating policies, experience growth rates lower than current baseline projections, along with rapid surges in total public debt (Figure 1.2.6, panels 1 and 2).2 For an average oil-exporting low-income developing coun\u00022This box uses the Debt, Investment, Growth and Natural Resources (DIGNAR) model developed by Melina, Yang, and Zanna (2016) and calibrated to capture aspects pertinent to oil-exporting and diversified low-income developing countries. The model is a neoclassical growth model that captures several of the transmission channels from lower commodity prices to growth, as well as the implications for fiscal adjustment and public debt. These include mechanisms related to resource allo\u0002cation, private investment and returns, private and public saving, fiscal reaction functions, and debt accumulation.

The increase in total public debt, from an average of 37 percent of GDP in 2015 to about 55 percent in 2017, reflects declines both in oil-related government revenues and in other non-oil tax revenues as a result of a diminished non-oil tax base. Moreover, in the simulations, the speed of debt buildup is intensified by depreciation of the real exchange rate, a higher sovereign risk premium, and sharp fall in oil prices.

Growth-friendly fiscal consolidation measures and additional concessional financing can help contain the debt buildup. Improved revenue mobilization, through better tax administration and a broader tax base, as well as measures such as prioritizing current expenditures and reducing subsidies on fuel products, could mitigate the effect of reduced oil-related govern\u0002ment revenues on fiscal balances. That said, historical evidence suggests that achieving sizable improvements in fiscal positions over a short period is challeng\u0002ing. Concessional financing could help address the remaining fiscal gap and contain increases in sovereign risk premiums. This would lighten the debt interest burden, although securing such financing in an envi\u0002ronment of low global growth could be very difficult. An illustrative scenario for a typical oil-exporting low-income developing country combines an increase in tax collection efficiency, which raises non-oil tax revenue by 2 percent of GDP; a decline in government current expenditures of 2.5 percent of GDP; and a cumulative increase in concessional financing of about 4 percent of GDP over the simulation horizon. This policy package slows the accumulation of public debt and stabilizes debt-to-GDP ratios over the medium term at below 45 percent (Figure 1.2.6, panel 3). 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 2014 15 16 17 18 Diversified—DIGNAR Diversified—WEO Oil exporters—DIGNAR Oil exporters—WEO 30 40 50 60 70 80 2014 15 16 17 18 Diversified Oil exporters 30 40 50 60 70 80 2014 15 16 17 18 Baseline Fiscal consolidation measures and concessional financing 1.

This chapter shows that both weaker inflows and stronger outflows have contributed to the slowdown and that much of the decline in inflows can be explained by the narrowing differential in growth prospects between emerging market and advanced economies. The chapter also highlights that the incidence of external debt crises in the ongoing episode has so far been much lower, although the slow\u0002down in net capital inflows has been comparable in breadth and size to the major slowdowns of the 1980s and 1990s. Improved policy frameworks have contrib\u0002uted greatly to this difference. Crucially, more flexible exchange rate regimes have facilitated orderly currency depreciations that have mitigated the effects of the global capital flow cycle on many emerging market econo\u0002mies. Higher levels of foreign asset holdings by emerging market economies, in particular higher levels of foreign reserves, as well as lower shares of external liabilities denominated in foreign currency (that is, less of the so-called original sin) have also been instrumental. After a peak in 2010, net nonreserve capital inflows into emerging market economies have slowed consid\u0002erably over the course of the past several years (Figure 2.1).1 The slowdown in capital flows has occurred against a backdrop of a protracted growth slowdown in emerging market economies and, more recently, the first steps toward a tightening of monetary policy in the United States. A historical perspective offers cause for concern. Capital inflow slowdowns after sustained expansions have been associated with costly economic crises and linked to turning points in monetary policy in advanced economies (Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart 1996; Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999).

Has it been broad based across regions and types of flows? How have exchange rates and the cost of capital evolved? • How does the recent slowdown compare with past slowdowns in capital flows? Has the composition of flows changed? • What is driving the recent slowdown? Can changes in emerging market growth prospects, monetary policy in advanced economies, global risk appetite, or decreasing commodity prices explain most or all of the decline? • Have policy-controlled variables, such as exchange rate flexibility, the level of reserves, and the level of debt, played a significant role? In particular, is there evidence that exchange rate flexibility has provided some insulation from the global capital flow cycle?3 2In 1980 emerging market economies accounted for 21 percent of world GDP and 27 percent of world trade, both measured in current dollars. By 2014, these shares had risen to 36 percent and 44 percent, respectively. 3A well-known theory attributed to Mundell (1963) postulates the existence of a “trilemma” in monetary policy, according to which a country, once it decides to have an open capital account, can independently pursue countercyclical monetary policies only if its exchange rate is flexible. Rey (forthcoming) argues that the insulation power of flexible exchange rates turns out to be very lim\u0002ited in practice and that only capital controls can provide effective insulation from the global financial cycle. As such, policymakers in financially open economies effectively face a dilemma between higher capital controls (which, in principle, lower the benefits of interna\u0002tional financial integration) and lower or no capital controls (which then make economies more vulnerable to the global capital flow cycle). Obstfeld (2015) provides evidence, however, that exchange rate flexibility is still instrumental in decoupling short-term interest rates in emerging markets from interest rate changes in global finan\u0002cial centers (notably the United States), thus helping provide some insulation from the global financial cycle. UNDERSTANDING THE SLOWDOWN IN CAPITAL FLOWS TO EMERGING CHAPTER 2 MARKETS ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 64 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 The analysis employs a variety of approaches, includ\u0002ing accounting decompositions, event analyses, and panel regression methodologies. The models extend the set of possible explanatory variables and data coverage to capture regularities that may be more specific to the recent slowdown. The chapter’s main findings regarding the 2010–15 slowdown in net capital inflows are as follows: • The slowdown affected three-quarters of the 45 sampled emerging market economies with available data. Both lower inflows and higher outflows con\u0002tributed to the slowdown in net inflows. Countries that had relatively flexible exchange rate regimes in 2010 experienced large currency depreciations over the period. • The current slowdown is similar in size and breadth to episodes in the 1980s and 1990s, but the contexts then and now are marked by several key differences: ## Emerging market economies in the current episode have larger holdings of external liabilities and assets, including foreign reserve assets. ## Capital outflows have become increasingly important for the dynamics of net capital inflows. ## Exchange rates are now more flexible, and domestic prices seem better anchored, per\u0002haps partly because of the widespread use of inflation-targeting regimes. • Diminished prospects for growth in emerging markets relative to advanced economies can explain most of the slowdown in total capital flows to emerging markets since 2010, while national policies affect the cross-country distribution of those flows. • In particular, flexible exchange rates appear to have helped some emerging markets mitigate the slowdown in capital flows so far by dampening the effects of global factors, as well as the effects of these economies’ own slowing growth prospects. • Swings in capital flows are also smaller in emerging markets with lower public debt, tighter capital con\u0002trols, and higher foreign exchange reserves. These findings have significant implications for both outlook and policy. On the positive side, they (1) corroborate that policy frameworks in emerging market economies have improved and (2) highlight these economies’ reduced vulnerability due to a combination of much higher central bank reserves and lessened balance sheet exposure to currency risk (that is, less of the so-called original sin). On the negative side, they point to two additional sources of risk. One is the narrowed growth differen\u0002tials relative to advanced economies; the other is the dynamics of gross outflows. The narrowed growth differentials, which appear to be connected to much weaker gross capital inflows, may not be reversed anytime soon. Their persistence reinforces the need for prudent fiscal policies (as a diminished supply of external funds raises the cost of borrowing and servic\u0002ing public debt), currency flexibility, and active reserve management policy as appropriate. The second risk is more speculative and novel: in recent years, more sizable gross outflows contributed to the slowdown in net inflows, rather than mitigating it. This is because, in contrast to previous episodes, which featured a tight positive comovement between gross capital inflows and gross capital outflows (Broner and others 2013), such comovement has been much looser this time, including some negative comovement –2 –1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1980 85 90 95 2000 05 10 15 Net capital inflows Net capital inflows excluding China and Russia Number of crises Figure 2.1.

Whether this is a long-lasting feature of the dynamics of gross capital flows remains to be seen, but the analysis draws atten\u0002tion to the possibility. The chapter begins by analyzing capital flow devel\u0002opments, including on the price side, in the context of developments since 2000. Next, it compares the recent slowdown with two similar episodes, one in the early 1980s and the second in the late 1990s, highlighting differences in the structure of external portfolios and exchange rate behavior. It then uses econometric tools to analyze the drivers of the recent slowdown. The chapter’s conclusion summarizes the main findings. Anatomy of the Slowdown in Net Capital Inflows This section presents detailed statistics on the evo\u0002lution of net capital inflows and their components for emerging market economies. The presentation focuses on capital flow dynamics in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and puts the findings in the context of the net capital inflow cycles prior to the crisis.4 The section also looks at the cost of financing, as captured by exchange rates and sovereign yields, which evolve in tandem with capital flows. Preliminaries Detailed data sources, as well as the emerging mar\u0002ket economy sample and variable definitions as used in this chapter, are presented in Annex 2.1. The country sample consists of 45 emerging market economies. To utilize the most recent balance of payments capital flow data, while at the same time avoiding the large seasonal fluctuations in the quarterly data, this section’s findings are based on annual data, combined with data for the first three quarters of 2015. Definitions of key variables used in this chapter are as follows: capital inflows are defined as net acquisition of domestic assets by nonresidents; capital outflows are defined as net acquisition of foreign assets by residents, excluding reserve assets; and net capital inflows are defined as the difference between capital inflows and 4Comparable statistics for the evolution of capital flows in low-income developing countries are discussed in Box 2.1. Results for low-income developing countries reveal notably different capital flow dynamics, with increasing net capital inflows until 2013 and a sharp reversal thereafter. outflows. Net capital inflows and changes in reserve assets together constitute the financial account balance, as defined in the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. Capital Flows Net capital inflows to emerging market economies have shown a sizable decline since 2010 (Figure 2.2). A decline of comparable magnitude is present in all quartiles of the 45-country sample, as well as for the weighted mean of capital inflows.5 The behavior of the weighted mean is similar regardless of whether it includes China and Russia, but with those two coun\u0002tries included, the measure declines more sharply in 2014–15.6 The overall size of the 2010–15 slowdown, mea\u0002sured as the change in net capital inflows between 2010 and the year ending in the third quarter of 2015 (that is, from the fourth quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of 2015), was $1.123 trillion for the full sample of 45 emerging market economies and $448 billion when China and Russia are excluded. Expressed relative to economic activity, the aggregate decline in net capital inflows was 4.9 percent of the sam\u0002ple’s GDP—reflecting that the weighted mean of net capital inflows swung from an inflow of 3.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to an outflow of 1.2 percent during the most recent four quarters (the fourth quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of 2015). The slowdown occurred in three-quarters of the 45 emerging market economies.7 Net inflows in the third quarter of 2015 were particularly weak, and preliminary data suggest that the weakness continued in the fourth quarter. To document the role of key capital flow compo\u0002nents in the 2010–15 slowdown, the analysis next decomposes net capital inflows by direction of flow, type of flow, and recipient region. Starting with the direction of flow, the results show that, over the entire 2010–15 period, the slowdown is explained 5The weighted mean of capital flows is defined throughout the chapter as the GDP-weighted mean of the capital-flow-to-GDP ratio, which is equivalent to the sum of capital inflows divided by the sum of GDP for the countries in the sample. 6China is singled out because of its large size relative to other sam\u0002ple countries, Russia because of the sanctions imposed since 2014. 7The chapter’s sample of 45 countries leaves out several large fuel exporters, such as Algeria, Angola, Kuwait, Nigeria, and Qatar, whose capital flow data do not cover the entire 2000–15 period, but are available more recently. In contrast to most of the countries in the main sample, these fuel exporters exhibited net capital outflows during 2011–15, although, with lower oil prices and trade balances, such net outflows diminished over time. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 66 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 by a fall in inflows (Figure 2.3). At the same time, the decomposition reveals that, behind the sustained decline in net capital inflows, the contributions from inflows and from outflows vary sizably over time. A rise in outflows was the main driver of the slowdown during 2012–14, whereas a decline in inflows was the chief contributor in 2011 and even more so in the first three quarters of 2015. During the latter episode, capital outflows fell as well, mitigating the slowdown in net inflows. Hence, a focus on the flows in only one direction will bias the dating of the slowdown. For example, if only gross inflows are considered, an uninterrupted slowdown starts in 2014 and acceler\u0002ates in 2015. The 2010–15 slowdown reflects some combination of a decline in inflows and a rise in outflows for all four asset types shown in the balance of payments data: foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio equity, portfolio debt, and “other investments” (including bank flows), although the rise in outflows was reversed in 2015. The decline in inflows, which appears in both the weighted-mean and median measures (Figure 2.4, panels 1–4), is somewhat more pronounced for debt-generating inflows than for equity-like8 inflows (including FDI).9 8Equity-like inflows are defined as FDI and portfolio equity inflows. 9Several recent papers focus on the composition of gross capital flows. Cerutti, Claessens, and Puy (2015) find significant heteroge\u0002neity in gross inflows across asset types, with bank-related and port\u0002folio flows comoving more strongly across countries than other types of flows. These authors also find that the role of global push factors varies by the type of flow.

Not for Redistribution 67 CHAPTER 2 UNDERsTaNDINg ThE sLOWDOWN IN CapITaL FLOWs TO EMERgINg MaRKETs International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Figure 2.4 also highlights distinct time profiles for the four asset types. FDI and “other investment”—the two largest gross inflow components—exhibit marked declines relative to the peaks attained before the global financial crisis, with the decline for “other investment” being driven by the retrenchment of global banks following the crisis. In contrast, portfolio debt inflows increased considerably compared with the trough of the crisis, peaking in 2010–12 and declining there\u0002after.10 Last, as revealed by the median in panel 2 of Figure 2.4, portfolio equity inflows remained negligible throughout the 2000–15 period for the majority of the sample. This comparison of inflows by type highlights an important point: that the surge in portfolio inflows after the global financial crisis was not matched by a surge in aggregate gross inflows, which remained below the peak reached in 2007 (Figure 2.3, panel 1). As in the case of inflows, all asset types contribute to the increase in capital outflows during 2010–14, but with more pronounced contributions for debt-generating flows than for equity-like flows (Figure 2.4, panels 5–8). During 2015, outflows for all asset types contracted. Similar to inflows, FDI and “other investment” were the largest components of outflows. The surge in portfolio debt inflows following the global financial crisis was not coupled with a similar pickup in portfolio debt outflows (panels 3 and 7). The slowdown in net capital inflows has been broad based across regions (Figure 2.5). Further results (not shown here to save space) also reveal that both commodity exporters and non–commodity exporters exhibited a similar slowdown. Yet there have been significant interregional differ\u0002ences in the slowdown. It has been more pronounced and persistent in eastern Europe, while in Latin Amer\u0002ica and “other emerging markets” it was concentrated in 2014–15 (Figure 2.5, panels 1, 3, and 4). These differences reflect both the composition of capital flows (notably the sharper decline in bank-based flows in eastern Europe following large inflows before the global financial crisis) and, as documented later in the chapter, greater exchange rate flexibility in Latin Amer\u0002ica, which appears to have mitigated the slowdown. One can also note sizable differences in the average entiate between bond and nonbond capital inflows and find the two types of flows to have a different impact on the economy. 10The surge and heightened volatility in emerging markets’ portfo\u0002lio inflows during 2009–13 and their possible implications have been studied in detail by Sahay and others (2014) as well as in Chapter 3 of the October 2015 Global Financial Stability Report. –1 0 1 2 3 4 2000 05 10 15 –1 0 1 2 3 4 2000 05 10 15 Weighted mean Weighted mean, excluding China and Russia Median Interquartile range –2 0 2 4 6 8 2000 05 10 15 1.

See Annex 2.1 for details. of the Gulf,12 and eastern Europe (Figure 2.5, panels 2, 3, and 6). Meanwhile, Latin America, the Com\u0002monwealth of Independent States, and “other emerging markets” have continued to receive inflows (Figure 2.5, panels 1, 4, and 5). The discussion of capital flows so far has excluded the change in foreign reserve assets, which in this chapter is treated as a separate component of the financial account. The behavior of foreign reserve assets in emerging mar\u0002kets shows a striking similarity to the 2010–15 slow\u0002down in net capital inflows (Figure 2.6). After peaking in 2007, the pace of accumulation of foreign reserve assets gradually slowed, and in the first three quarters of 2015, reserves in the median emerging market economy were reduced by 0.03 percent of GDP.13 To the extent that the 2010–15 slowdown in net capital inflows was matched by a deceleration in the pace at which reserve assets were built up, the adjustment to the slowdown took place within the balance of payments financial account and, hence, did not require an accompanying adjustment in the current account. This observation is explored in more detail in a later section. How robust is the preceding interpretation of recent capital flow developments in emerging markets? Several tests suggest the findings are not sensitive to a range of potential measurement issues. First, results pertaining to the 2010–15 slowdown remain broadly unchanged if constant exchange rates are used. In some emerging markets, exchange rates have depreciated sizably against the dollar. The depreciation has driven down the value of emerging market economies’ GDPs measured in dollar terms and could, therefore, have increased the measured capital-flow-to-GDP ratio. The calculations show that using current exchange rates generates an upward bias in the ratio of capital flows to GDP but has a limited quantitative impact on this chapter’s capital flow statistics. Second, the documented findings are robust to using alternative samples. The results in Figures 2.2–2.6 remain broadly similar if the full sample (which includes 45 countries) is replaced with a subset consisting of the 20 largest emerging market economies. The findings in Figure 2.4 are not sensitive to the balanced-sample 12Among the member states of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, full 2000–15 sample coverage is available only for Saudi Arabia. 13The pattern of a decline in net reserve asset accumulation is considerably more pronounced when Russia and, especially, China are included in the sample; both countries witnessed a reduction in their reserves in the first half of 2015. –5 0 5 10 15 20 2000 05 10 15 Weighted mean Median Interquartile range –2 0 2 4 6 8 10 2000 05 10 15 Figure 2.5.

Also, the results are robust to the exclusion of China and Russia from the full sam\u0002ple. Th e latter fi nding can be seen in Figures 2.2–2.5 by comparing the weighted mean for the full sample of 45 countries with the weighted mean that excludes China and Russia. While China is a dominant emerg\u0002ing market in terms of the size of both its GDP and its capital fl ows, its capital fl ows as a share of its GDP are broadly in line with those of other emerging markets. However, China’s international reserves are well above the average for other emerging markets, both in level terms and in terms of the average pace of accumulation over 2000–15 as well. Exchange Rates and the Cost of Capital Th e exchange rates of emerging market economies, taken as a group, depreciated notably, particularly with respect to the dollar, during the 2010–15 slowdown, with the bulk of the adjustment taking place in 2014– 15 (Figure 2.7, panel 1). Th e currency depreciations were considerably less pronounced in eff ective terms (Figure 2.7, panel 2), as most currencies depreciated against the dollar over the same period.14 However, there was considerable cross-country heterogeneity in exchange rate behavior over the period (Figure 2.8).

At the same time, nominal effective exchange rates appreciated in more than two-fifths of the emerging market economies in the sample, including in China, Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand. For the cross section of the sample’s emerging market economies there is no systematic correlation (–0.04) between the slowdown in net capital inflows and changes in nominal effective exchange rates. However, countries with the largest depreciations (20 percent or more) on average saw a smaller slowdown (2.3 percent of GDP) than did the rest of the sample (4.5 percent of GDP).15 At the same time, several key emerging market economies with large nominal 15The group of countries with the largest depreciations includes Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Turkey but excludes Rus\u0002sia, given that Russia’s capital flows were affected by an idiosyncratic factor (international sanctions). effective exchange rate appreciations had above-average slowdowns. China is the leading case among such economies, with the sample’s largest exchange rate appreciation in nominal effective terms (22.5 percent) and an above-average fall in net capital inflows (8.2 percent of GDP). This evidence suggests that flexible exchange rates might have mitigated the slowdown in net capital inflows. The overall cost of borrowing in emerging market economies is well below levels observed prior to the global financial crisis. The main contributor to the historically low level of borrowing costs is the declining trend in bond yields in advanced economies over the past two decades. For example, 10-year U.S. Trea\u0002sury bond yields decreased from 640 basis points to 200 basis points between 2000 and 2015. Over the same period, emerging market sovereign spreads—as captured by the J.P. Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index—decreased for the median country by 170 basis points (Figure 2.9, panel 1). However, sovereign spreads have increased in recent quarters. The fall in net capital flows during the 2010–15 slowdown was associated with rising sover\u0002eign spreads in emerging market economies (Figure 2.9, panel 2). At the same time, countries with larger depreciations in nominal effective exchange rates faced higher spreads (Figure 2.9, panel 3). Historical Comparisons: What Is Different This Time? To put the 2010–15 slowdown in historical perspec\u0002tive, this section compares it with two similar past epi\u0002sodes (in the early 1980s and late 1990s) and examines shifts in the structural characteristics and policies of emerging market economies in the intervening years. The three major capital flow slowdown episodes, as measured from the peak to the bottom of the ratio of total net capital inflows to GDP, are 1981–88, 1995– 2000, and 2010 through the third quarter of 2015 (Figure 2.10).16 The first of these episodes covers the 16A strand of research starting in the 1990s focuses on unexpected and abrupt reversals in net capital flows—the so-called sudden stops (see Dornbusch and others 1994 and Calvo 1998). Subse\u0002quently assembled historical evidence shows that boom-bust cycles in cross-border capital flows are not new: capital flows displayed long-lasting swings of up to several percentage points of GDP in the first globalization period, which started in the late nineteenth cen\u0002tury and ended with the Great Depression of the 1930s (see Catão 2007; Bordo and Haubrich 2010; Reinhart and Rogoff 2011; and Accominotti and Eichengreen, forthcoming). –50 –40 –30 –20 –10 0 10 20 30 –16 –14 –12 –10 –8 –6 –4 –2 0 2 4 6 8 10 ZAF VNM URY TWN TUR THA SLV SAU RUS ROM PRY POL PHL PER MYS MEX MDA LKA KOR IND IDN HUN HRV GTM GEO ECU CZE CRI COL CHN CHL BRA BGR ARM ALB Change in nominal effective exchange rate (percent) Change in net capital flows (percentage points of GDP) Figure 2.8.

All three episodes were preceded by a prolonged surge in capital inflows, and all three are similar both in the aggregate size of the slowdown (ranging from 2.4 percent to 4.8 percent) and in the fraction of the economies with declining ratios of net capital inflows to GDP (65 percent to 76 percent).17 17In terms of the aggregate size of the slowdown, the 2010–15 episode is more comparable with earlier episodes when China is excluded from the sample, decreasing the size of the slowdown from –4.8 percent to –3.3 percent of GDP. Changing Structure of External Portfolios Capital flows to and from emerging market econ\u0002omies affect those economies’ external portfolios, and the external portfolio structures, in turn, affect capital flows. After each of the previous two slow\u0002downs, emerging market economies saw a surge in cross-border capital flows; as a result, over time they accumulated external assets and liabilities and became increasingly integrated into global financial markets. This has meant more asset trade with other countries, especially with advanced economies, but potentially also more cross-border spillovers.18 Between 1980 and 2014, external equity liabilities of emerging market economies surged, from below 10 18The IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey shows that advanced economies are the main source of, and destination for, the increased capital flows involving emerging market economies.

In the aggregate, the increase in portfolio debt is largely offset by a decline in banks’ debt liabilities, reflecting the postcrisis deleveraging of global banks. 21Avdjiev, Chui, and Shin (2014) show that the split of assets into equity and debt is not clear-cut, as much of FDI is actually not equity, but intrafirm debt. In the three decades leading up to 2009, the increase in the ratio of foreign reserves to GDP largely kept pace with the rise in the rest of external portfolio assets (Figure 2.11, panel 2). The increase in foreign reserves was most pronounced in east Asia, especially after the Asian crisis of 1997–98 (Figure 2.11, panel 3), whereas the increase in the stock of nonreserve assets was more uniform across regions (Figure 2.11, panel 4).22 These structural changes in external portfolios have several immediate and important implications for the episodes of slowdowns in net capital inflows, which are discussed next. Increasing Role of Capital Outflows The flip side of the increasing external assets of emerging markets is that gross capital outflows have gradually increased in size and are playing an increas\u0002ingly important role in net capital flow dynamics. One way to see this is by comparing the contributions of capital inflows and outflows to the three slowdown episodes shown in Figure 2.12. In the 1980s, the slowdown was driven entirely by a decline in capital inflows. The same explanation broadly holds for the 1995–2000 slowdown episode. In contrast, capital outflows are contributing sizably to the most recent emerging market capital flow cycle.23 The growing role for capital outflows can at least partly be linked to income growth and the accompany\u0002ing increase in outward FDI from emerging markets, as well as to institutional shifts, such as the emergence of pension funds and sovereign wealth funds. These devel\u0002opments open a possibility for gross outflows to play a role in the dynamics of net capital flows for emerging market economies. Chapter 4 of the October 2013 World Economic Outlook argues that emerging markets can improve their capital flow management through development of their financial markets, which fosters private sector outflows that can help stabilize net capital flows. Indeed, the overall strong positive correlation between capital inflows and outflows in emerging mar\u0002kets over 2000–10, shown in Figure 2.12, supports the 22For a comparative discussion on the links between capital flows and trends in reserve accumulation in emerging markets and advanced economies, see Choi, Sharma, and Strömqvist 2009. 23A significant part of the increased importance of gross capital outflows likely reflects improvements in the measurement of capital outflows over time. A number of studies (see, for example, Claessens and Naude 1993) argue that data for 1980–90 were marked by a severe underreporting of outflows, as capital flight was not captured in the balance of payments statistics. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 1980 84 88 92 96 2000 04 08 12 1.

External Balance Sheets of Emerging Market Economies, 1980–2014 (Percent of GDP) Emerging market economies are increasingly integrated into global financial markets. The increase in the external liabilities of these economies has been mostly driven by equity liabilities, while on the external asset side, both equity and debt assets have contributed. Growth in reserve assets has broadly kept pace with nonreserve assets and has been particularly pronounced in east Asia.

Yet over 2012–14, outflows exacerbated the decline in net inflows, suggesting that a potentially destabilizing role cannot be ruled out. Decline in Currency Mismatches A large literature has documented the propensity of emerging markets to acquire foreign-currency debt liabilities and the attendant risks of doing so, stem\u0002ming mainly from adverse balance sheet effects in case of a currency devaluation. Indeed, as discussed later, almost the entire stock of emerging market debt until the early 2000s was denominated in foreign curren\u0002cies. By increasing their holdings of external assets by more than the increase in their external debt liabilities, emerging market economies as a whole have therefore considerably reduced the currency mismatch in their overall net external portfolios. When only external debt assets are considered, the overall improvement in the net external position since the 1980s is about 20 per\u0002cent of emerging market GDP. When foreign reserve assets are added, the decline in the net external posi\u0002tion goes up to 30 percent of GDP (Figure 2.13).24 The improvement is even more remarkable if external portfolio equity assets and the stock of FDI abroad are taken into account. A second and more direct force reducing the currency mismatch has been the rise of debt liabili\u0002ties denominated in domestic currency. The “original sin” of emerging market economies—the propensity to issue debt denominated in foreign currency (doc\u0002umented by Eichengreen and Hausmann 1998 and Eichengreen, Hausmann, and Panizza 2002)—has been substantially alleviated in both international and domestic markets. The domestic-currency share of outstanding gov\u0002ernment debt rose substantially between 1995 and 24These trends in emerging market currency exposures have been documented in more detail by Lane and Shambaugh (2010) and Benetrix, Shambaugh, and Lane (2015). –2 –1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1980 85 90 95 2000 05 10 14 Inflows Outflows Figure 2.12.

Given the finding that the share of total government debt held by nonresi\u0002dents was stable between 2004 and 2012 (Arslanalp and Tsuda 2014), the decline in original sin in public debt appears to have occurred both domestically and internationally. Original sin also declined in the non\u0002government sector (Figure 2.14, panel 2). The much stronger increases for the weighted average share issued in domestic currency than for the median share suggest that original sin declined more in larger emerging market economies. Despite the documented decline in currency mis\u0002matches, substantial vulnerabilities related to exchange rate movements remain. First, the net external debt position shown in Figure 2.13 abstracts from differ\u0002ences in maturity and liquidity of assets and liabilities as well as from sectoral mismatches within econo\u0002mies. Second, as documented in Chapter 3 of the October 2015 Global Financial Stability Report, the stock of emerging market corporate debt has grown substantially over the past decade, even as the share of foreign-currency-denominated debt in total debt has declined. Finally, the majority of indicators of foreign-currency mismatches in Figures 2.13 and 2.14 peaked prior to 2010 and have remained stable or declined since.25 Shifts in Policy Under the balance of payments identity, the sum of net nonreserve capital inflows and the current account balance equals the change in foreign reserves.26 Hence, slowdowns in net nonreserve capital inflows are coun\u0002tered by some combination of a slower accumulation (or a faster decumulation) of foreign reserves and a higher current account balance. The three components of the identity are jointly determined. For example, during the years leading up to the global financial crisis, many commodity-exporting emerging market economies received strong capital inflows amid rising investment opportunities and accumulated reserves, with strong terms-of-trade gains offsetting the impact of rapid import growth on the current account. With the decline in commodity prices and more subdued growth prospects from 2011 onward, the process began to reverse. The following analysis uses the balance of payments identity as a guiding framework and dis\u0002cusses three relevant dimensions of the macro adjust\u0002ment across episodes: exchange rates, foreign reserves, and the current account. Foreign Reserves as a Buffer Relative to previous slowdown episodes, in 2010–15 reserves played an important buffer role. To document this, based on the balance of payments identity, this subsection examines the extent to which the recent slowdown in emerging market net capital inflows has been countered by an increase in the current account balance—with potentially negative consequences for 25Only a part of the decline can be attributed to recent exchange rate depreciations in emerging markets. 26Two other items in the identity, typically small, are the capital account balance and errors and omissions. Here these terms are included in capital flows. Inclusion of errors and omissions in capital flows improves the measurement of changes in the current account and foreign reserves.

Table 2.1 shows that for emerging markets as a whole, for each dollar decline in net capital inflows from 2010 through the third quarter of 2015, the current account balance increased by only 7 cents, while 93 cents came from the change in the pace of reserve accumulation. This change in pace reflects the fact that, while in 2010 the sample emerging markets as a group were accumulating foreign reserves, by 2015 the accumulation had stopped, and some countries are now decumulating foreign reserves (Figure 2.6). In contrast, during 1995–2000 the main counterpart to the capital inflow slowdown was an increase in current account balances amid a typically lower level of reserves. As noted earlier, changes in net inflows and reserve accumulation during this period were substantial— close to 5 percent of countries’ GDP. Most of the decline occurred from 2013 onward, a period during which China accounted for more than 80 percent of the change in net capital inflows and reserves. During this more recent period, the share of adjustment com\u0002ing from the current account was higher in the overall sample, at 18 cents. The number is even higher once China is excluded, at 30 cents. Table 2.1 also shows that during the capital flow surge episode of 2001–07, reserves played the role of a buffer. In fact, as a group, sample emerging markets even had an increase in current account balances (in some instances reflecting improved terms of trade), and the increased pace of reserve accumulation more than offset the surge in net capital inflows. One implica\u0002tion of this increased pace of reserve accumulation is that only in 2015 did emerging markets start to run down the liquidity buffers they had accumulated during the capital inflow boom episode that preceded the global financial crisis. During the 2010–14 period of the current slowdown, reserves continued to be accumulated, albeit at a decreasing pace (Figure 2.15). Furthermore, while in the initial years of the 2010–15 slowdown, the current account balances of emerging markets decreased—so that the decrease in the pace of reserve accumulation more than compensated for the slowdown in net capital inflows—during 2014–15, the current account balances increased, thus countering part of the slowdown. The fact that reserve accumulation slowed down in tandem with diminished capital inflows (or turned into reserve losses in some countries seeing outflows) also has a positive side: by facilitating the repayment of residents’ foreign-currency liabilities, the sale of foreign assets could reduce balance sheet fragilities and curtail the risk of default in the event that a currency depre\u0002ciation eventually occurs. With strengthened domestic balance sheets, a currency depreciation can play its traditional role in switching demand toward domestic production and thus smooth the adjustment of output. Indeed, currency depreciation in 2014–15 coincides with the increase in the current account balance over the same period (Figure 2.15). Increased Exchange Rate Flexibility and More Orderly Currency Depreciations Flexible exchange rates cushion economic shocks and thus reduce the required amount of adjustment in capital flows. The main reason is that an immediate currency depreciation following an adverse shock raises Table 2.1.

Emerging market economies have been moving toward more flexi\u0002ble exchange rate regimes over the past two decades.28 Though exchange rates in many emerging market economies weakened in 2010–15, the depreciations 27Likewise, immediate appreciations in response to positive shocks deter capital inflows, as domestic assets become more expensive. 28Excluding countries that joined the euro area, 10 of the 45 economies in the sample saw an increase in their Reinhart-Rogoff flexibility indices from 1995 to 2010 (Argentina, Brazil, Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Moldova, Thailand). Furthermore, 7 economies that were classified as having freely falling exchange rate regimes in 1995 had flexible exchange rate regimes in 2010 (Armenia, Belarus, Mexico, Romania, Russia, Turkey, Uruguay). Over the same period the Reinhart-Rogoff flexibility index decreased for 4 of the sample’s emerging markets (Albania, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Paraguay). were less abrupt than they were in 1995–2000, and the overall size of the depreciation was smaller. Coun\u0002tries with relatively fixed exchange rate regimes29 in 1995–2000 experienced sudden adjustments, in part reflecting pegs abandoned during currency crises. Several countries experienced an abrupt decline in their nominal effective exchange rates beginning in the third year of the episode, in 1998. For the 35 economies in the sample with relatively fixed exchange rate regimes in 1995, five fell into what Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) call “a freely falling exchange rate regime”30 in one of the years between 1995 and 2000. In contrast, through the 2010–15 slowdown, countries with rela\u0002tively fixed exchange rates maintained a stable nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 2.16, panel 1). For countries with flexible exchange rate regimes,31 the nominal effective exchange rate was stable in the first two years of the 1995–2000 episode and abruptly declined afterward, while in the 2010–15 episode, such countries saw a wide range of adjustments in their nominal effective exchange rates (Figure 2.16, panel 2). That pattern is consistent with the notion that exchange rate adjustments act as shock absorbers, and varying adjustments indicate that the shocks them\u0002selves were diverse (such as terms-of-trade declines in some countries and improvements in others). The large currency depreciations in 2010–15 were more orderly than those in 1995–2000, in the sense that there were fewer large depreciations over a short period of time, and a much lower share of large depreciation episodes was associated with episodes of banking sector stress and external crises (Table 2.2, columns 4–6). The reduction in the incidence of crisis events is likely a consequence of a combination of fac\u0002tors. In addition to the less abrupt nature of exchange rate depreciations and more resilient balance sheets (with diminished currency mismatches), the external environment has been more favorable to emerging markets in the recent episode. First, the cost of financ\u0002ing in emerging markets during the current slowdown remains significantly lower than during 1995–2000 (Table 2.2, column 1). Although emerging market spreads have increased in recent quarters, they remain close to historical lows amid accommodative monetary conditions in advanced economies.

This favorable growth differential has helped emerging market economies continue to attract capital. What Is Driving the Recent Slowdown in Capital Flows to Emerging Market Economies? The drivers of the recent slowdown in net capital flows to emerging market economies are the subject of ongoing debate. While some analysts have argued that the slowdown is a consequence of diminished growth prospects in emerging market economies (including through lower commodity prices), others have high\u0002lighted the role of prospective shifts in monetary policy in the United States following several years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing. Against this backdrop, the goals of this section are twofold. The first goal is to link the recent slowdown in capital inflows to emerging market economies (and the pickup in capital outflows) to a set of potential contributing factors such as diminished growth and interest rate differentials, the exit from extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy in the United States, and changes in investors’ risk appetite and commodity prices. Given evidence that gross inflows and gross outflows have in their own right—rather than just in terms of the net gap between them—a distinct impor\u0002tance in determining systemic risk (Avdjiev, McCauley, and Shin 2015), the following econometric analysis provides separate regressions seeking to explain the individual behaviors of gross inflows and outflows. The section’s second goal is to examine how the structural characteristics and policy frameworks of emerging market economies shape the dynamics of capital flows, such as whether flexible exchange rates have helped mitigate the slowdown in capital flows. Methodology Empirical Strategy To achieve these goals, two complementary esti\u0002mation strategies are used, each tailored to a specific purpose:32 32The macroeconomic variables used in the regressions, such as GDP and capital flows, influence each other in complex ways, mak- • To understand the drivers of the slowdown in cap\u0002ital flows to emerging market economies, the aver\u0002age of capital flows to a broad sample of emerging market economies is regressed on key economic explanatory factors such as differentials in the growth rates and interest rates between emerging market and advanced economies, measures of global investors’ risk appetite, the gap between ing it difficult to obtain clear causal estimates.

The advantage of this spec\u0002ification is that it can be used to track the drivers of the slowdown in aggregate flows documented in previous sections.33 • To zoom in on how structural characteristics and policies of recipient countries shape the dynamics of capital flows (during the recent slowdown in partic\u0002ular), the relationship of capital flows to growth and interest rate differentials for each country (measured relative to a weighted basket of advanced economies’ growth and interest rates, respectively), as well as to emerging market structural characteristics and policies on capital flows, is explored.34 Within each step, inflows and outflows are exam\u0002ined separately given the earlier finding that both components have contributed to the recent slowdown in net flows. Relationship to Existing Literature In general terms, the empirical specifications used in this section can be motivated by international investors’ optimal portfolio allocation decisions. Cross-border capital flows reflect decisions by resi\u0002dents and nonresidents to allocate investments across countries. Investments in a particular country are more desirable the higher the risk-adjusted returns relative to those from investing in other countries. Expected returns from investing in a particular 33For a detailed description of the methodology, see Annex 2.3. 34For a detailed description of the methodology, see Annex 2.3. country can be related to factors such as growth and interest rate differentials, the risk appetite of investors, and the quality of domestic policymaking and institutions. An extensive empirical literature has sought to explain determinants of cross-border capital flows, focusing on gross inflows or net flows. Ahmed and Zlate (2013) estimate a panel regression for 12 emerging market economies to examine determi\u0002nants of net capital inflows during 2002–12. Key country-specific and global explanatory variables that these authors consider are emerging mar\u0002ket–advanced economy growth rate differentials, emerging market–U.S. interest rate differentials, and global risk aversion, as well as capital controls as a policy variable. In another recent paper, Nier, Sedik, and Mondino (2014) estimate a similar panel regression for gross non-FDI capital inflows of 29 emerging market economies with the same key explanatory variables and add market capitaliza\u0002tion and public debt as country-specific structural characteristics and policy variables. In both of these studies, GDP growth rate differentials and global risk aversion emerge as the most robust statistically significant determinants of aggregate capital flows to emerging market economies. In an extensive survey of the empirical capital flow literature, Koepke (2015) similarly lists emerging market economic performance and global risk aversion among the most important determinants of capital flows to emerging market economies. The empirical specifications used in this section are broadly consistent with these earlier studies. The chap\u0002ter’s findings in terms of the significance of various Table 2.2.

The key addition of the chapter’s analysis to the existing literature is to use the regression model to estimate the contribution of specific economic factors to the 2010–15 slowdown in net capital inflows to emerging market economies. A further contribution is to use an augmented panel regression specification to study the impact of emerging market structural charac\u0002teristics and policies on capital inflows in general, and during the 2010–15 slowdown in particular. Data The sample of 22 countries included in the analysis was selected on the basis of quarterly data availability for the first quarter of 2000 through the second quar\u0002ter of 2015 (see Annex 2.1 for the list of countries).35 The starting point for the time period is motivated by data coverage for some of the explanatory variables and helps to mitigate econometric issues associated with structural breaks in capital flow dynamics during the 1980s and 1990s. For a detailed description of included variables and their sources, see Annex 2.2. Estimation Results Linking the Overall Emerging Market Slowdown to Contributing Economic Factors Average growth and interest rate differentials between emerging markets and advanced economies, global investor risk appetite, the U.S. yield gap, and spreads on U.S. high-yield bonds are estimated to be statistically significant determinants of average capital inflows to emerging market economies. The regression results for average capital inflows to emerging market economies are presented in Annex Table 2.3.1. To gauge the economic significance of the explana\u0002tory variables, panels 1 and 2 of Figure 2.17 compare actual average capital inflows with predictions from this regression. Panel 1 points to a tight empirical link between the actual and predicted capital inflows—for the estimation period as a whole as well as during 2010–15. Predictions from this regression model can match almost the entire slowdown in capital inflows between 2010 and 2015. Panel 2 breaks down the 35The sample includes China and Russia (before 2014), but the results are qualitatively similar when these two countries are excluded.

Other factors, such as global risk appetite, commodity prices, and accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies, contribute, but sub\u0002stantially less.36 Overall, the strong association between capital flows and real GDP growth stands out as very robust to alternative sets of explanatory variables and sample breakdowns.37 Panels 3 and 4 in Figure 2.17 present symmetric results for overall emerging market capital outflows, with the regression results reported in Annex Table 2.3.2. The model does not perform that differently in regard to its predictions for outflows before the global financial crisis than it does in regard to its predictions for inflows. After 2010, however, the model does fall short of explaining the large outflows associated with the 2013 “taper tantrum” and the very recent pickup in outflows (Figure 2.17, panel 3). As discussed in Box 2.2, this deficiency is partly due to large tempo\u0002rary shifts in market expectations regarding the course of monetary policy in the United States, which are difficult to control for in a relatively parsimonious regression specification using quarterly data. This change in the correlation pattern between inflows and outflows is a relatively new phenomenon; Broner and others (2013) show that in earlier episodes, rising inflows were typically accompanied by pickups in outflows. Karolyi, Ng, and Prasad (2013) highlight that outflows are increasingly driven by new, structural factors, notably portfolio rebalancing by domestic institutional investors facilitated by greater access to information. Such structural drivers of outflows are not easily picked up by regression analysis based on macroeconomic data. Role of Country Characteristics and Policies The second step of the analysis focuses on the role of structural characteristics and policies in shaping the dynamics of capital flows to emerging 36When total capital inflows are broken up into debt and equity components, the growth differential still shows a very strong associ\u0002ation with both components, and a stronger slowdown is predicted for debt than for equity, in line with the behavior of actual flows. The strong association between debt flows and real GDP growth is consistent with well-established evidence of the beneficial effects of growth in lowering default risk. 37This includes separating commodity exporters from non–com\u0002modity exporters in the sample. Evidence on the significance of com\u0002modity price changes and associated effects on country-specific terms of trade and capital flows is provided later in the chapter. market economies. To this end, the section uses a panel data specification that relates country-specific capital flows to country-specific growth and interest rate differentials and to country characteristics, as well as country and time fixed effects.38 The regres\u0002sion, shown in the first column of Annex Table 2.3.3, results in a positive and statistically signif\u0002icant coefficient on the growth differential, while the estimated coefficients on the real interest rate differential and other country characteristics are not statistically significant. The time fixed effects included in this specifi\u0002cation are highly correlated with average capital inflows to emerging market economies used in the previous analysis (Figure 2.18) and are thus capturing, by and large, the effects of global vari\u0002ables fleshed out previously—namely, the emerging market–advanced economy growth and interest rate differentials, as well as global financial conditions, including changes in the U.S. monetary policy stance and global risk appetite. The extent to which the estimated common trend in capital inflows (that is, the estimated time effects) accounts for the total variation in capital inflows depends on policy characteristics that are country specific (Figure 2.19).39 This in turn indicates that individual emerging market economies are not simply bystanders—their policy choices matter for how they 38The methodology is explained in greater detail in Annex 2.3. The initial regression included not only expected growth and interest rate differentials, but also changes in the country’s terms of trade, an indicator of its institutional quality, whether the country is partici\u0002pating in a large IMF-sponsored adjustment program, whether the country is in default with creditors, and the degree to which capital inflows to the country are restricted by law. The sample excludes some quarterly observations of very high interest rates (Argentina, Brazil, and Turkey in the early 2000s). All variables except the growth differential were determined to be nonsignificant and were therefore dropped from the regression. The statistically nonsignificant and negatively signed coefficient on changes in a country’s terms of trade is noteworthy. To the extent that lower real GDP growth picks up the effects of lower commodity prices among commodity exporters, the statistical nonsignificance of the terms-of-trade variable is partly due to its collinearity with GDP growth. The negative sign of the coefficient on that variable (albeit statistically nonsignificant) can be rationalized by the fact that weaker terms of trade tend to reduce the current account balance (all other factors held constant), necessitating higher external financing. Results are robust to the use of different measures of institutions and capital controls. 39Indeed, recent work by Aizenman, Chinn, and Ito (2015) shows that interactions between global liquidity trends and global growth are critical for understanding the exposure of individual emerging markets to swings in international capital flows. ©International Monetary Fund.

This is evident in Figure 2.19 from the fact that a higher share of the total variance of capital inflows is explained by the common time effect (with differences in countries’ expected growth performance controlled for) in countries with more open capital accounts. While this evidence may seem tautological at first, it does suggest that capital control regulations can have a real impact without implying, however, that they can be as effective (and certainly not as desirable) as other policy tools. • More flexible exchange rates also reduce the share of the total variance of capital inflows explained by common global factors. This effect appears to be quantitatively very important and is further elabo\u0002rated on in the discussion later in this section.40 • By contrast, countries that have higher reserves and lower public debt tend to have a lower percentage of the fluctuations in their capital inflows attributable to global factors. The findings for most of these characteristics seem intuitive. For instance, countries that have flexible exchange rate regimes would tend to see immedi\u000240Aside from the discussion on the existence of a monetary policy trilemma referred to earlier, a large literature has studied the effectiveness of the exchange rate as a shock absorber. There is scarce evidence, however, on its role in smoothing the global capital flow cycle. Magud, Reinhart, and Vesperoni (2014) provide evidence that exchange rate flexibility smoothens the domestic credit cycle but find no evidence, in their regression analysis, that it dampens capital flows in itself (see Magud, Reinhart, and Vesperoni 2014, Table 4). –5 0 5 10 15 20 25 2000:Q1 02:Q1 04:Q1 06:Q1 08:Q1 10:Q1 12:Q1 14:Q1 Gross inflows to EMEs (simple average) Gross inflows to EMEs (GDP-weighted average) Time fixed effects Figure 2.18.

By making domestic assets cheaper, a weaker currency would tend to attract capital into a country. Thus, exchange rate flexibility would reduce the sensitivity of capital inflows to global factors. Likewise, because higher levels of reserves and lower public debt levels reduce country risk, foreign inves\u0002tors would be less tempted to pull out from countries with those characteristics, making their capital inflows more resilient to shifts in the global factors affecting all emerging market economies. In light of these findings, the common time effects are interacted with dummy variables that split countries with low and high levels of capital controls, countries with less or more flexible exchange rates, countries with lower and higher levels of reserves, and countries with higher and lower debt levels. F-statis\u0002tics confirm that the resulting interaction terms are highly statistically significant (see Annex Table 2.3.5). The relevance of these interaction terms is corrobo\u0002rated by a sizable increase in the regression’s fit: once such interactions of country-specific characteristics with the global trend are allowed for, the regression can explain an extra 31 percent of fluctuations in inflows (as gauged by the adjusted R-squared values rising from 0.12 to 0.43). Policy-controlled variables, including the degree of capital account openness, exchange rate flexibility, and the level of reserves and public debt, also help explain the diversity of experiences across countries during the 2010–15 slowdown more specifically. All else being constant, economies that had an above-average degree of openness in their capital accounts lost 4 percentage points of GDP in capital inflows compared with those that had below-average degrees of openness (Figure 2.20). More generally, economies that were more open to inflows received far more inflows in the upswing of the global cycle (2002–07), and they tended to receive far less in the downswing phase. Regarding differ\u0002ences in the domain of reserves and fiscal variables, for countries with below-average levels of reserves or above-average ratios of public debt to GDP, the decline in inflows was 0.6–1 percentage point of GDP larger than was the case for countries with higher levels of reserves or lower debt levels. Yet the biggest difference stems from exchange rate flexibility. Consistent with the foregoing discussion about the insulation properties of a floating exchange rate, the second bar in Figure 2.20 shows that coun\u0002tries with less flexible exchange rate arrangements lost about 4.5 percent of GDP in capital inflows during 2010–15 compared with those with more flexible exchange rates. This finding can be elaborated further by delv\u0002ing into how exchange rate flexibility interacts with each of the main global factors highlighted in Figure 2.17—that is, the overall growth and interest rate differentials between emerging markets and advanced economies, as well as global risk aversion. As illus\u0002trated in Figure 2.21, a 75 basis point narrowing in the expected growth differential between emerging markets and advanced economies (which was roughly the annual average change in that differential during 2010–15) reduces capital flows by more than 4 percent of GDP, all else being constant, if a country has a fixed exchange rate regime. But if a country has a more flexi\u0002ble exchange rate, the expected drop declines to about 1.5 percent of GDP.

Extending the panel specifi\u0002cations reported in Annex Table 2.3.3 by adding terms for the interaction between the degree of exchange rate flexibility and growth differentials suggests that in countries with more flexible exchange rates, inflows are less sensitive to changes in the country’s own growth differential relative to advanced economies. Though the econometric precision of such estimates is not as high as that for other estimates reported elsewhere in this chapter, this is an effect that seems important to bear in mind when evaluating the effects on capital flows of differences in growth performance across emerging markets. Conclusions This chapter documents a sizable slowdown in net capital inflows to emerging market economies during 2010–15, to which both inflows and outflows contrib\u0002uted. The slowdown during the period is observed in about three-quarters of emerging market economies, and it is broad based across regions. Capital flows to emerging market economies over the last several decades have exhibited distinct cycles, with previous slowdowns in the early 1980s and late 1990s showing a size and breadth that are broadly comparable to those of the current episode. As such, the current slowdown is not unprecedented. Never\u0002theless, the current episode is distinct in that substan\u0002tial structural changes and policy shifts have taken place in emerging market economies since the late 1990s. Emerging market economies are now far more financially integrated into global financial markets, and currency mismatches (notably in public sector 41In a sample spanning 2000–15, such a historical average may be more elevated than that in a longer sample, because of the big spikes in global risk aversion in 2008 and 2009. This makes the compari\u0002son exercise embodied in Figure 2.21 more extreme than might seem likely, but it does deliver the important point that countries with floating and fixed exchange rates can differ substantially in regard to their resilience to “pushes” in global risk aversion. borrowing) have been reduced. As emerging market residents now face lower capital controls than they did in the 1980s and 1990s and are wealthier—especially after years of brisk growth prior to the global financial crisis of 2008–09—they seek to diversify their port\u0002folios internationally. This turns capital outflows into an increasingly important component of the overall dynamics of capital flows. Also in contrast with the past, emerging market economies now have much higher foreign reserves, which can be deployed as a buffer. As documented in this chapter, changes in the pace of reserve accumulation, including some decu\u0002mulation, have counterbalanced much of the 2010–15 slowdown in net capital inflows. Moreover, exchange rates have become more flexible and are adjusting in a more orderly way in the current slowdown than in previous episodes.

Nevertheless, flexible exchange rates have helped mitigate the slowdown associated with a declining growth differential. Such insulation effects are consistent with the existence of the classical trilemma in monetary policy choices, rather than a mere dilemma between more or fewer capital con\u0002trols. While the chapter’s estimation results are less robust and harder to interpret for the determinants of capital outflows, its contribution on this count is to highlight the increasing importance of such outflows and to point out the need for more research on what drives them. In terms of policy implications, the chapter docu\u0002ments that policy frameworks have played a role in mit\u0002igating the individual-country effects of global factors, implying that countries are not simply bystanders to the global financial cycle. Policy frameworks have gener\u0002ally improved over time, reducing the vulnerabilities stemming from a potentially disorderly retrenchment of capital flows and the balance sheet effects that accom\u0002pany exchange rate adjustments. These improvements notwithstanding, a persistent narrowing of growth differentials in relation to advanced economies and the accompanying slowdown in capital inflows reinforce the need for a continued policy upgrade in emerging market economies to ensure an orderly external sector adjust\u0002ment. The necessary policies include prudent fiscal pol\u0002icies (as the slowdown can raise the cost to an economy of servicing its debt), proactive macroprudential policies (to limit currency mismatches), exchange rate flexibil\u0002ity (which can work as a shock absorber), and foreign reserve management (which can insulate the domestic economy from shocks, though not indefinitely). The chapter’s analysis also highlights the need for increased vigilance with regard to capital outflow dynamics, which can pose substantial risks, but are not yet sufficiently well understood. Annex 2.1. Sample of Emerging Market Economies The broadest sample of emerging market econo\u0002mies used for the analysis in this chapter comprises 45 emerging market economies. Countries were selected for the sample based on the availability of key capital flow data—capital inflows, capital outflows, and net capital inflows—based on annual balance of payments statistics for the 2000–14 period and quarterly balance of payments statistics for the first three quarters of 2015. The complete list of countries, grouped by region, is shown in Annex Table 2.1.1. The country sample for the regression analysis includes the following subset of 22 emerging market economies: Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, the Slovak Republic, South Africa, Taiwan Province of China, Thailand, and Turkey.

To ensure that the results are not unduly influenced by high-inflation episodes, the analysis considers only large depreciations that occur when the inflation rate is less than 50 percent.

Not for Redistribution 87 CHAPTER 2 UNDERsTaNDINg ThE sLOWDOWN IN CapITaL FLOWs TO EMERgINg MaRKETs International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Country-specific forecast growth and interest rate differentials are measured as the difference between a particular emerging market’s rate and a weighted average of rates in advanced economies (with the latter group consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States), with country-specific weights depending on average portfo\u0002lio exposures during 2001–12 based on data from the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (see Annex 2.3). Forecast growth is measured using one-year\u0002ahead World Economic Outlook growth forecasts. Interest rate differentials are based on policy rates, deflated using one-year-ahead World Economic Outlook inflation forecasts. Institutional quality is measured using the rule of law measure from the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators. Capital controls on inflows and outflows are based on Fernández and others 2015. A country is defined as having a large IMF-supported adjustment program if its IMF borrowing is more than 100 percent of its quota and growing. Default is mea\u0002sured following Standard & Poor’s (S&P) definition (see Catão and Mano 2015). Fixed and floating exchange rates are defined using the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions classifi\u0002cation, as this measure is available through 2015. Global growth differentials are based on weighted averages of the growth rates of 20 emerging markets and the advanced economies listed previously, with weights depending on average portfolio exposures using Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey data (see Annex 2.3). Global risk aversion is measured using the logarithm of the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index (VIX). The change in the oil price refers to the year-over-year change in the West Texas Intermediate oil price. Annex 2.3. Methodology Overall Slowdown The overall slowdown of capital flows to emerging market economies is studied in this chapter using a time series regression of average gross capital inflows to emerging markets (that is, the average gross\u0002capital-inflow-to-GDP ratio across countries) on key economic explanatory factors: emerging market– advanced economy growth and interest rate differ\u0002entials, investor risk aversion (measured using the logarithm of the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index [VIX]), the U.S. yield gap, the U.S. corporate bond spread, and the percentage change in the oil price (with seasonal dummy variables also controlled for): Kflowst = γ0 + γ1 (g - t EM – g - t AE) + γ2 (ir – t EM – ir – t AE) + γ3riskaversiont + γ4 yield gapt U.S. + γ5corp.bond spreadt U.S. + γ6∆Ptoil + ϕSt + ut , in which (g - t EM – g - t AE) and (ir – t EM – ir – t AE) are average growth and interest rate differentials, as defined later in this annex. These results are reported in Annex Table 2.3.1 for inflows and Annex Table 2.3.2 for outflows. Results are robust to using a GDP-weighted average instead of a sim\u0002ple average of capital-flow-to-GDP ratios across countries. Annex Table 2.3.1.

Not for Redistribution 88 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Cross-Country Distribution The cross-country distribution of gross capital inflows is modeled using a panel regression (with coun\u0002try fixed effects) of capital inflows on country-specific economic factors, such as country-specific forecast growth differentials relative to advanced economies, interest rate differentials, institutions, capital controls, whether the country has a large IMF loan, whether the country is in default, and percentage changes in the terms of trade (with time fixed effects controlled for): Kflowsit = θ0 + θ1 (git – g¯it AE) + θ2 (irit – ir– it AE) + θ3institutional qualityit + θ4capital controlsit + θ5IMF loanit + θ6defaultit + θ7∆termsoftradeit + τTt + εit, in which (git – g¯it AE) and (irit – ir– it AE) are growth and interest rate differentials, as defined later in this annex, and Tt are a set of quarter dummy variables. These results are reported in the first columns of Annex Table 2.3.3 for inflows and Annex Table 2.3.4 for outflows. As only the forecast growth differential is found to be statistically significant in this general regression, the specification is subsequently restricted to Kflowsit = a0 + a1 (git – g¯it AE) + βTt + eit. These results are reported in the second columns of Annex Table 2.3.3 for inflows and Annex Table 2.3.4 for outflows. Regressing gross capital inflows on the predicted values βT ^ t from this regression yields the R-squared values used in Figure 2.19. This specification is also used to examine how coun\u0002try characteristics affect the impact of the common trend for various types of countries using terms for the interactions between the time dummies and dummies for exchange rate regime, reserves, and public debt (reported in Annex Table 2.3.5 and Figure 2.20, add\u0002ing also interactions for capital controls), and the dif\u0002ferential impact of global factors, such as global growth and interest rate differentials and global risk aversion, for countries with fixed/flexible exchange rates, high/ low levels of reserves, and high/low public debt levels (as reported in Annex Table 2.3.6 and Figure 2.21). Weighting In the country-specific regressions, the (growth or interest rate) differential for emerging market i (i = 1, . . ., 20) at time t is given by the difference between the emerging market’s own growth rate and a weighted average of advanced economy growth rates (j = 1, . . ., 7): git – g¯it AE = git – Σ 7 j=1 wij gjt, with weights (varying by emerging market) wij = Σ7 j = 1PFij PFij , in which PFij is the average portfolio flow from advanced economy j to emerging market i over the years 2001–12 from the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey.

Not for Redistribution 92 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Low-income developing countries have typically been characterized by modest access to private external financing. Since the mid-2000s however, low-income developing countries have relied more on nonofficial inflows and increasingly have gained market access. Historical experience in other countries has empha\u0002sized not just the benefits of inflows—for instance, in providing financing for investment—but also the risks of inflow reversals that induce macroeconomic and financial volatility. This box documents recent experi\u0002ence with capital flows in 23 low-income developing countries, contrasting it with the 2010–15 slowdown in net capital inflows in emerging market economies.1 The box extends the data set and analysis in Araujo and others 2015 and also draws on IMF 2015a. Net capital inflows to low-income developing coun\u0002tries were broadly flat in the first half of the 2000s, with median net inflows fluctuating around 2 percent of GDP (Figure 2.1.1).2 In line with improved growth prospects in a majority of low-income developing countries, inflows picked up in the second half of the 2000s, with median net inflows peaking at 5½ percent of GDP in 2008, before retrenching during the global financial crisis. After the crisis, median net capital inflows increased sizably, from 3¼ percent of GDP in 2009 to nearly 7½ percent of GDP in 2013. However, this increasing trend was reversed sharply in 2014, with median net capital inflows to low-income developing countries falling back to the 2010 level. Thus, in contrast to the persistent 2010–15 net capital inflow slowdown in emerging market econ\u0002omies (as documented in this chapter), net capital inflows in low-income developing countries continued to expand strongly through much of the period, with a slowdown starting only in 2014. While this box does not identify the drivers behind the different capital The author of this box is Juliana D. Araujo. 1The analysis imposes a balanced-sample requirement, which limits the low-income developing country sample to 23 nonsmall and nonfragile countries, with frontier markets representing more than half of the sample: Bangladesh*, Bolivia*, Cambodia, Ghana*, Honduras, Kenya*, the Kyrgyz Republic, Lesotho, Mau\u0002ritania, Moldova, Mongolia*, Mozambique*, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria*, Papua New Guinea*, Rwanda, Senegal*, Tanzania*, Uganda*, Uzbekistan, Vietnam*, and Zambia*, where asterisks denote frontier markets as defined in IMF 2015a. Country sam\u0002ples in each figure may vary depending on data availability. 2The data exclude other investment flows to the official sector (the general government and monetary authorities), whether or not they originate from official or private sources (the underlying data source provides a breakdown by debtor but not by creditor). inflow experience of the two groups of countries, differences in their growth experiences likely played an important role. Unlike in emerging market economies, which experienced a relatively persistent growth slow\u0002down after 2010, growth in low-income developing countries remained stronger, averaging 6 percent in 2013–14. The strong growth performance was aided in part by improved macroeconomic frameworks but also by favorable external conditions (see Box 1.2).3 Since mid-2014, many commodity-dependent low-income developing countries have also seen sharply lower global commodity prices, particularly that of oil, and decelerating growth. The documented 2009–14 net capital inflow trends in low-income developing countries closely followed gross capital inflows, with outflows remaining broadly 3Several low-income developing countries also went through debt reduction programs, which started in the 1990s with bilat\u0002eral creditor debt reduction negotiations and culminated in the mid-2000s with the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and later the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.

Growth in net inflows after 2009 was broad based—nearly two-thirds of low-income developing countries received higher net capital inflows in 2013 relative to 2009. Turning to inflows by asset type, the post-2009 rise in gross capital inflows to low-income developing countries included both foreign direct investment (FDI) and non-FDI inflows (the latter comprising portfolio— debt and equity—inflows and other nonofficial investment—for example, bank deposits, corporate and bank loans, and trade credit). Furthermore, by 2012–13, the size of both FDI and non-FDI inflows, relative to GDP, for low-income developing countries exceeded inflows in emerging market economies, especially for FDI (Figure 2.1.3, panels 1 and 2, and Figure 2.1.4). Meanwhile, within non-FDI inflows, portfolio flows to low-income developing countries were very limited until 2013, with the recent increases largely driven by frontier low-income developing countries (Figure 2.1.3, panel 3). Examples of recent sovereign bond issuers include Mongolia (with a 2012 issue equivalent to 20 percent of GDP) and Kenya (with a debut issue of more than 3 percent of GDP in 2014). Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Senegal, Vietnam, and Zambia also issued sovereign bonds in 2014. Finally, net capital inflows in low-income developing countries followed similar trends in sub-Saharan Africa (corresponding to nearly half of the sample) and Asia (about a quarter of the sample), despite some recent deceleration in net capital inflows to Asian low-income developing countries (Figure 2.1.3, panel 4).4 Trends in reserve accumulation indicate that during the post-2009 period, foreign reserves have played less of a buffer role for low-income developing countries, compared with emerging market economies, with the current account counterbalancing the bulk of the net capital inflow movement. Despite the surge in net cap\u0002ital inflows, the pace of foreign reserve accumulation in low-income developing countries during 2009–13 remained broadly unchanged at about 2.6 percent of GDP (Figure 2.1.4, panel 1). During the same period, the current account balance for the median low-income developing country decreased markedly— from –6.5 to –10 percent of GDP (Figure 2.1.4, panel 2). Furthermore, in tandem with the sharp net capital 4See the April 2011 and October 2013 Regional Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa reports for an examination of capital flows to sub-Saharan Africa. inflow reversal in 2014, the current account bal\u0002ance for the median low-income developing country improved.5 In contrast, reserves played a more important buffer role prior to the global financial crisis. Net reserve accumulation peaked in 2007, with a median and top-quartile accumulation of 3¼ percent of GDP and 5Nonetheless, the interpretation of current account develop\u0002ments in countries with large investment projects financed exter\u0002nally could be more challenging. More generally, FDI-related imports could create a direct link between capital inflows and the current account balance. During 2009–14 the remain\u0002ing components (median and interquartile) of the balance of payments identity—other investment flows to the official sector, capital account balance, and net errors and omissions—remained broadly stable.

The median current account was broadly flat during that period. How have net capital inflows in low-income developing countries evolved since 2014? Preliminary evidence for the first half of 2015 for a limited sample of eight countries with available balance of payments data suggests that the reversal in net inflows contin\u0002ued in 2015 (Figure 2.1.5).

Moreover, depreciation was negligi\u0002ble in nominal effective terms. As also discussed in Box 1.2, since mid-2015, sovereign bond spreads in frontier low-income developing countries rose more sharply than those in emerging market economies. Overall, low-income developing countries have dis\u0002played strong economic resilience in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, helping insulate them from the net capital inflow slowdown observed in emerging market economies.

Box 2.1 (continued) ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 96 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO sLOW FOR TOO LONg International Monetary Fund | April 2016 In the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis, capital flows to emerging market economies were buoyed by accommodative monetary policy conditions in Europe, in Japan, and especially in the United States, as well as by substantially better growth prospects than those in the slowly recovering advanced economies. Portfolio flows represented a large part of the increase. Although this tide began to turn shortly after 2010, as documented in this chapter, a marked inflection point for many countries relates to the May 22, 2013, announcement by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke of a gradual tapering of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing program, possibly later that year. That surprise gave rise to the so-called taper tantrum––a period of several weeks during which large volumes of portfolio funds appeared to flee emerging markets, according to the emerging markets fund flows data collected by Emerging Portfolio Fund Research (EPFR) Global.1 Emerging market currencies depreci\u0002ated and emerging market asset prices generally fell. In contrast, following the actual rate liftoff on Decem\u0002ber 16, 2015, emerging market asset prices barely responded, and emerging market fund flows during the subsequent week, while negative, were not lower than the average in the previous six months.2 These two events point to the importance of changes in expectations regarding future U.S. policy interest rates in driving emerging market asset prices and asset flows in and out of emerging markets. They also illustrate how expectations of policy shifts can have distinct effects along the yield curve for U.S. Treasury bonds. The short-maturity end of the U.S. yield curve increased when the increase in the federal funds rate finally materialized in December 2015, whereas it did not move substantially during the taper tantrum (when market participants brought forward their expectations of the first rate hike, but did not The author of this box is Frantisek Ricka. 1EPFR data track net flows (investor contributions and redemptions) for individual funds and fund groups. They exclude portfolio performance and currency effects. The data are collected by EPFR Global from managers and administrators of a universe of funds covering more than $23.5 trillion in globally domiciled funds. The emerging-market-specific sample covers country-specific, regional, and general emerging market bond and equity funds. 2According to the same EPFR data, bond outflows in the week leading up to the Federal Reserve’s decision were above average, suggesting capital moved in anticipation of the rate increase. expect an imminent one). The difference in changes in the higher-maturity end of the yield curve during the two episodes, however, was far more striking. In the three weeks following May 22, 2013, 2-year and 10-year U.S. yields rose by 10 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively (they were up 20 basis points and more than 60 basis points, respectively, within five weeks after May 22, 2013). By contrast, 2-year U.S. yields were unchanged and 10-year yields were actually down 4 basis points three weeks after the December 2015 rate hike. This suggests that the anticipated policy move in December 2015 did not change the markets’ expectations regarding slow and gradual further rate increases in the coming years. Econometric analysis points to the importance of expected changes in U.S. interest rates in driving capital flows. Regression analysis reported in Table 2.2.1 helps explain the observation that the large shift in expectations of future interest rates during the taper tantrum, even in the absence of actual policy change, triggered outflows from emerging market invest\u0002ment funds whereas, with stable expectations around December 2015, the eventual rate hike did not have a meaningful short-term effect. The regression of EPFR weekly data on gross fund flows to emerging markets since the beginning of 2013 on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) (a measure of market risk aversion) and 3-, 12-, and 35-month federal funds rate futures shows that fund flows decline when markets become more risk averse (that is, the VIX is higher) and when market expectations of federal funds rates almost three years in the future increase.3 Yet the regression shows no statistically significant relationship between the 3- or 12-month future rate and emerging market fund flows. To the extent that EPFR data track approximately actual fluc\u0002tuations in total portfolio flows to emerging markets as measured by balance of payments data (Figure 2.2.1), these results suggest that longer-term market expecta\u0002tions could be more important than shorter-term rates in transmitting the effects of U.S. monetary policy to emerging market capital flows. Movements in shorter-term interest rates, which tend to be foreseen 3The estimated coefficient indicates that every percentage point increase in the expected 35-month federal funds futures rate reduces emerging market fund flows by more than $5 bil\u0002lion, suggesting a loss of at least $1 billion in fund flows during the week after the taper talk, when the 35-month future rate rose by 20 basis points.

There are important caveats to bear in mind. First, the EPFR data used in the regressions shown in Table 2.2.1 cover only a subset of portfolio flows to emerg\u0002ing markets; while such data may be useful for picking up high-frequency movements in portfolio flows in the absence of comprehensive balance of payments data for intervals shorter than a quarter, a comprehensive picture of overall capital flows to emerging markets can come only from quarterly balance of payments data. Second, at quarterly or annual frequencies, shifts in policy rate expectations can be tightly correlated with growth expectations. If so, part of the effect picked up by the coefficient on the 35-month federal funds futures rate could reflect the impact of expected economic growth in the United States. The latter, by affecting the growth differential between advanced economies and emerging markets, can be an import\u0002ant driver of capital inflows to emerging markets, consistent with the econometric results presented in this chapter. –150 –100 –50 0 50 100 150 200 2005:Q1 07:Q1 09:Q1 11:Q1 13:Q1 15:Q1 Bond and equity fund inflows (EPFR data) Total portfolio inflows (official BOP data) Figure 2.2.1.

Product market reforms deliver gains in the short term, while the impact of labor market reforms varies across types of reforms and depends on overall economic conditions. Reductions in labor tax wedges and increases in public spending on active labor market policies have larger effects during periods of slack, in part because they usually entail some degree of fiscal stimulus. In contrast, reforms to employ\u0002ment protection arrangements and unemployment benefit systems have positive effects in good times, but can become contractionary in periods of slack. These results suggest the need for carefully prioritizing and sequencing reforms. Worries have deepened over the persistent sluggish\u0002ness of growth in advanced economies since the 2008– 09 global financial crisis. The growth rate of potential output—defined as the level of output consistent with stable inflation—has declined in major advanced economies, and it is likely to remain below precrisis levels through the medium term (see Chapter 3 in the April 2015 World Economic Outlook). Although the global financial crisis was a factor in this slowdown, not least through its effect on investment, the decline in potential growth started in the early 2000s, which suggests that deeper structural factors have been at play (Figure 3.1). As a result, the continued weakness of growth and shrinking macroeconomic policy space, especially in several euro area countries and in Japan, have led policymakers to emphasize structural reforms. The hope is that such reforms will lift potential output over The authors of this chapter are Romain Duval and Davide Furceri (lead authors), Alexander Hijzen, João Jalles, and Sinem Kılıç Çelik, with contributions from Jaebin Ahn, Romain Bouis, Matteo Cac\u0002ciatore, Johannes Eugster, Giuseppe Fiori, Peter Gal, Fabio Ghironi, Prakash Loungani and Jakob Miethe, and support from Bingjie Hu, Olivia Ma, Huy Nguyen, and Rachel Szymanski.

High on the agenda are several reforms designed to strengthen the functioning of product and labor mar\u0002kets (IMF 2015; OECD 2015). Although the specifics vary widely for individual countries, these reforms broadly involve the following: • Deregulating retail trade, professional services, and certain segments of network industries (air, rail, and road transportation; electricity and gas distribution; telecommunications and postal services), primarily by reducing barriers to entry • Increasing the ability of and incentives for the non\u0002employed to find jobs, by boosting resources for and efficiency of active labor market policies, reducing the level or duration of unemployment benefits where these are particularly high, or both • Lowering the costs of and simplifying the proce\u0002dures for hiring and dismissing regular (that is, permanent) workers and harmonizing employment protection legislation for both regular and tempo\u0002rary workers • Improving collective-bargaining frameworks in instances in which they have struggled to deliver high and stable employment • Cutting the labor tax wedge—that is, the difference between the labor cost to the employer and the worker’s net take-home pay • Implementing targeted policies to boost participa\u0002tion of underrepresented groups in the labor market, including youth, women, and older workers The reforms on this menu, though highly diverse, all aim either at reducing policy distortions or at improv\u0002ing the way existing institutions address imperfections in markets. For example, governments can improve the way they provide income insurance to workers by more effectively combining unemployment benefits, employ\u0002ment protection legislation, and active labor market policies. The long-term gains that labor and product market reforms generate for advanced economies and the chan\u0002nels through which they operate (increased productivity, TIME FOR A SUPPLY-SIDE BOOST?

Not for Redistribution 102 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO SLOW FOR TOO LONG International Monetary Fund | April 2016 lower unemployment, higher labor force participation) are fairly well documented (see, for example, Bouis and Duval 2011 and the studies cited therein). Much less is known, however, about the short- to medium-term effects of such reforms on aggregate output, employ\u0002ment, and inflation. On one hand, credible structural reforms may strengthen confidence and enhance expec\u0002tations and thereby boost aggregate demand (Draghi 2015). On the other, they may further weaken demand through wage and price deflation, which can increase real interest rates in countries where monetary policy is already constrained (Eggertsson, Ferrero, and Raffo 2014; Krugman 2014). Both scenarios presume that reforms have a fairly quick and sizable impact on supply (potential output). A broader concern is that even the most effective reforms might have merely a small short-term supply benefit because of the length of time the economy needs to converge to a (higher) long-term output level (Rodrik 2015). This chapter employs new data and modeling techniques to assess whether product and labor market reforms can improve the economic outlook in advanced economies. Specifically, the chapter • Summarizes the evolution of a wide range of product market regulations and labor market structures across advanced economies over the past four decades and assesses the scope for fur\u0002ther reform • Examines the channels through which reforms affect economic activity under strong versus weak eco\u0002nomic conditions, drawing on a new model that dif\u0002ferentiates between specific regulations (for example, the costs of layoff procedures and barriers to entry), unlike other model-based studies • Applies novel empirical strategies to a new database of reforms to create a fresh quantitative assessment of their short- to medium-term macroeconomic effects, including their sensitivity to the state of the business cycle and the stance of macroeconomic policies • Considers how—in light of the findings—reforms might be sequenced and supported by other policies to maximize their potential quantitative economic benefits in the near and medium term These are the chapter’s main findings: • A number of advanced economies still have signif\u0002icant room for further deregulation in retail trade and professional services and in a few network industries. Labor market institutions are more varied across countries and are also more stable over time than are product market regulations. In some cases this stability reflects the success of several different institutional models in delivering good labor market outcomes, but in many others it highlights obstacles to reforming poorly functioning institutions and the scope for further efforts. • The product and labor market reforms considered in this chapter can make important contributions to potential output and employment levels in many advanced economies over the medium term (Table 3.1). They therefore warrant further effort, particu\u0002larly in most euro area countries and in Japan. Their contributions are likely to be modest in the short term, however, because it takes time for the benefits to materialize, particularly where economic condi\u0002tions remain weak. • Product market reforms also have some expansion\u0002ary effect in the short term. This effect does not depend markedly on overall economic conditions, but the impact on investment tends to be weaker for credit-constrained firms.

MACROECONOMIC EFFEC TS OF L ABOR AND PRODUC T MARKET REFORMS International Monetary Fund | April 2016 • The effects of labor market reforms depend on over\u0002all economic conditions: o Fiscal structural reforms in the labor market area, such as reduced labor tax wedges and increased public spending on active labor market policies, have larger effects during periods of economic slack, in part because they usually entail some degree of fiscal stimulus. o In contrast, reforms to employment protection arrangements and unemployment benefit systems have positive effects in good times, but can become contractionary in periods of slack because they can weaken aggregate demand. • However, there is no compelling evidence that reform impacts in advanced economies have been weakened in the short term by interest rates that have been at or near zero since the global financial crisis. It is unclear in theory and based on past epi\u0002sodes whether reforms have substantial deflationary (or inflationary) effects. • Complementary policies can offset the short-term costs of some structural reforms. These include supportive macroeconomic policies and intensified efforts to address weaknesses in bank and corporate balance sheets—for example, through stronger cor\u0002porate insolvency frameworks and the development of distressed debt markets by improving market infrastructure and using asset management compa\u0002nies to jump-start the market in some cases (Aiyar and others 2015). These results suggest that prioritizing and sequenc\u0002ing reforms can be particularly important for opti\u0002mizing their impact in the current environment of persistent slack in most advanced economies. Reforms that entail fiscal stimulus will be the most valuable, including reducing labor tax wedges and increasing public spending on active labor market policies. Such measures will also remain effective when implemented in a budget-neutral way, for example, as part of broad tax and spending reforms. Product market reforms should also be prioritized, because they boost output regardless of overall economic conditions and because they do not weigh on public finances. Other labor market reforms could be costly in the short term under current conditions, includ\u0002ing reductions in unemployment benefits and— especially—reform of job protection rules. One strategy could be to enact such measures with a cred\u0002ible proviso that they will come into force only when the recovery is more robust. Such an approach could induce firms to invest and hire prospectively, in advance of the actual implementation of the reforms. Grandfathering reforms—that is, applying new rules only to new beneficiaries (of permanent job contracts or unemployment benefits) and exempt\u0002ing current beneficiaries—is an alternative, possibly easier-to-implement way to achieve the same goal. Another common concern with these labor market reforms is that they may increase income inequality. Preliminary analysis does not point to significant distributional consequences of the reforms studied in this chapter, with the exception of reductions in unemployment benefits, which appear to raise inequality over the medium term. This possibility provides a case for strengthening job search support and incentives without cutting benefits, or at least for complementing benefit reforms with offsetting fiscal measures targeted at lower-income households. There is also a case for fiscal rules that accommo\u0002date structural reforms, especially in periods of weak Table 3.1. Effect of Product and Labor Market Reforms on Macroeconomic Outcomes The effects of structural reforms depend on the type of reform, overall economic conditions, and the horizon considered.

Not for Redistribution 104 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO SLOW FOR TOO LONG International Monetary Fund | April 2016 economic conditions. Expansionary fiscal policy can offset the short-term costs of certain reforms (for example, to employment protection legislation) and amplify the gains from others (for example, from tax wedge reductions or increased spending on active labor market policies) (see also Chapter 2 in the October 2014 Fiscal Monitor). Thus, in countries that have a credible medium-term fiscal framework and available fiscal space, it could be beneficial to use fiscal policy to advance the implementation of reforms while com\u0002mitting to tightening later, when fiscal consolidation becomes less costly. This strategy could facilitate the adoption of reforms while amplifying their payoff over the medium term. Given the uncertain effects of product and labor market reforms on prices, and amid persistent low inflation in many countries, strong and credible monetary policy frameworks that keep medium-term inflation expectations anchored and ease the zero\u0002lower-bound constraint on policy rates—including quantitative easing or negative deposit rates, where relevant—can preempt the risk that reforms will lead to deflation, increase the real interest rate, and lower aggregate demand. The policy prescriptions in this chapter represent a first-best strategy to maximize the impact of reforms in the current environment of persistent slack, but it may not always be feasible to implement them. For example, binding macroeconomic policy con\u0002straints may sometimes rule out demand support for labor market reforms even under weak macroeco\u0002nomic conditions. Likewise, in some cases political economy constraints may call for pursuing difficult reforms when there is a window of opportunity— such as during periods of protracted slow growth. In such cases, reforms are pursued for their long-term benefits, but expectations regarding their short-term impact should be realistic. Finally, despite the clear benefits, reforms in product and labor markets alone cannot counteract the per\u0002sistent decline in potential growth that started in the early 2000s and was amplified by the global financial crisis. Past reforms have reduced the scope for further progress in some areas, and the empirical evidence in this chapter suggests that the impact of reforms eventually levels off. Product and labor market reforms should therefore be combined with complementary actions in other areas, including education, innova\u0002tion, and tax and spending policies (April 2016 Fiscal Monitor, Chapter 2). The Economics of Product and Labor Market Reforms: A Primer Product and labor market reforms are motivated by multiple public policy objectives. They can raise long-term output by boosting productivity, investment, and employment. They may affect income inequality by changing the distribution of jobs, market wages, and nonwage income (social benefits and taxes). Public finances and debt sustainability may also depend on reforms, including through effects on long-term output. Reforms that increase the responsiveness of wages and prices to business conditions can promote microeco\u0002nomic efficiency while enhancing economic resilience by smoothing adjustment to macroeconomic shocks. This chapter focuses on how various product and labor market reforms affect macroeconomic outcomes, particularly output and employment. Reforms can be classified according to the nature of their impact: • Reforms that enhance productivity—In theory, pro\u0002competitive product market reforms boost growth by lowering the prices that firms charge consumers, by improving the use and allocation of labor and capital across firms, and by enhancing firms’ incentives to invest, absorb cutting-edge technologies, and inno\u0002vate. Such reforms include, in particular, measures aimed at facilitating new firms’ access to markets, lowering the administrative burden on corporations, and easing barriers to foreign direct investment and trade. Advanced economies have made major progress in all of these areas over the past two decades—for instance, in deregulating network industries (Figure 3.2). Nonetheless, there remains scope for further progress in many European countries as well as in Japan and Korea (Koske and others 2015). Although the specifics vary from country to country, there are opportunities to further strengthen competition in nontradables industries, including in some network industry segments, as well as in retail trade and professional services, where significant and rather stable barriers to entry remain in some countries (for example, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain). Reform of employment protection systems may also boost productivity by enhancing resource (re)allocation across firms and industries (Bassanini, Nunziata, and Venn 2009). Other important productivity-enhancing reforms that are beyond the scope of this chapter involve strengthening innovation policies and education systems, as well as altering tax and spending policies (see Chapter 2 in the April 2016 Fiscal Monitor). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 105 CHAPTER 3 TIME FOR A SUPPLY-SIDE BOOST? MACROECONOMIC EFFEC TS OF L ABOR AND PRODUC T MARKET REFORMS International Monetary Fund | April 2016 • Reforms that lower structural unemployment—Eco\u0002nomic theory suggests that easing barriers to entry into product markets, reducing the level or duration of unemployment benefits where particularly high, strengthening active labor market policies, and low\u0002ering labor tax wedges can all reduce unemployment over the long term by increasing the demand for labor, unemployed workers’ ability and incentives to find jobs, or both (Blanchard and Giavazzi 2003; Nickell and Layard 1999; Pissarides 2000). Easing employ\u0002ment protection legislation enhances the relative job prospects of underrepresented groups, such as low\u0002skilled youth and migrants, in the labor market, but it can have an unpredictable impact on aggregate unem\u0002ployment, since it increases incentives both to hire and to dismiss workers. Reforms in this area may also have different effects depending on their design, such as whether they apply to regular or temporary jobs (for example, Blanchard and Landier 2002). Labor market regulations are much more stable over time than are product market regulations—with the exception of some widespread relaxation of employment protection for temporary workers; to a lesser extent, they also vary more across countries (Figure 3.3). The stability of labor market institutions within countries and their variability across countries partly reflect political economy factors that so far have impeded the reform of poorly functioning institutions (Box 3.1). However, they also illustrate that societal preferences vary (for example, over economic risk) and that different insti\u0002tutional models can be effective in accommodating those preferences (for example, Blanchard, Jaumotte, and Loungani 2014). For instance, despite some cuts in benefits since the early 1990s, Nordic countries have maintained comparatively generous unemploy\u0002ment insurance systems while relying extensively on active labor market policies to reduce unemploy\u0002ment (OECD 2006). Likewise, different collective wage-bargaining systems may deliver high and stable employment, provided they ensure that wages ade\u0002quately reflect business conditions (Box 3.2). More broadly, experience suggests that both “Anglo-Saxon” and “Nordic” models can deliver high employment rates (OECD 2006; Sapir 2006). • Reforms that raise the participation of underrepre\u0002sented groups in the labor market—Despite some convergence, the fact that women, youth, low\u0002skilled migrants, and older workers continue to display widely different participation rates across countries contributes to cross-country differences 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1975 80 85 90 95 2000 05 10 13 1.

Not for Redistribution 106 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO SLOW FOR TOO LONG International Monetary Fund | April 2016 in overall employment rates and suggests that there is scope for improving current policies. Options for encouraging more women to enter the labor force include reducing the (marginal) income taxation of second earners, enhancing the availability and reducing the cost of child care, and promoting pol\u0002icies that improve work-life balance—for instance, expanded scope and incentives for part-time work and parental leave (for example, Jaumotte 2003). Among the policies that can strengthen the labor participation of youth and low-skilled migrants are targeted active labor market policies (such as training programs), combined with demand-side policies that create job opportunities, such as lower tax wedges and youth-specific minimum wages. For older workers, it is important to reduce incentives for early retirement, not least by lowering the implicit taxation on continued work often embed\u0002ded in old-age pension systems—for example, when bonuses (penalties) for deferred (anticipated) retirement are too weak (Stock and Wise 1990)— but also by limiting the extent to which other social welfare programs can be used as pathways into early retirement (Duval 2003). The short- to medium-term effects of these product and labor market reforms are more uncertain and are likely to vary widely depending on how they affect cur\u0002rent aggregate demand and supply. If demand increases (declines) more than supply, overall use of domestic resources may increase (decrease), and inflation may rise (decline) as a result. This depends, in turn, on how reforms influence expectations (through their credibility and communication), wages and income distribution, the strength of the external competitiveness channel, and income and job security (actual or perceived). Transitory costs also matter. Employment protection reform may trigger immediate layoffs—especially in bad economic times—whereas hiring can take more time. Product market deregulation may lead to rapid down\u0002sizing or exit of incumbent firms but only gradual new firm entry, for example, in some network industries in which it can take time to build a network and a cus\u0002tomer base. Finally, the short- to medium-term impact of reform can be shaped by macroeconomic policies. The Macroeconomic Effects of Reforms: A Model-Based Analysis This section looks at the macroeconomic effects of reforms using a new dynamic general equilibrium model that incorporates key features of product and labor market regulation (see Annex 3.1 for details and Cacciatore and others, forthcoming-b). This model offers some key benefits: it helps shed light on the transmission channels through which reforms affect economic activity, and it addresses relevant policy issues that cannot be fully explored in the empiri\u0002cal analysis—such as how the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates affects the short-term impact of reforms and the immediate impact of credible announcements of future reforms.

MACROECONOMIC EFFEC TS OF L ABOR AND PRODUC T MARKET REFORMS International Monetary Fund | April 2016 among, a broad range of specific product and labor market policies, and (2) it features some real-world imperfections in product and labor markets, such as irreversible (regulatory and other) investment costs that new firms have to pay when entering the market and job-search-and-matching frictions in the labor market that make job creation a gradual and costly process. The analysis uses the model to explore the impact of four types of product and labor market reforms: low\u0002ering anticompetitive barriers to entry in nontradables sectors, reducing administrative costs of firing proce\u0002dures, cutting the levels or duration of unemployment benefits, and strengthening active labor market policies that more efficiently match prospective workers to job openings. Reforms can be carried out in three distinct macroeconomic environments: 1. Normal times—that is, normal business conditions 2. Bad times with unconstrained monetary policy—that is, assuming that the policy rate could go below zero, or equivalently, that quantitative easing could in practice fully relax the zero-lower-bound constraint 3. Bad times with constrained monetary policy—that is, a combination of major slack in the economy, driven by a large adverse demand shock, and a binding zero lower bound on the monetary policy rate.1 The analysis highlights what difference the macroeco\u0002nomic environment makes for the effect of different reforms. Short- and Long-Term Effects of Reforms All four types of reforms studied here increase the level of output in the long term by raising productivity, employment levels, or both. For instance, in an illustra\u0002tive reform scenario for the euro area as a whole, joint implementation of the four types of reforms would increase the level of output by about 4 percent and reduce the unemployment rate by about 2½ percentage points in the long term. Product market reforms would account for approximately half of the overall output gain, with increased producer entry boosting job cre\u0002ation and the economy also benefiting from decreased 1Although this chapter focuses on a model calibrated for the euro area, the key insights of the analysis apply to advanced economies more broadly. Alternative versions of the model, such as for a small open economy operating either a flexible or a fixed exchange rate regime, yield qualitatively similar implications—although the quan\u0002titative effects of reforms can differ. See related work by Cacciatore and others (2015). spending on wasteful regulatory costs. These beneficial effects do not factor in any additional productivity gains that may stem from reduced inefficiency among incum\u0002bent firms (the so-called X-inefficiency) or from stronger incentives for them to innovate. Although the types of reforms considered here unam\u0002biguously raise output over the long term, they pay off only gradually, and some can entail short-term costs. Gains materialize as new firms start producing and new workers are hired, both of which occur only gradually. By contrast, some reforms can trigger quick downsizing of incumbent firms and dismissal of workers. In particular, in the model-based analysis, easing employment protec\u0002tions induces firms to dismiss relatively less productive workers immediately, whereas its positive impact on hiring incentives creates jobs only gradually. As a result, unemployment increases, aggregate demand declines, and output contracts for a time (Figure 3.4, panels 1 and 2). Lowering entry barriers in nontradables sectors initially boosts demand by triggering entry of new firms, which demand intermediate goods and ultimately labor and capital, but subsequent downsizing of incumbents more than offsets these new firms’ (expansionary) contributions to aggregate output, leading to net job and output losses overall in the short term (Figure 3.4, panels 3 and 4).2 Unemployment benefit reforms have ambiguous short-term effects. The model-based analysis finds positive short-term effects because reduced unemploy\u0002ment benefits boost hiring by lowering wages, while firing is basically unaffected. However, the model abstracts from a potential counteracting force: a cut in unemployment benefits often disproportionately affects lower-income workers who face credit constraints, inducing them to curtail consumption. Even if the government fully redistributes the fiscal gain from ben\u0002efit reductions through broad-based tax cuts, aggregate consumption may still decline and output fall (see, for instance, Kollmann and others 2015). Likewise, the short-term impact of active labor market policy reforms depends on two conflicting effects. By increasing workers’ incentives to look for and accept job offers, such reforms boost job creation. But by making it easier for firms to find new workers, they also provide an incentive to lay off relatively less productive workers. 2The analysis here focuses on barriers to entry, which offer the greatest scope for reform in most countries. However, other types of product market reforms, such as reductions in administrative burdens on existing corporations, may yield more immediate gains by reducing fixed costs of production. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 108 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO SLOW FOR TOO LONG International Monetary Fund | April 2016 The Role of Macroeconomic Conditions Not only can the types of reforms considered here entail short-term costs, but their short-term effects can also be very different if the reforms are imple\u0002mented in bad times rather than in normal times. In particular, employment protection legislation reforms are more contractionary in the short term when there is substantial economic slack—even when the mon\u0002etary policy response is unconstrained (Figure 3.4, panels 1 and 2). Firms seek to dismiss more workers in bad times than in normal times, but stringent job protections partly discourage them from doing so. Relaxing the constraint imposed by such protections benefits individual firms taken in isolation. But by triggering a wave of layoffs, reforming employment protections further weakens aggregate demand and delays economic recovery. To a lesser extent, prod\u0002uct market reforms also have a weaker short-term impact in bad times compared with normal times (Figure 3.4, panels 3 and 4), although the differ\u0002ence is small, as higher profit margins per firm due to fewer competing firms under adverse macroeco\u0002nomic conditions offset lower expected profits among prospective entrants. In addition, binding external financial constraints—not considered in the analysis here—that prevent new firms from financing invest\u0002ment can make product market reforms substantially more contractionary in the short term (Cacciatore and others, forthcoming-a). This suggests that easing external borrowing constraints—on firms and the economy as a whole—may enhance the short-term effect of product market deregulation. Unemployment benefit reforms can have either stron\u0002ger or weaker short-term effects in bad economic times, depending on various factors. On one hand, the mod\u0002el-based analysis highlights that a sizable pool of unem\u0002ployed workers makes it easier for firms to recruit, and job creation responds more strongly to the reduction in wages brought about by a cut in benefits. This larger employment gain from unemployment benefit reforms in bad times contrasts with the larger job losses observed following a relaxation of employment protections and illustrates the broader point that wage flexibility may be more desirable than employment flexibility in bad times (see, for example, Boeri and Jimeno 2015).3 On the other hand, in periods of economic slack, a reduction in benefits may have a larger adverse effect than in normal times through fiscal multipliers, which tend to be larger in general during recessions (Auerbach and Gorod\u0002nichenko 2012; Blanchard and Leigh 2013; Jordà and Taylor 2013; Abiad, Furceri, and Topalova 2015), and this may hold true particularly for changes in unem\u0002ployment benefits, because households also become more credit constrained during downturns (Mian and Sufi 2010).4 In addition, a cut in benefits tends to have 3Boeri and Jimeno (2015) also argue that high minimum wages for underrepresented groups in the labor market may have higher employment costs in recessions. 4The argument could still hold even if reform were implemented in a budget-neutral way, insofar as changes in unemployment benefits entail a higher fiscal multiplier than do offsetting tax cuts (spending increases).

Selected Model Results Employment protection legislation and product market reforms raise output over the long term, but they pay off only gradually and can entail short-term costs, particularly in bad times.

MACROECONOMIC EFFEC TS OF L ABOR AND PRODUC T MARKET REFORMS International Monetary Fund | April 2016 a larger effect in recessions on (non-credit-constrained) households’ incentives to reduce consumption in favor of precautionary saving, as their ability to insure them\u0002selves declines and their risk of idiosyncratic income loss increases.5 One way to alleviate the short-term cost of some labor market reforms—especially in bad times—is to announce credibly that they will be implemented only when the economic recovery is more solid, for instance, by passing a law that sets a future date for entry into force.6 In particular, announcing future employment protection legislation reforms immediately boosts firms’ hiring incentives in anticipation of lower future costs of layoff procedures, without inducing them to dismiss more workers in the short term, while the existing rules still apply. By contrast, such a strat\u0002egy may not be so helpful when applied to product market reforms in bad times. For example, announcing a future reduction of entry barriers encourages new firms to postpone entry and investment until entry costs are effectively lowered, while encouraging incum\u0002bent firms to start downsizing immediately in anticipa\u0002tion of stronger future competition. The Role of Constraints on Monetary Policy Whether constraints on monetary policy, including the zero lower bound, influence the short-term effects of reforms depends on the relative short-term effect of these reforms on demand and supply and therefore their net effect on inflation and the real interest rate. The results of the model suggest that constraints on monetary policy may have limited effects in shaping the short-term impact of reforms, as these reforms have little or no deflationary effect (Figure 3.4). For exam\u0002ple, although relaxing employment protections puts strengthen the response of individual job search, and therefore of job matching, to changes in benefits (Chetty 2008). 5The analysis of the impact of benefit reforms in bad versus normal times also bears some connection to the unsettled debate regarding whether unemployment insurance should be made more or less generous in recessions (see, for example, Landais, Michaillat, and Saez 2015 and Mitman and Rabinovich 2015). The answer depends not only on the short-term impact of changes in benefits, but also on the value of income insurance for workers, which is likely to be greater in recessions—an issue that is not taken into account in the analysis here. 6Grandfathering reforms may also help on this front. In particular, grandfathering employment protection legislation increases incen\u0002tives for firms to create jobs—since all new contracts are subject to the new, less stringent rules—without changing their incentives to lay off existing workers. Examples include the 2015 employment protection legislation reform in Italy and some provisions of the 2012 reform in Spain. downward pressure on inflation by weakening aggre\u0002gate demand in the short term, the immediate positive impact of the reform on productivity, and thereby on bargained wages, offsets this effect.7 As for product market deregulation, reducing entry barriers may be more beneficial at the zero lower bound because, unlike in normal times, monetary tightening does not offset the short-term increase in demand—and therefore in marginal costs and inflation—created by the additional investment and job creation undertaken by new firms that enter the market (Figure 3.4, panels 3 and 4).8 As noted earlier, product market reform can also lead to immediate productivity gains by inducing incumbent firms to eliminate existing inefficiencies. Such a reform\u0002driven productivity increase—not considered in the analysis here—would be expansionary even in the short term under all three alternative macroeconomic condi\u0002tions studied here, but this particular channel of reform would have a milder impact when the economy is at the zero lower bound. The reason is that higher productivity, other things being equal, immediately boosts supply, lowering inflation and thus raising real interest rates. The Macroeconomic Effects of Reforms: An Empirical Analysis This section quantifies empirically the macroeco\u0002nomic effects of reforms and examines whether the data align with the theoretical considerations discussed in the previous sections. In contrast to a large body of liter\u0002ature that focuses on estimating the long-term impact of policies and institutions on economic activity, this chapter adopts a novel empirical strategy that allows estimation of both the short- and medium-term effects of product and labor market reforms on a range of mac\u0002roeconomic outcomes. Specifically, it identifies major policy changes in the areas of product market regula\u0002tion, employment protection legislation, unemployment benefits, active labor market policies, and labor taxation, and then traces the evolution of output, (un)employ\u0002ment, and inflation in the aftermath of these reforms.9 7For an alternative theoretical analysis applied to Japan’s labor market, see Porcellacchia 2016. 8Using a similar setup but without focusing on the zero-lower\u0002bound issue, Cacciatore, Fiori, and Ghironi (forthcoming) show that an expansionary monetary policy stance can smooth transition costs and contribute to front-loading the long-term benefits of reforms. 9Complementary analysis was carried out to assess the effects of these reforms on income inequality, as measured by Gini coefficients. No statistically significant effects were found, with the exception of ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 110 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO SLOW FOR TOO LONG International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Major reforms are identified primarily by examining documented legislative and regulatory actions reported in all available issues of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Economic Survey for advanced economies since 1970, as well as additional country-specific sources. In this respect, the methodology is closely related to the “narrative approach” used to identify monetary and fiscal shocks and periods of high financial distress by Romer and Romer (1989, 2004, 2010, 2015) and Devries and others (2011). The approach considers both reforms and “counterreforms”— that is, policy changes in the opposite direction. These major policy shifts are identified as those legislative or regulatory changes for which at least one of the following three conditions is satisfied: (1) the OECD survey uses strong nor\u0002mative language, suggestive of an important measure (for example, “major reform”), to describe the change; (2) the policy action is mentioned repeatedly across various issues of the OECD survey or in retrospective summaries of key past reforms for the country con\u0002sidered; or (3) the OECD indicator of the regulatory stance in the area considered—if available—displays a very large change. When only the last of these condi\u0002tions is met, an extensive search through other sources is performed to identify the precise policy action underpinning the change in the indicator.10 The main advantage of this approach is that it identi\u0002fies the precise nature and timing of significant legisla\u0002tive and regulatory actions taken by advanced economies since the early 1970s in all key labor and product mar\u0002ket policy areas, including some for which no time-vary\u0002ing indicators exist (for example, regarding conditions for receipt of unemployment benefits or the design of active labor market policies, such as integration of job placement and benefit payment services). These four major gains (nature and timing of policy actions, cov\u0002erage length and breadth) allow for a richer and more granular analysis of the short- to medium-term effects of reforms than in past studies. This approach, along with others used in the literature on this topic, has three main shortcomings, however. First, the identified events may themselves be driven by macroeconomic outcomes and may coincide with reforms in other areas—issues that are addressed in the empirical analysis. Second, two reductions in unemployment benefits, which are associated with an increase in inequality over the medium term. 10See Annex 3.2 for details on the criteria and procedure employed to identify major reform episodes using the accounts in the OECD Economic Survey, as well as for examples of reforms. large reforms in a given area (for example, employment protection legislation) can involve different specific actions (for example, a major simplification of the pro\u0002cedures for individual and collective dismissals, respec\u0002tively). As a result, only the average historical impact of reforms can be estimated. Third, the database provides no information regarding the stance of current (or past) product and labor market regulations and as such is not a substitute for existing policy indicators, such as, for instance, those the OECD produces. Finally, the approach does not rely on a common single metric to identify reforms, unlike some earlier studies that relied on changes in OECD product and labor market indicators to identify reform episodes (Bouis and others 2012; Bordon, Ebeke, and Shirono, 2016). The results presented in the chapter are robust to using this methodology, even though the effects of reforms are weaker and less precisely estimated com\u0002pared with the narrative approach—suggesting that the latter better identifies major reform events and thereby reduces measurement error. Once major policy actions are identified, their short- and medium-term impact on economic activity is quantified using two econometric specifications. The first establishes whether reforms have statistically significant effects on macroeconomic variables such as output, (un)employment, and inflation. The second assesses whether these effects vary with overall business conditions prevailing at the time of the reform (weak versus strong economic conditions) or with the stance of accompanying macroeconomic policies—that is, whether the effects of reforms differ between periods of fiscal expansion and fiscal contraction (see Annex 3.3 for details).11 To provide additional insights into the 11The baseline specifications control for past economic growth, past reforms, and recessions dummies as well as country and time fixed effects. A possible concern regarding the analysis is that the probability of structural reform is influenced not only by past eco\u0002nomic growth and the occurrence of recessions (Box 3.1), but also by contemporaneous economic developments as well as expectations of future growth. However, this is unlikely to be a major issue, given the long lags associated with the implementation of structural reforms and the likelihood that information about future growth is largely embedded in past economic activity. Most important, controlling for expectations of current and future growth delivers results that are very similar to, and not different with statistical significance from, those reported in this chapter. Another possible concern regarding the analysis is that the results may suffer from omitted-variables bias, as reforms may occur across different markets at the same time. However, including all the reforms simultane\u0002ously in the estimated equation does not substantially alter the magnitude and the statistical significance of the results.

Product Market Reforms This subsection focuses on the effects of product market reforms aimed at reducing domestic barriers to competition. Although this issue is high on policy\u0002makers’ current structural reform agenda, other related policies, including those directed at easing barriers to international trade and foreign direct investment, also have the potential to boost productivity and output levels (Box 3.3). Macro Analysis The analysis here shows that product market reforms have statistically significant medium-term output effects.12 A major liberalization event, such as, for example, the deregulation of several network industries in Germany in 1998, leads to a statistically significant increase in the output level of about 1½ percent four years after the reform (Figure 3.5, panel 1). The effect eventually levels off, after seven years, at about 2¼ percent. In addition, the point estimates suggest that product market reforms increase employment levels and decrease price levels, though the wide confidence intervals associated with the estimates imply that these effects are not statistically distinguishable from zero (Figure 3.5, panels 2 and 3). The macroeconomic effects of product market reforms are not statistically significantly weaker under adverse business conditions—though the point esti\u0002mates suggest smaller effects—but employment (and output) effects are significantly larger where employ\u0002ment protection regulations are more stringent.13 This controlling for countrywide economic conditions and, in some cases, using instrumental variables. Such analyses yield results that are qualitatively similar to those from the macroeconomic analysis. See the discussion later in the chapter as well as Annex 3.3 for details. 12The macroeconomic analysis focuses on major past reforms across network industries. Qualitatively similar results are obtained for broader reforms identified as major legislative changes aimed at improving overall product market competition. 13These results may be driven by the fact that in the sample used here, major product market reforms occur in countries with strong employment protection regulation. However, no statistically signif\u0002icant correlation is found between the probability of major product finding is consistent with previous theory and empiri\u0002cal evidence (Blanchard and Giavazzi 2003; Fiori and others 2012). The intuition is that in countries with more stringent employment protection legislation, real wages are more likely to exceed levels that clear the labor market and to leave employment below the full-employment level. In such countries, product mar\u0002ket reform has greater potential to deliver job gains.14 Sector-Level Analysis The macroeconomic effects of product market reforms identified in the macro analysis reflect not only the direct impact of deregulation in the industries considered, but also its indirect impact through two kinds of spillovers to other sectors. First, product market reforms in upstream industries (for instance, network industries, banking, professional services) can reduce the price and improve the quality and variety of the intermediate inputs used by downstream sectors (for instance, manufacturing), thereby boosting productivity and competitiveness in these sectors (backward linkages). Moreover, lower prices for intermediate inputs may increase profits, and therefore incentives to innovate, in downstream sectors.15 Second, product market reforms raise output in the affected sectors, increasing their demand for intermediate inputs from upstream sectors (forward linkages). For example, deregulation in the electricity sector may positively affect other sectors by both reducing their costs of production (backward linkage) and requiring more inputs from these sectors (forward linkage). Sector-level analysis shows that product market reforms in network sectors have statistically significant direct and indirect medium-term effects on output. On average, output in the sector affected by a partic\u0002ular reform increases by more than 10 percent four years after the reform, although this impact takes market reforms and the degree of employment protection regulation. In addition, the analysis controls for the degree of current and past employment protection regulation. 14This result should not necessarily be interpreted as lack of com\u0002plementarity among structural reforms in general. Indeed, the case studies presented in Box 3.4 point to potential benefits from broad packages of reforms. 15For discussion and empirical evidence regarding the impact of reform through backward linkages, see Bourlès and others 2013 and Cette, Lopez, and Mairesse, forthcoming. Theoretically, competition has an ambiguous effect on innovation. Although some models of endogenous technological change would predict that competition curbs innovation (Aghion and Howitt 1992), more recent models predict positive or hump-shaped effects of competition on innova\u0002tion (Aghion and others 2001; Aghion and Schankerman 2004). ©International Monetary Fund.

Furthermore, productivity increases, and the (relative) price level falls. In addition to these direct effects, product market reforms in network sectors have statistically significant indirect medium-term effects on output in other sectors. A major reform in one of the network sectors increases output in downstream and upstream sectors by, on average, about 0.3 percent four years after the reform (Figure 3.6, panels 2 and 3). Firm-Level Analysis To provide additional insights into the effects of product market reforms and the channels through which they operate, the analysis examines how their effects vary across different types of firms in different sectors, depending on firm characteristics such as their size and financial health and needs. The results of the analysis suggest that product market reforms have statistically significant positive effects on incumbent firms, whose output (sales) increases by about 2 per\u0002cent in the first year and by about 3 percent three years after the reform (Figure 3.7, panel 1).17 Furthermore, reforms have statistically significant medium-term effects on employment and capital, which increase by about 1½ and 3 percent, respectively (Figure 3.7, panels 2 and 3). The output effects of reforms in retail trade and professional services are comparable to those in network industries (Figure 3.7, panels 4–6). This finding suggests that the output effects estimated in the macro- and sector-level analyses for network industries may to a large extent be generalized to reforms in other key areas. Moreover, the comparable magnitudes of the (direct) medium-term effects on output estimated in the firm- and sector-level analyses tentatively suggest years; and (3) the issuance of a new European Union directive since the last reform was implemented. Dabla-Norris and others (2015) also find that product market reforms have a positive impact on output—via higher productiv\u0002ity—that increases over time. In contrast, no statistically significant employment effects are found in the deregulated sectors, in line with the results from the macroeconomic analysis. Bassanini (2015) finds a negative short-term impact of deregulation in network industries. 17Given the shorter time sample of firm-level data compared with macro- and sector-level data, the analysis examines the effect of reforms on firms’ economic activity up to three years after the reform (see Annex 3.3 for a detailed description of the data and sources). –5.0 –4.0 –3.0 –2.0 –1.0 0.0 1.0 –1 0 1 2 3 4 –1.5 –1.0 –0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 –1 0 1 2 3 4 –1.0 –0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 –1 0 1 2 3 4 1.

MACROECONOMIC EFFEC TS OF L ABOR AND PRODUC T MARKET REFORMS International Monetary Fund | April 2016 that the positive effect on incumbent firms’ output contributes more to the response of sectoral output to reforms than do firms’ entry and exit—although the response of incumbent firms is itself triggered largely by increased competition from potential new entrants.18 Whereas output effects are similar across sectors and firms, employment effects vary with firm size (Figure 3.8). In particular, the employment effect of reforms tends to be larger for smaller firms in network sectors, and to a lesser extent in professional services, and larger for larger firms in retail trade.19 This reflects differences in produc\u0002tion technology and the nature of regulation between these sectors. Network industries tend to be dominated by a rather small number of large firms that scale back employment and investment plans when reforms improve potential entrants’ access to the network. By contrast, firms in retail trade tend to be relatively small and labor intensive; when reforms remove restrictions specific to large firms, these large firms benefit.20 Product market reforms also have a varied effect across firms depending on the firms’ financial health and needs. The medium-term impact of reforms on investment among firms with low debt is about four times larger (about 20 percent) than it is among highly indebted firms (about 5 percent) (Figure 3.9, panels 1 and 2).21 In addition, when credit conditions are tight across the economy, firms that depend heavily on exter\u0002nal financing invest considerably less following a major product market reform than firms that do not (Figure 3.9, panels 3 and 4).22 These results further strengthen 18Comparisons between firm- and sector-level and macro analyses should be treated with caution. First, the firm-level analysis here is restricted to incumbent firms that remain in business. While product market reforms have potentially important effects on the entry and exit of firms, the current data set does not allow those dynam\u0002ics to be analyzed with confidence. Second, firm-level results are unweighted. This means that they capture the average firms’ response rather than the population-weighted aggregate response. Finally, the sample does not cover all firms and industries equally well. 19Note that these results are unweighted and that weighting should reduce the estimated effect of product market reforms in network industries, given the predominance of large firms in these sectors. 20Another key regulation in retail trade addresses the flexibility of shop opening hours and prices. Regulation in professional services relates to barriers to entry and the way services are delivered and includes, among other things, rules governing the recognition of qualifications and the determination of fees and prices. 21In an effort to isolate the role of credit constraints that may be associated with high levels of indebtedness from the confounding role of credit demand, the debt ratios are held constant over time. 22The analysis makes use of a triple-differences approach, building on previous work by Rajan and Zingales (1998), which focuses on the differential effects of product market reforms among firms in –0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 –1 0 1 2 3 4 –0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 –1 0 1 2 3 4 –0.4 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0 –1 0 1 2 3 4 1.

MACROECONOMIC EFFEC TS OF L ABOR AND PRODUC T MARKET REFORMS International Monetary Fund | April 2016 the case for policies aimed at addressing weak bank and corporate balance sheets, as these may enhance the investment impact of product market reforms. Labor Market Reforms This subsection focuses on the effects of reforms of employment protection legislation for regular (perma\u0002nent) workers, unemployment benefits, active labor market policies, and labor taxation. In addition to these policies, collective-bargaining systems also matter for high and stable employment (see Box 3.2). Employment Protection Legislation The analysis shows that reforms that ease dismissal regulations with respect to regular workers (such as, for instance, those in Spain in the mid-1990s or Austria in 2003) do not have, on average, statistically signifi\u0002cant effects on employment and other macroeconomic variables. A look behind the average effects shows, however, that the impacts vary markedly according to overall business conditions. When economic conditions are strong, reforms have a sizable positive impact on output and employment, whereas the impact becomes contractionary if the reforms are undertaken during periods of slack (Figure 3.10, panels 1–4). In addition, the estimates suggest that in bad times, reform of employment protection legislation may reduce infla\u0002tion in the short and medium term, though the wide confidence intervals associated with the results imply that these estimates are not statistically significantly different from zero (Figure 3.10, panels 5 and 6). As discussed in the chapter’s theoretical section, a poten\u0002tial reason for this asymmetric effect across different economic regimes is that whereas in periods of strong economic activity, these reforms may stimulate hiring by reducing the cost of future dismissals, in periods of slack they may trigger immediate layoffs. Another potential mechanism behind the limited average macroeconomic impact of employment protec\u0002tion legislation reforms could be that the effect varies industries that are heavily dependent on external financing in periods in which credit supply is constrained and those in which credit is readily available. External dependence is measured by the ratio to capital expenditure of the difference between capital expenditure and cash flows. Firms’ intrinsic dependence on external credit is measured by the average level of external dependence in the firms’ industry across the United Kingdom and the United States. Credit conditions are measured using the regime-switching method— described in Annex 3.3—applied to credit growth in each country. The analysis is limited to network industries. across economic sectors, depending on how binding the regulations are in each sector. Specifically, stringent regu\u0002lations governing dismissal are likely to be more binding in sectors that are characterized by a higher “natural” propensity to adjust their workforce to idiosyncratic shocks.23 Reforms to employment protection legislation 23An example of a sector among those with highest natural layoff rates is construction; one of those with the lowest layoff rates is electricity and gas. –5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 –1 0 1 2 1.

Solid lines denote the response to a major reform in product market regulation, and dashed lines denote 90 percent confidence bands. External dependence is defined as the difference between capital expenditure and cash flows as a share of capital expenditure. This measure is then averaged across firms over time and across countries within each industry. Only data from the United Kingdom and United States are used for the calculation of this measure. This definition is based on Rajan and Zingales 1998. Under high and low credit growth, respectively, panels 3 and 4 show the difference in the investment response to reform between firms in sectors that depend strongly on external financing and firms in sectors that depend weakly on external financing. The effect of product market reforms on investment tends to be weaker for firms with high debt and for firms that depend heavily on external financing during periods of tight credit conditions.

Not for Redistribution 116 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO SLOW FOR TOO LONG International Monetary Fund | April 2016 could then lead to reallocation of workers away from sectors in which regulations are less binding toward those in which regulations are more binding and could thus result in small aggregate employment effects. To test this hypothesis, and also as a robustness check for the economy-wide results presented earlier, the analysis looks at how reforms affect within-country differences in the response of output and employment between sectors with high and low natural layoff rates.24 The empirical approach follows the methodology proposed by Bassanini, Nunziata, and Venn (2009), who assess the long-term effect of regulations governing dismissal on sectoral total factor productivity growth. The results of this analysis suggest that the effects of employment protection legislation reforms vary positively with the degree of natural layoff, increasing employment more in sectors in which regulations are more binding.25 The magnitude of the estimated coefficient suggests that the differential effect of employment legislation reforms for a sector that has relatively high constraints on layoffs (at the 75th percentile of the distribution of layoff rates) compared with a sector that has relatively low con\u0002straints on layoffs (at the 25th percentile) is about 1¾ percent. In addition, for a given natural layoff rate, the effect is positive under strong economic conditions and negative during periods of slack, confirming the results of the macro analysis (Figure 3.10, panels 7 and 8). Unemployment Benefits Reforms that reduce the income replacement rates of unemployment benefits are found to have sta\u0002tistically significant and long-lasting effects on the unemployment rate (Figure 3.11, panel 1). In particu\u0002lar, reforms—which in the sample are associated with reductions in the OECD indicator of average gross income replacement rate that range between 2 and 12 percentage points—reduce the rate of unemployment by about ½ percentage point in the short term (one year after the reform) and by about 1½ percentage points on average in the medium term (four years after). This result is consistent with the evidence provided by Bouis and others (2012), who find that 24The main advantage of this approach, compared with the macroeconomic analysis, is that it can control for country-year fixed effects and therefore for all the macroeconomic variables as well as unobserved factors that can affect economic activity and be correlated with employment protection legislation reforms. Data for sectoral layoff rates have been kindly provided by Andrea Bassanini.

MACROECONOMIC EFFEC TS OF L ABOR AND PRODUC T MARKET REFORMS International Monetary Fund | April 2016 large reductions in the initial income replacement rate increase employment rates by, on average, about 1 percentage point over the medium term. The results also suggest that undertaking unem\u0002ployment benefit reductions jointly with major reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of active labor market policies, including through enhanced public employment services—for example, integration between job placement and benefit payment services to create so-called one-stop shops for the unemployed— amplifies their effects. Similarly, although major reduc\u0002tions in the duration of unemployment benefits do not have, on average, statistically significant effects on unemployment, they are associated with a statistically significant medium-term reduction in unemployment (more than 2 percentage points) when implemented together with reforms that enhance the design of active labor market policies.26 However, unemployment benefit reforms have weaker—indeed, statistically nonsignificant—effects during periods of slack (Figure 3.11, panels 2 and 3). This asymmetric impact may reflect the larger adverse fiscal multiplier effect from benefit cuts, as well as their bigger impact on workers’ incentives to reduce consumption in favor of precautionary saving, in bad times compared with good times (Whang 2015).27 Furthermore, insofar as the number of jobs is limited in recessions, enhancing search incentives by cutting benefits is likely to be less effective (Landais, Michaillat, and Saez 2015). Labor Tax Wedges The analysis shows that shocks to labor tax wedges have statistically significant short- and medium-term effects on output and employment (Figure 3.12, panels 1 and 2).28 A reduction of 1 percent in labor 26Reforms that enhance the design of active labor market policies are not found here to have statistically significant effects on unem\u0002ployment when implemented alone. 27Using a heterogeneous-agents model that combines matching frictions in the labor market with incomplete asset markets and nominal rigidities, Ravn and Sterk (2013) show that a reduction in consumption in favor of precautionary saving (brought about by an increase in job uncertainty) decreases aggregate demand and firms’ hiring, thereby further weakening demand. They find that the effect is quantitatively important, being potentially large enough to explain the increase in U.S. unemployment during the Great Recession. 28The analysis uses a measure, derived from OECD tax models, that defines a tax wedge as the difference between the labor cost to the employer and the corresponding net take-home pay of the employee for a single-earner couple with two children earning 100 percent of the average productive wage. The measure expresses the sum of personal income tax and all social security contributions as a percentage of total labor cost. tax wedges increases the level of output (employment) by about 0.15 (0.2) percent in the year of the shock and by about 0.6 (0.7) percent after four years. These effects eventually level off. Estimates are consistent with others reported in the literature (for instance, Bas\u0002sanini and Duval 2006 and references cited therein).

This finding suggests that making tax structures more employment friendly by shifting the tax burden away from labor has positive effects on output and employ\u0002ment (Bouis and others 2012). Cutting labor tax wedges is found to be more effective in periods of slack (Figure 3.12, panels 3 and 4). In such periods, a 1 percent reduction in labor tax wedges increases output by 0.5 percent in the year of the reform and by 0.8 percent after four years, whereas in expansions, the impact is not statistically distin\u0002guishable from zero. This finding is consistent with a growing literature that explores the effect of fiscal policy during recessions and expansions and points to larger fiscal multiplier effects during recessions (see Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012; Blanchard and Leigh 2013; Jordà and Taylor 2013; and Abiad, Furceri, and Topalova 2015). Spending on Active Labor Market Policies Discretionary increases in public spending on active labor market policies are found to have statistically significant medium-term output and employment effects (Figure 3.13, panels 1 and 2). A 10 percent increase in spending raises output and employment levels by about 0.35 percent four years after the shock, and the levels stabilize afterward. In addition, the effect on output materializes quickly, reaching 0.2 percent one year after the shock.29 Given that average spending on active labor market policies across the sample is 29To isolate changes in discretionary spending from fluctuations in spending driven by the business cycle, the analysis follows the approach inspired by Perotti (1999) and Corsetti, Meier, and Müller (2012), wherein spending shocks are identified as innovations to past spending and economic activity as well as to expectations about current economic activity. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 –1 0 1 2 3 4 –1.0 –0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 –1 0 1 2 3 4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 –1 0 1 2 3 4 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 –1 0 1 2 3 4 1.

MACROECONOMIC EFFEC TS OF L ABOR AND PRODUC T MARKET REFORMS International Monetary Fund | April 2016 about 1 percent of GDP, this implies a one-year-ahead multiplier of about 1.2, consistent with other estimates reported in the literature (see Coenen and others 2012 and literature cited therein). Shocks to spending on active labor market policies are found to have bigger effects in bad times. During periods of slack, a 10 percent increase in spending increases output by about 0.2 percent in the year of the shock and by about 0.6 percent after four years, whereas these effects are not statistically significantly different from zero in expansions (Figure 3.13, panels 3 and 4). As is also true in the case of shocks to labor tax wedges, this finding is consistent with the presence of larger fiscal multipliers in recessions. Spending on active labor market policies remains effective—even though the effects are smaller—if implemented in a budget-neutral way, and the effects are amplified when higher spending is combined with major reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of active labor market policies.30 The Role of Macroeconomic Policy As discussed earlier, the effects of some labor mar\u0002ket reforms—in particular, reforms of employment protection legislation and unemployment benefit systems—can become contractionary if the reforms are undertaken under weak economic conditions. A key question, then, is whether accompanying macro\u0002economic policy stimulus can offset these short-term costs and maximize the benefits from reforms, either directly, through its direct effect on aggregate demand, or indirectly, because higher aggregate demand may make firms more willing to hire and less willing to dismiss workers in the aftermath of the reforms—as suggested by the model-based analysis of employment protection legislation reforms discussed earlier. Explor\u0002ing this issue requires considering policy actions—both expansionary and contractionary—that are uncor\u0002related with reforms and can plausibly be deemed exogenous to macroeconomic conditions. For this purpose, the analysis focuses on fiscal policy shocks, which are identified as the forecast error of government consumption expenditure relative to GDP (for a simi\u0002lar approach, see Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012, 2013; and Abiad, Furceri, and Topalova 2015).31 30The effect of budget-neutral spending on active labor market policies does not vary substantially with the business cycle. 31This procedure also overcomes the problem of fiscal foresight (Forni and Gambetti 2010; Leeper, Richter, and Walker 2012; Leeper, Walker, and Yang 2013; Ben Zeev and Pappa 2014), because it aligns the economic agents’ and the econometrician’s The analysis indeed confirms that expansionary fiscal policy, in addition to stimulating aggregate demand, maximizes the benefits from labor market reforms (Figure 3.14).32 During periods of rela\u0002tively large fiscal expansion, reforms to employment protection legislation (unemployment benefits) are found to reduce the unemployment rate by about 2½ (3) percentage points in the medium term.33 In contrast, during periods of relatively large fiscal contraction, they have zero or adverse effects on unemployment.34 Reforms That Increase Participation of Women and Older Workers This subsection examines the effects of policies that can raise the labor force participation rates of women and older workers. Other labor market reforms have the potential to boost the participation rates of additional underrepresented population groups, such as youth and low-skilled migrants. Those reforms include well-de\u0002signed training programs, as well as reductions in tax wedges and youth-specific minimum wages (April 2016 Fiscal Monitor, Chapter 2; OECD 2015). The analysis shows that reducing the (marginal) income taxation of second earners has statistically significant effects on women’s labor force participation rates (Figure 3.15, panel 1).35 There is also evidence that increasing incen\u0002tives for part-time work and public spending on child care tends to increase women’s labor force participation rates (see also Christiansen and others, forthcoming). For older workers, reducing early retirement incen\u0002information sets. The correlation between the measure of fiscal shocks and reforms of employment protection legislation or unem\u0002ployment benefit systems is found to be close to zero. Likewise, the correlation between fiscal shocks and economic regime (or change in economic regime) is only –0.11 (0.01) and is not statistically significant. 32Consistent with this finding, Bordon, Ebeke, and Shirono (2016) find that supportive macroeconomic policies enhance the effect of product market reforms on employment. 33See Annex 3.3 for details on the empirical specification used, as well as for the definition of expansionary and contractionary fiscal regimes. 34Qualitatively similar results are found for employment and out\u0002put. A potential concern regarding the analysis is that fiscal shocks may respond to output growth surprises. Analysis of the data shows that these shocks are weakly correlated with growth surprises. More\u0002over, purifying fiscal shocks by removing the portion explained by growth surprises delivers results that are similar to, and not different with statistical significance from, those reported in Figure 3.12. 35Given the limited time sample over which a measure of tax wedges on second earners is available (2000–12), the analysis exam\u0002ines the effect on participation rates up to three years after the shock. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 120 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO SLOW FOR TOO LONG International Monetary Fund | April 2016 tives by lowering the implicit tax on continued work embedded in old-age pension systems—for example, by increasing bonuses for deferred retirement or minimum statutory retirement ages—is found to boost these work\u0002ers’ labor market participation (Figure 3.15, panel 2), as well as employment rates overall. The magnitude of the effect is consistent with other estimates reported in the literature (see, for example, Duval 2003). Summary and Policy Implications Is now a good time to make a big push for addi\u0002tional structural reform in advanced economies? The three basic findings of this chapter support a qualified “yes,” for several reasons: • There is a strong need and scope for substantial fur\u0002ther reforms of product market regulations—espe\u0002cially those governing retail trade and professional services—and labor market institutions. • The political environment is currently conducive to such reforms, at least for product markets, given the worries about weak growth (see Box 3.1). • Product and labor market reforms can raise potential output and employment levels over the medium term (Table 3.1). These findings justify further reform efforts in many advanced economies, particularly in those with the greatest scope for reform—such as, to various extents, some euro area countries, Japan, and Korea. But the “yes” must be qualified by three other considerations: 1. Female Participation Rate 2. Older Worker Participation Rate Source: IMF staff estimates. Note: t = 0 is the year of the shock.

MACROECONOMIC EFFEC TS OF L ABOR AND PRODUC T MARKET REFORMS International Monetary Fund | April 2016 • Most reforms are likely to make only a small near-term contribution to the ongoing economic recovery, as it takes time for the gains to materialize, particularly in countries where economic conditions are weak. • Wherever possible, labor market reforms need to be accompanied by supportive macroeconomic poli\u0002cies—including fiscal stimulus where space is avail\u0002able and a strong medium-term fiscal framework is in place—to enhance their short-term benefits at the current juncture. • Structural reforms can raise the long-term level of output, as the chapter shows, but their growth effects appear to be transitory. The qualifications highlight the need for careful prioritization and sequencing of reforms as well as for complementary macroeconomic policies, especially for labor market reforms. Product market reforms should be implemented forcefully, as they boost output even under weak macroeconomic conditions and would not worsen public finances. In contrast, narrowing unemployment benefits and easing job protections should be accompanied by other policies to offset their short-term cost; alternatively, they might even be grandfathered or be enacted with their implementation deferred until a (suitably defined) better time arrives. Finally, because product and labor market reforms are no silver bullet, policymakers should undertake them in combination with other growth-oriented reforms. Annex 3.1. Modeling the Effects of Product and Labor Market Reforms This annex presents the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model used to assess the effects of reforms. The model considers a currency union that consists of two countries and two sectors (tradables and nontrad\u0002ables) in each country—although key insights are qualita\u0002tively robust to considering a small open economy under a flexible exchange rate regime instead.36 Full details are provided by Cacciatore and others (forthcoming-b), who in turn build on earlier work by Cacciatore and Fiori (2016) and Cacciatore, Fiori, and Ghironi (forthcoming) that develops a novel theoretical framework for studying the consequences of product and labor market reforms and their interactions with macroeconomic policy. The main features of the model are the following: • Households—These consist of a continuum of members and maximize the present value of their utility, which 36See related work by Cacciatore and others (2015). depends on consumption of a basket of nontradable and (domestic and foreign) tradable goods. Because of labor and product market imperfections described later, a fraction of the household members will be unemployed and receive unemployment benefits from the government, financed through lump-sum taxes. The representative household owns the capital stock and also invests in a noncontingent bond, as well as in a mutual fund of nontradables sector firms through which new entrants can finance their entry costs. • Firms—In each country, there are two vertically integrated production stages. Upstream, perfectly competitive firms use capital and labor to produce a nontradable intermediate input. Downstream, monop\u0002olistically competitive firms purchase intermediate inputs and produce differentiated nontradable goods. These goods are consumed, but also used by competi\u0002tive firms in the tradables sector to produce a tradable good that is sold to consumers in both countries. • Job destruction—While the rental market for capital is fully competitive, the labor market is imperfect and characterized by job-search-and-matching frictions with endogenous job creation and destruction as in Mortensen and Pissarides 1994 and den Haan, Ramey, and Watson 2000. Jobs are located in the intermediate goods sector. They can be destroyed for exogenous and endogenous motives. One endogenous motive is that jobs are subject to both common and job-specific productivity shocks in each period. If productivity is less than an endogenously determined threshold below which the value of keeping a partic\u0002ular job is less than the cost of discontinuing it, the firm dismisses the worker and pays the firing costs. The higher the firing costs, the lower the productivity threshold below which jobs are destroyed. Firing costs take the form of administrative costs of layoff proce\u0002dures, and hence, are not transferred to workers and therefore should not be misconstrued as severance payments. Laid-off workers become unemployed and immediately begin searching for a new job. • Job creation—Job creation is subject to matching fric\u0002tions. To hire a worker, firms post job vacancies, incur\u0002ring a cost. The probability of finding a worker depends on the degree of tightness of the labor market and the efficiency of the matching process. In turn, matching efficiency may be thought of as being partly affected by active labor market policies, although these are not specifically modeled. The representative intermediate goods producer chooses the number of vacancies, the job destruction threshold, and its capital stock so as ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 122 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO SLOW FOR TOO LONG International Monetary Fund | April 2016 to maximize the present value of profits. Profits, and therefore job creation, also depend on wages, which are set through a negotiation process between firms and workers—so-called Nash bargaining. Stronger bargain\u0002ing power of workers in this process, more generous unemployment benefits, or both raise wage claims and thereby reduce profits and job creation incentives, all else being equal. At the same time, higher wages raise consumption, aggregate demand, and—through this effect—job creation incentives, also all else being equal. The hiring-firing process creates dynamics (turnover) in the labor market, and employment varies depending on endogenous variations in job creation and destruction. • Product market dynamics and regulation—The number of firms serving the nontradable goods market is endogenous.37 Prior to entry, firms pay a sunk entry cost that reflects both a technological component (for example, sunk technological costs required to start producing electricity) and administrative costs of regu\u0002lation. New entrants start producing after one period, increasing competition among firms and reducing profit margins and prices for all. Entry occurs until a new entrant’s discounted value of future profits equals the sunk entry costs. Firm exit is exogenous and occurs when a firm is hit by a “death shock.” This entry-exit process creates firm dynamics in the goods market. Finally, producers face (quadratic) price adjustment costs, resulting in sticky prices. • Monetary policy—Since model parameters are chosen to match features of euro area macroeconomic data, monetary policy is assumed to respond to inflation and the output gap as estimated historically in the euro area. The policy rate cannot fall below a certain threshold—in practice, here, the zero lower bound—but the argument is more general. Implementation of Reforms under Alternative Macroeconomic Conditions The analysis simulates permanent unanticipated reforms across the whole currency union. It considers four possible reforms to product market regulation, employment protection legislation, unemployment benefit systems, and active labor market policies. More precisely, the analysis focuses on (1) a reduction in entry barriers to the level estimated for the United 37The model focuses on entry in the nontradables sector to cap\u0002ture the focus of current policy discussions on this sector. Cacciatore, Fiori, and Ghironi (forthcoming) focus on entry in the tradables sector. States (for details, see Cacciatore and others, forthcom\u0002ing-b); (2) the elimination of administrative costs of layoff procedures;38 (3) a reduction to U.S. levels in workers’ average unemployment benefit replacement rate over a five-year unemployment spell; and (4) a 50 percent increase in the efficiency of the job-matching process, which, according to estimates by Murtin and Robin (2014), would bring average matching efficiency across the euro area roughly to the (higher) average level across Sweden and the United Kingdom. Reforms are carried out under three alternative macro\u0002economic conditions: (1) in “normal times,” correspond\u0002ing to the economy’s initial steady state; (2) in “bad times with constrained monetary policy,” which means in the immediate aftermath of a recession driven by a risk-pre\u0002mium shock that increased the required return on finan\u0002cial assets, depressing output and generating deflation (see, for instance, Eggertsson and Woodford 2003);39 and (3) in “bad times with unconstrained monetary policy,” which is situation (2) but now assuming as a thought experiment that the policy rate can freely fall below zero. Annex 3.2. Identification of Reforms and Policy Shocks Product Market, Employment Protection Legislation, and Unemployment Benefit Reforms Identification Approach Major reforms of product market regulation, employ\u0002ment protection legislation, and unemployment ben\u0002efit systems are identified by examining documented legislative and regulatory actions reported in all available Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel\u0002opment (OECD) Economic Surveys for 26 individual advanced economies since 1970, as well as additional country-specific sources (see Annex 3.4 for the list of countries covered). In this respect, the methodology is closely related to the “narrative approach” used by Romer and Romer (1989, 2004, 2010, and 2015) and Devries and others (2011) to identify monetary and fiscal shocks and periods of high financial distress. The approach also considers both reforms and “counterreforms”—namely, policy changes in the opposite direction. 38Relaxing employment protection legislation may also lower workers’ bargaining power (Blanchard and Giavazzi 2003). This effect is not considered here. 39The size of the risk premium shock is chosen so as to deliver a 4 percent peak-to-trough decline in output, while its persistence is such that, in the absence of reform, the zero lower bound binds for approximately two years. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 123 CHAPTER 3 TIME FOR A SUPPLY-SIDE BOOST? MACROECONOMIC EFFEC TS OF L ABOR AND PRODUC T MARKET REFORMS International Monetary Fund | April 2016 In a first step, more than 1,000 legislative and regula\u0002tory actions are identified in the areas of product market regulation, employment protection legislation, unem\u0002ployment benefits, and the design of active labor market policies over the entire sample. In a second step, for any of these actions to qualify as a major reform, one of the following three alternative criteria must be met: (1) the OECD survey uses strong normative language to define the action, suggestive of an important measure (for example, “major reform”); (2) the policy action is men\u0002tioned repeatedly across different issues of the OECD survey or in the retrospective summaries of key past reforms that are featured in some issues, for the country considered; or (3) the OECD indicator of the regulatory stance in the area considered—if available—displays a very large change (in the 5th percentile of the distribu\u0002tion of the change in the indicator). When only the last of these conditions is met, an extensive search through other sources is performed to identify the precise policy action underpinning the change in the indicator. Annex Table 3.2.1 provides an example of how these criteria have guided the identification of major reforms and counterreforms in the area of product market regulation, employment protection legislation, and unemployment benefits (for details, see Duval and others, forthcoming). One important advantage of this approach is that it identifies the precise nature and timing of major legislative and regulatory actions taken by advanced economies since the early 1970s in key labor and product market policy areas. Specifically, compared with existing databases on policy actions in the area of labor market institutions (such as the European Commission Labref, Fondazione Rodolfo de Benedetti–IZA, and International Labour Organization EPLex databases), the approach allows identification of major legislative and regulatory reforms as opposed to just actions. This is particularly useful for empirical analysis that seeks to identify, and then estimate, the effects or the drivers of reform shocks. The approach also improves along several dimensions on indirect methods that rely exclusively on changes in OECD policy indicators to identify policy shocks. Specifically, the approach is able to do the following: • Identify the exact timing of major legislative and regulatory actions • Identify the precise reforms that underpin a gradual decline in OECD policy indicators without any obvious break (for example, for some countries in some network industries—air, rail, and road trans\u0002portation; electricity and gas distribution; telecom\u0002munications and postal services) • Cover reform areas for which no time-varying policy indicators exist, such as conditionality in the provision of unemployment benefits or major reforms regarding the design of activation policies, such as the integration of job placement and benefit payment services • Identify reforms in areas for which OECD indi\u0002cators exist but do not cover all relevant policy dimensions (for example, a major reform that lowers the duration of unemployment benefits from an indefinite period to five years is not captured by the corresponding OECD indicator, which covers the first five years of an unemployment spell) • Cover a longer time period in some policy areas, such as employment protection legislation, for which OECD indicators are available only starting from the mid-1980s • Document and describe the precise legislative and regulatory actions that underpin observed large changes in the OECD indicator • Differentiate between announcement and imple\u0002mentation dates of reforms, in some cases40 In contrast, the approach does not allow any infor\u0002mation to be provided regarding the stance of current or past product and labor market regulations and as such is clearly no substitute for existing policy indica\u0002tors, for instance, those produced by the OECD. Number of Identified Reforms Annex Figure 3.2.1 shows the number of reforms identified in the sample and illustrates the heterogeneity of reform efforts across regulatory areas. Product market reforms have been most frequently implemented, in particular as regards the regulation of network indus\u0002tries (Annex Figure 3.2.1, panel 1).41 In general, fewer reforms have been implemented in the areas of employ\u0002ment protection legislation and unemployment benefit systems. One exception has been the rather widespread relaxation of employment protection legislation for temporary contracts. In part, this may reflect political 40While the limited number of cases for which the announce\u0002ment and the implementation date of reforms is available prevents systematic use of this information in the cross-country analysis, this information could be useful in microstudies aimed at assessing the impact of reforms, including through anticipation effects. 41Economy-wide product market reform episodes are then defined as events during which reform occurs in at least two out of the seven net\u0002work industries, which corresponds to the 90th percentile of the distri\u0002bution of the sum of all seven reform dummy variables. Similar results are obtained when the distribution of the weighted sum of the reform dummies is used instead, with weights equal to the (country-sector-spe\u0002cific time-varying) share of value added of each sector in GDP. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 124 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TOO SLOW FOR TOO LONG International Monetary Fund | April 2016 economy obstacles that in some cases have made it diffi\u0002cult to reform poorly functioning institutions (Box 3.1), but also that societal preferences (for insurance against economic risk) vary across countries and that different labor market institutional models can be successful. Labor Tax Wedge Shocks Labor tax wedge shocks are identified as the annual change in the main tax wedge measure derived from OECD tax models. This measure is defined as the wedge between the labor cost to the employer and the corresponding net take-home pay of the employee for an average single-earner couple with two children, and it expresses the sum of personal income tax and all social security contributions as a percentage of total labor cost. Discretionary Shocks to Public Spending on Active Labor Market Policies The methodology used to identify shocks to dis\u0002cretionary spending on active labor market policies follows the approach inspired by Perotti (1999) and Corsetti, Meier, and Müller (2012). In this approach, spending shocks are identified as innovations to past spending and economic activity as well as to expec\u0002tations about current economic activity.42 Data for 42Specifically, spending shocks are identified as the residuals of the following regression: ∆s it = ai + γt + βi ∆yit–1 + δi∆y E it–1 + ϑi ∆s it–1 + εit, in which Δs denotes the growth rate of public spending on active labor market policies; Δy is GDP growth; ΔyE denotes the forecast for GDP growth at time t, made at t – 1; and ai and γt are country and time fixed effects, respectively.

The Wedge between the Tax Rates of Second Earners and Single Individuals The wedge between the tax rates of second earners and single individuals is computed as the ratio of Tax second earner to Tax single individual. The Tax second earner variable is calculated as Tax second earner = 1 – (Household Net Income)B – (Household Net Income)A (Household Gross Income)B – (Household Gross Income)A, in which A represents the case in which the second earner does not earn any income and B the case in which the second earner’s gross earnings are 67 percent of average earnings. The Tax single individual variable is computed using the same formula for a single person. Data on tax rates of second earners and single individ\u0002uals are taken from the OECD Family Database. Implicit Tax on Continued Work Data for implicit tax on continued work embedded in old-age pension systems are taken from and updated using the methodology described by Duval (2003). This variable measures the change in pension wealth— calculated as the change in present value of the stream of future pension payments net of contributions to the system—from working five more years, for “typical” workers at ages 55, 60, and 65. It varies depending, for instance, on the minimum age of eligibility for benefits or the existence and magnitude of pension adjustments for early or deferred retirement. Annex 3.3. The Macroeconomic Effects of Reforms: Empirical Analysis Cross-Country Analysis Empirical Strategy The analysis in this section assesses the macroeco\u0002nomic impact of reforms. Two econometric specifica\u0002tions are used. The first establishes whether reforms have statistically significant effects on macroeconomic variables such as output, (un)employment, and infla\u0002tion. The second assesses whether these effects vary with overall business conditions prevailing at the time of a particular reform (weak versus strong economic conditions) or with the stance of accompanying macro\u0002economic policies (fiscal expansions versus fiscal con\u0002tractions). The statistical method follows the approach proposed by Jordà (2005) to estimate impulse-response functions. This approach has been advocated by Stock and Watson (2007) and Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012), among others, as a flexible alternative to vector autoregression (autoregressive distributed-lag) specifi\u0002cations since it does not impose dynamic restrictions. It is also particularly suited to estimating nonlineari\u0002ties (including interactions between shocks and other variables of interest) in the dynamic response. The first regression specification is estimated as follows: yt + k,i – yt –1,i = ai + γt + βkRi,t + θXi,t + εi,t , (A3.3.1) in which y is the log of output (log of employment, unemployment rate, log of productivity, log of price level); ai are country fixed effects, included to take account of differences in countries’ average growth rates; γt are time fixed effects, included to take account of global shocks such as shifts in oil prices or the Annex Figure 3.2.1.

In the second specification, the response is allowed to vary with the state of the economy and the stance of fiscal policy: yi,t + k – yi,t –1 = ai + γt + βk LF (zi,t) Ri,t+ βH k (1 – F (zi,t)) Ri,t+θZi,t +εi,t , (A3.3.2) with F (zit) = exp (–δzit) , δ > 0, 1 + exp (–δzit) in which z is an indicator of the state of the economy (or the stance of fiscal policy) normalized to have zero mean and unit variance and Z is a set of control vari\u0002ables, including past economic growth, past reforms, recession dummies, and the state of the economy or the stance of fiscal policy.43 The indicator of the state of the economy considered in the analysis is GDP growth.44 The indicator of the stance of fiscal policy is a government consumption shock, identified as the forecast error of government consumption expenditure relative to GDP (for a similar approach see, for exam\u0002ple, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012, 2013; and Abiad, Furceri, and Topalova 2015).45 Equations (A3.3.1) and (A3.3.2) are estimated for each k = 0, . . . , 4. Impulse-response functions are computed using the estimated coefficients βk , and the confidence bands associated with the estimated impulse-response functions are obtained using the 43This approach is equivalent to the smooth-transition autoregressive model developed by Granger and Teräsvirta (1993). The advantage of this approach is twofold. First, compared with a model in which each reform variable is interacted with the unemployment rate or business cycle measures, this approach tests directly whether the effect of reforms varies across different regimes such as recessions (for example, output growth below a given threshold) and expansions. Second, compared with estimating structural vector autoregressions for each regime, it allows the effect of reforms to change smoothly between recessions and expansions by considering a continuum of states to compute the impulse-response functions, thus making the response more stable and precise. 44Following Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012), δ = 1.5 is used here for the analysis of recessions and expansions. Periods of very low (high) growth identified in this analysis also correspond to periods of large negative (positive) output gaps. Similar results are indeed found when the output gap rather than GDP growth is used. 45This procedure also overcomes the problem of fiscal foresight (Forni and Gambetti 2010; Leeper, Richter, and Walker 2012; Leeper, Walker, and Yang 2013; Ben Zeev and Pappa 2014), because it aligns the economic agents’ and the econometrician’s information sets. Here, δ = 1 is used to assess the role of the fiscal policy stance. The results do not qualitatively change for different values of δ > 0. estimated standard errors of the coefficients βk , based on clustered robust standard errors. The macroeconomic series used in the analysis come from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Economic Outlook: Statistics and Projections database, which covers an unbalanced sample of 26 OECD economies over the period 1970–2014 (see Annex 3.4 for details). The forecasts of government consumption used in the analysis are those reported in the fall issue of the OECD’s Economic Outlook for the same year. As a robustness check, the forecasts of the spring issue of the same year and the fall issue of the previous year are used. Robustness Checks A possible concern regarding the analysis is that the probability of structural reform is influenced not only by past economic growth and the occurrence of reces\u0002sions (Box 3.1), but also by contemporaneous economic developments as well as expectations of future growth. However, this is unlikely to be a major issue, given the long lags associated with the implementation of struc\u0002tural reforms and that information about future growth is likely to be largely embedded in past economic activity. Most important, controlling for expectations of current and future growth delivers results that are very similar to, and not statistically significantly different from, those reported in the chapter text (Annex Figure 3.3.1). Another possible concern regarding the analysis is that the results may suffer from omitted-variables bias, as reforms may occur across different areas at the same time. However, including all reforms across all areas simultaneously in the estimated equation does not substantially alter the magnitude and the statistical significance of the results (Annex Figure 3.3.1). Finally, estimates could be biased in the event of reform reversals. In practice, however, this bias is neg\u0002ligible, as there are only a very few such cases. Further\u0002more, the results are robust to controlling for future reforms and counterreforms, as well as to focusing exclusively on reform episodes. Sector- and Firm-Level Analysis To provide additional insights into the transmission channels of product and labor market reforms and to address some of the limitations of the macroecono\u0002metric analysis (by fully controlling for countrywide economic shocks that coincide with reforms), the macroeconomic analysis is complemented by sector- or firm-level approaches or both. ©International Monetary Fund.

MACROECONOMIC EFFEC TS OF L ABOR AND PRODUC T MARKET REFORMS International Monetary Fund | April 2016 Product Market Reforms: Direct Effects The direct effects of product market reforms on sectoral (or firm) output are estimated using a specification similar to (A3.3.1) but augmented by country-year (aij ) and country-sector (γij ) fixed effects as well as by sector time trends (trendj ): yj,i,t+k – yj,i,t–1 = ait + γij + trendj + βkRj,i,t + εj,i,t , (A3.3.3) in which i denotes country, j sector (or firm), and t year. The inclusion of these two types of fixed effects provides two important advantages compared with the cross-country analysis: (1) country-year fixed effects make it possible to control for any variation that is common to all sectors of a country’s economy, including aggregate output growth as well as reforms in other areas; and (2) country-industry fixed effects allow industry-specific factors, including, for instance, cross-country differences in the growth of certain sectors that could arise from differ\u0002ences in comparative advantage, to be controlled for. The firm-level analysis in addition controls for past and future reforms, industry-year fixed effects, and key firm charac\u0002teristics such as age, size, debt, and labor productivity. The sectoral series used in the analysis of direct effects of product market reforms come from the OECD Struc\u0002tural Analysis (STAN) database, which provides annual information on sectoral input, output, and prices over the period 1970–2011.46 The firm-level series are taken from the Orbis database, which covers an unbalanced sample of 20 advanced economies over the period 1998–2013.47 Product Market Reforms: Indirect Effects The indirect effects of product market reforms on sec\u0002toral output through their spillovers to other sectors are estimated using a specification similar to (A3.3.3) but focusing instead on a term for the interaction between product market reforms in each network industry and the total input requirement of downstream (upstream) industries from upstream (downstream) industries: yj,i,t+k – yj,i,t–1 = aij + γit + trendj + βkΣ s≠jwI/O js,i,t Rs,i,t + εj,i,t , (A3.3.4) in which wI js,i,t is the share of intermediate inputs provided by each network industry s in country i 46See Bouis, Duval, and Eugster, forthcoming, for further details on the construction of the data set and the analysis. 47See Gal and Hijzen, forthcoming, for further details on the construction of the data set and the analysis. to downstream industry j, and wO js,i,t is the share of intermediate inputs provided by each industry j in country i to downstream network industry s.

Employment Protection Legislation Reforms The empirical approach used to assess the effect of employment protection legislation reforms on sectoral employment builds on the methodology proposed by Bassanini, Nunziata, and Venn (2009). The analysis relies on the identification assumption that stringent dismissal regulations are likely to be more binding in sectors that are characterized by a higher natural propensity to regularly adjust their workforce (Lj ): yj,i,t+k – yj,i,t–1 = ait + γij + trendj + βkLjRi,t + εj,i,t . (A3.3.5) The sectoral series used in this analysis come from the EU KLEMS and World KLEMS databases (Timmer and others 2015). Data on layoff rates are taken from Bas\u0002sanini, Nunziata, and Venn 2009 and are computed based on industry-level U.S. layoff rates reported in the 2004 Current Population Survey Displaced Workers Supplement. While relying on U.S. layoff rates can be considered a good proxy for underlying layoff propensity in the absence of dismissal regulations, one potential problem with this approach is that they may not be representative for the whole sample—that is, U.S. layoff rates may be affected by U.S.-specific regulations or sectoral patterns. To check for the sensitivity of the results to this assumption, the analysis is replicated using U.K. layoff rates computed from the U.K. Labour Force Survey. The results based on U.K. layoff rates are very similar to, and not statistically significantly different from, those based on U.S. layoff rates. Annex 3.4.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "“I have said in the past that left-wing extremism is the single biggest security challenge to the Indian state. It continues to be so.” – Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.[i] From Ideology To Warfare The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. Resurgence Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. A New Strategy “We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.” -Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. Overruns On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • Used improvised explosive devices. Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • Assassinated officials. In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • Destroyed police infrastructure. Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj Systems Disruption At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? The Deviant Economic Engine “The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.” -Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. The Revolutionary Tax In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. A Revolutionary Tax Economy To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • Mining. Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • Narcotics. India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • Informal tolls. Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. A Strategic Half-Life “It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they look to the Naxals for justice.” –Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future.

The article brings into picture the rise of India’s gaming sector and challenges associated with it. **For Prelims:** **[Natural disasters](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/states-demand-to-declare-lightning-as-a-natural-disaster), [Cyclones](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper1/cyclone-19)**, 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, [**Cyclone Remal**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-remal), [**National Disaster Management Authority**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/national-disaster-management-authority-1), [**Extreme weather events**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/himalayas-more-prone-to-extreme-weather-events), [**Heat waves**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/heat-waves-and-heat-index#:~:text=Heat%20wave%20is%20considered%20if,C%20to%206.4%C2%B0C.), Disaster Management Act of 2005, [**Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction**](https://www.drishtiias.com/summary-of-important-reports/sendai-framework-report), Hyogo Framework for Action, **[Cyclone Biparjoy](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/india-s-cyclone-preparedness), [2022 Joshimath land subsidence crisis.](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/joshimath-land-subsidence)** **For Mains:** Framework Related to Disaster Management in India, Factors are Exacerbating India’s Disaster Risk. India is a vast country prone to a multitude of [**natural disasters**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/states-demand-to-declare-lightning-as-a-natural-disaster). From the wrath of [**cyclones**](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper1/cyclone-19) like **Odisha in 1999** to [**2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami**](https://www.drishtiias.com/printpdf/disaster-management-i#:~:text=The%20Indian%20Ocean%20Tsunami%20(2004,more%20than%202%20lakh%20people.) to the recent landslides triggered by [**Cyclone Remal**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-remal) in the Northeast, the country has witnessed the destructive force of nature. While the establishment of the [**National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/national-disaster-management-authority-1) marked a positive step. The very nature of disasters has undergone a drastic shift. [**Extreme weather events**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/himalayas-more-prone-to-extreme-weather-events), often intensified by climate change, are becoming more frequent and severe. New threats like [**heat waves**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/heat-waves-and-heat-index#:~:text=Heat%20wave%20is%20considered%20if,C%20to%206.4%C2%B0C.) are emerging, and even more concerning is the rise of **multi-hazard disasters**, leading to cascading effects and far greater destruction. In this critical scenario, reactive measures are no longer enough. India needs a **proactive approach** that prioritizes disaster preparedness. ### What is the Framework Related to Disaster Management in India? - **Disaster Management Act of 2005:** The [**Disaster Management Act of 2005**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/disaster-management-act-2005-invoked) has provided the legal and institutional framework for disaster management in India at national, state and district levels. - While the **primary responsibility of disaster management rests with the States**, the Central Government supports the efforts of State Governments by providing logistical and financial support. - **Institutional Framework under Disaster Management Act of 2005** : - **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA):** Apex body headed by the **Prime Minister,** responsible for policy, plan, and guideline formulation for disaster management (DM). - NDMA addresses both **natural and man-made disasters** and coordinates enforcement and implementation. - **National Executive Committee (NEC):** Assists NDMA, chaired by the Union **Home Secretary,** comprising various secretaries and officials. - Prepares and monitors the National Plan for DM and coordinates responses to disaster situations. - **State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA):** Headed by the **Chief Minister,** responsible for state-level DM policies and plans, coordinating implementation, and integrating mitigation measures in state development plans. - **District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA):** Led by the **District Collector** with an elected representative as Co-Chairperson. - Prepares and implements district-level DM plans and ensures compliance with national and state policies. - **Local Authorities:** Includes **[Panchayati Raj Institutions](https://www.drishtiias.com/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-national-institutions/panchayati-raj-institution-pri), [Municipalities](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/urban-local-government-in-india)**, **District and Cantonment Boards**, and Town Planning Authorities. Responsible for capacity building, relief, rehabilitation, and preparing DM plans. - **Key Institutions:** - **National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM)**: Focuses on capacity development, training, research, and documentation. - Functions under NDMA’s guidelines and aims to become a **‘Centre of Excellence’ in DM.** - **National Disaster Response Force (NDRF):** Specialized response force for natural and man-made disasters, including Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear emergencies. - Operates under NDMA's direction, with eight battalions positioned across different locations. - **Committees:** - **Cabinet Committee on Management of Natural Calamities (CCMNC):** Oversees management of natural calamities, suggests preventive measures, and promotes public awareness. - **International Commitments:** - [**Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR):**](https://www.drishtiias.com/summary-of-important-reports/sendai-framework-report) India is a signatory to the SFDRR which was adopted during the **Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction** in March 2015. - India is dedicated to achieving the seven goals set under the framework through systematic and sustainable efforts. - **Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA):** India is a signatory to the HFA, adopted globally to reduce disaster losses in lives and economic and environmental assets. - The HFA set three strategic goals and five priority action areas focused on integrating disaster risk reduction into **sustainable development policies,** capacity building, preparedness, and vulnerability reduction. ### What are the Current Major Disaster Threats that India Faces? - **Floods**: India experiences frequent [**floods**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/floods-havoc-in-india#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20cause%20of,dams%2C%20barrages%2C%20or%20siltation.), particularly during the monsoon season. Over **40 million hectares (12% of land)** are prone to floods and river erosion. It is getting exacerbated by [**Glacial Lake Outburst Floods.**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/glacial-lake-outburst-flood#:~:text=A%20glacial%20lake%20outburst%20flood,or%20the%20inflow%20of%20meltwater.) - **Examples:** Floods in **Bihar (2023), Assam** (2022) - **Cyclones and Storms**: India's coastline is susceptible to cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Of the **7,516 km long coastline**, approximately **5,700 km** is vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis. - **Examples: [Cyclone Biparjoy](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/india-s-cyclone-preparedness) (2023)** and **[Cyclone Fani](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-fani) (2019).** - **Earthquakes:** India is located in a seismically active region, with several fault lines running across the country. 58.6% of the landmass is prone to moderate to very high intensity earthquakes. - **Examples:** Earthquake in **Mizoram** (2022), Earthquake in **Sikkim** (2011) - **Droughts:** Prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall patterns can lead to severe [**droughts,**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/drought-in-europe) affecting agriculture and water resources. **68%** of the cultivable area is susceptible to drought. - **Examples:** Drought in 66% of **Maharashtra** (2024). - **Landslides:** Hilly and mountainous regions in India are prone to [**landslides**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/landslide-atlas-of-india#:~:text=Landslides%20are%20natural%20disasters%20occurring,slope%20is%20termed%20a%20landslide.), especially during heavy rainfall or earthquakes. India is considered among the top five landslide-prone countries globally. - **Examples:** Landslides in **Himachal Pradesh (** 2023), Landslides in **Manipur** (2022). - **Heat Waves:** Rising temperatures and prolonged periods of high heat can lead to life-threatening heat waves. - **Examples:** Heat waves across India (2022, 2023, 2024). - The country reported **280 heat wave days** from 11th March- 18th May, 2022. - **Forest Fires:** Dry conditions and human activities can contribute to [**forest fires,**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/forest-fires-9#:~:text=Also%20called%20bush%20or%20vegetation,e.g.%2C%20wind%2C%20topography).) causing environmental damage and air pollution. Based on the forest inventory records, **54.40% of forests in India** are exposed to occasional fires - **Examples:** Forest fires in **Himachal Pradesh (2024)** and Forest fires in **Goa** (2023). - **Industrial and Chemical Accidents:** India's growing industrial sector and improper handling of hazardous materials can lead to industrial and chemical accidents. - **Examples:** Chemical spill in **Surat** (2023), Industrial fire in **Mumbai** (2024). ### What Factors are Exacerbating India’s Disaster Risk? - **Urbanization and Unplanned Development:** Rapid urbanization and unplanned development in cities have increased the vulnerability to disasters like floods and earthquakes. - **Example:** The **2023 Chennai floods** were attributed to unchecked development and encroachment on water bodies and wetlands. - **Rising Climate Change Impact:** Climate change is amplifying the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like cyclones, floods, and droughts. - **Example**: The devastating [**Cyclone Amphan in 2020**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-amphan) was fueled by warmer ocean temperatures due to climate change. - **Aging Infrastructure and Lack of Maintenance:** India's aging infrastructure, such as **dams, bridges, and buildings, coupled** with inadequate maintenance, increases the risk of disasters. - The **Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water** in 2023 raised concerns over the safety of aging dams that are **more than 100 years old.** - **Environmental Degradation:** Activities like **deforestation, mining, and unsustainable land-use practices** have increased the risk of landslides and soil erosion. - **Example:** The [**2022 Joshimath land subsidence crisis**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/joshimath-land-subsidence) in Uttarakhand was attributed to unregulated construction and mining activities. - **Industrial and Technological Hazards:** India's growing industrialization and reliance on hazardous materials increase the risk of industrial accidents and chemical disasters. - **Example:** The gas leak at a chemical plant in **Visakhapatnam** (2020) exposed thousands to toxic fumes. ### What Measures Should India Adopt to Reduce Disaster Risk and Enhance Disaster Preparedness? - **Establish Dedicated Disaster Response Corridors:** Designate and develop dedicated disaster response corridors, including **road networks, rail links, and air routes,** to ensure uninterrupted access for emergency services and aid during disasters. - These corridors could be designed to be resilient to hazards and equipped with necessary infrastructure and resources for efficient disaster response. - **Promote Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure:** Mandate the adoption of disaster-resilient design and construction principles for all critical infrastructure projects, such as bridges, dams, power plants, and communication networks. - Implementing **stricter building codes** that mandate disaster-resistant construction using **earthquake-proof materials, fire-proof materials and wind-resistant designs**. - Additionally, offering tax breaks and financial assistance for retrofitting existing structures to improve their resilience. - **Develop Disaster-Resilient Agricultural Practices:** Promote the adoption of disaster-resilient agricultural practices, such as drought-resistant crops, precision farming, and soil conservation techniques. - Learning from successful examples like **Burkina Faso's Zai pit farming technique,** which enhances soil moisture retention and crop yields during droughts. - **Promote Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR):** Integrate ecosystem-based approaches into disaster risk reduction strategies by conserving, restoring, and sustainably managing natural ecosystems like **forests, [wetlands](http://wetlands), and coastal habitats.** - These ecosystems can act as **natural barriers against hazards like floods, storms, and landslides,** while also providing co-benefits like carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. - **Strengthen Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems:** Develop robust, integrated early warning systems that can detect and provide timely alerts for multiple hazards, such as cyclones, floods, heatwaves, and landslides. - Leveraging advanced technologies like **[remote sensing](https://www.drishtiias.com/current-affairs-news-analysis-editorials/news-editorials/2023-05-12), AI, and [big data analytics](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper3/big-data-1)** to improve hazard monitoring, forecasting, and risk communication. - **Micronet Grids for Critical Infrastructure:** Establish localized, self-sufficient power grids powered by renewable sources like solar and micro-hydro for critical infrastructure like hospitals and communication systems. - This ensures continued functionality even during widespread power outages caused by disasters. - **Mental Health Response Teams:** Integrating mental health professionals into disaster response efforts to provide **psychological support** to survivors dealing with trauma, anxiety, and displacement. This can significantly improve long-term recovery outcomes. - **Enhanced Institutional Capacity:** The institutions must hire permanent workforce rather than contractual. - A permanent workforce allows for continuous **skill development, knowledge transfer, and institutional memory.** - This fosters a more capable disaster management system compared to relying on temporary staff who may lack experience. - Moreover, the Local bodies should be allocated a substantial **Disaster Readiness Reserve to complement disaster reactivity to proactive measures.** | | | --- | | **_Drishti Mains Question:_** Examine the factors contributing to India's increasing vulnerability to disasters.What measures should India adopt to enhance its disaster preparedness?? | ### UPSC Civil Services Examination Previous Year Question (PYQ) ### _Mains:_ **Q.** Discuss the recent measures initiated in disaster management by the Government of India departing from the earlier reactive approach. **(2020)** **Q.** Vulnerability is an essential element for defining disaster impacts and its threat to people.

Shah](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/kriti-m-shah) _The citizens’ right to protest is a pillar of Indian democracy. While citizens are allowed to peacefully assemble, however, protests and demonstrations sometimes take a violent turn; recent examples are the Jat protests in Haryana and the Kashmir unrest following the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, both in 2016. During such occasions, it is the prerogative of the Indian state to deal with the violent civil protests in a manner that ensures public order and protects citizens from harm. This paper discusses the use of force by security officials during periods of violent civil unrest and seeks to understand the ways and means of dealing with such protests in the country._ ## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

Today's spy doesn't wear a trench coat or sneak across borders — they slip into servers. A few lines of malicious code, a cleverly worded phishing email, and one careless click are enough to open a backdoor into power grids, defence networks, or corporate vaults. There's no gunfire, no alarm — just a silent invasion across cyberspace.Modern espionage no longer focuses on state secrets alone. It can paralyse ports, jam telecoms, empty bank accounts, and hold critical infrastructure hostage, all from thousands of miles away. Many of these attacks aren't random pranks but well-coordinated operations by advanced persistent threats (APTs) — hacker groups often backed by nation-states who monitor systems for months and even years — or by ‘Spider gangs', the global cybercrime cartels who chase profit, not politics.In Feb 2025, a hacker collective calling itself ‘Keymous+' targeted Gujarat's civic systems, according to FalconFeeds.io, a threat actor repository. The group overwhelmed the websites of Ahmedabad and Surat municipal corporations with fake web traffic in a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that crashed the portals for hours. Analysts found that Keymous+ boasted of 700 global attacks in 2025, 27.6% of which were govt entities while the rest ranged from finance and telecom to education. **You Can Also Check: [Ahmedabad AQI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-aqi-level-air-quality-index-today/3252) \\| [Weather in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-weather-forecast-today/380001) \\| [Gold Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/gold-rates-today/gold-price-in-ahemadabad) \\| [Silver Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/silver-rates-today/silver-price-in-ahemadabad)** But others aimed far deeper. In 2020, RedEcho, a group suspected to be backed by a nation-state, infiltrated India's power grid. They did not cause blackouts, but mapped out critical systems like the regional and state load despatch centres (RLDCs and SLDCs) — the nerve centres managing electricity supply — in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and several northern states. Cybersecurity experts at Recorded Future's Insikt group believe the hackers were creating digital \"backdoors\" — hidden entry points — \"to cause potential blackouts in the future\".Then came, TAG-38, another elite adversary sponsored by an enemy nation. Between Sep 2021 and March 2022, \"they targeted at least seven SLDCs in northern and western India, including areas near sensitive border zones\", states the Inskit group report. They cleverly hid their tracks by using hacked DVRs and IP cameras in Taiwan and South Korea to control their attacks remotely. These groups use advanced tools like ShadowPad (a modular malware that can be customised for different attacks) and remote access trojan (RAT) software that lets hackers control a computer from afar. They often get in through spear phishing — tricking someone into clicking a fake email link — or by exploiting weak spots in websites.India also faces threats from APT36 known as ‘Transparent Tribe', another group backed by an enemy nation and active since 2013. In March and April 2025, they disguised malware as updates on the ‘Pahalgam terror attack' to trick officials into opening infected files. They even created fake ministry of defence websites and used a sneaky trick called ClickFix, where malicious code is copied from a user's clipboard without them knowing.Meanwhile, SideCopy, another group, used fake social media profiles and phishing emails to target India's defence personnel. And APT41, also backed by an enemy nation, has been spying on India's healthcare and tech sectors, while also [hacking](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hacking) for money, even manipulating virtual currencies in online games.To combat such threats, Gujarat's science and technology department issued a circular this year, urging all govt employees to strengthen cyber hygiene. \"Do not share official photos or documents online, and never link work emails to personal apps,\" warned principal secretary Mona Kandhar. Officials were reminded that one careless click can compromise an entire department.The war is invisible, but it is already here. Every click, download, or forwarded file could be the entry point for a breach waiting to happen.

losses of **$12 billion (over Rs 1 lakh crore)** in India in calendar year 2023. ## **Key Highlights of the Report** - **Economic Losses in 2023**: - India suffered total **economic losses of $12 billion (over ₹1 lakh crore) in 2023** due to natural catastrophes. - These losses were significantly higher than the **10-year average of $8 billion (2013-2022)**. - The primary causes of these losses were floods in northern India and Sikkim, along with Tropical Cyclones (TC) **Biparjoy and Michaung.** [Enroll now for UPSC Online Course](https://www.pw.live/batches/upsc?utm_source=seo+upsc+batch&utm_medium=seo+upsc&utm_campaign=seo&utm_id=upsc) - **Key Causes of Economic Losses** - **Floods as a Major Cause of Losses**: - Floods account for approximately **63% of annual economic losses in India.** - **Major flood events include:** - The **Mumbai floods** of 2005, which caused economic losses of **$5.3 billion (in 2024 prices).** - The **Uttarakhand floods in 2013**, Jammu and Kashmir floods in 2014, Kerala floods in 2018, and northern India floods in 2023. - The **Chennai floods of 2015**, which caused economic losses of $6.6 billion (in 2024 prices). - **Tropical Cyclones (TC) and Tsunamis** - **Tropical Cyclones**: - **Cyclone Biparjoy (2023)**: Made landfall in Gujarat, shutting down ports (e.g., Mundra, Kandla) and causing widespread damage in Maharashtra and Rajasthan. - **Cyclone Michaung (2023)**: Resulted in extreme rainfall and significant losses in Chennai. - **Tsunamis**: Coastal regions, especially along the eastern coast, are prone to tsunamis. - The **2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami** caused widespread destruction in Tamil Nadu and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. - **Vulnerability**: India’s **5,700 km coastline** is highly exposed to cyclones and tsunamis, impacting urban centers, ports, and industries​​. - **Earthquake Vulnerability:** 58.6% of India’s landmass is prone to moderate to high-intensity earthquakes. - **New Delhi and Ahmedabad** are particularly exposed to earthquake risks. - Potential earthquake **epicentres** include the Himalayas, which could impact Delhi, and regions near urban centres like Mumbai or Delhi. - An earthquake similar to the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** could cause much greater losses today due to increased asset concentration. ## **About Natural Catastrophes** - A natural catastrophe is an **unexpected event, caused by nature**, such as an earthquake or flood, in which there is a lot of suffering, damage, or death. ### **Impacts of Natural Catastrophes** - #### **Economic Impacts** - **Direct losses:** Direct losses include damage to infrastructure, industries, homes, and agricultural lands. For instance, **₹1 lakh crore (USD 12 billion)** in economic loss was recorded in 2023 due to floods and cyclones. - **Indirect losses:** Indirect losses result from the disruption of **industrial and economic activities**, such as the shutdown of ports and supply chains during Cyclone Biparjoy in Gujarat, and a decline in agricultural productivity due to droughts and floods. - **Insurance gap:** Over **90% of natural disaster-related losses in India remain uninsured**, increasing financial strain on households and businesses. - #### **Humanitarian Impacts** - **Loss of Lives and Livelihoods:** Natural catastrophes lead to significant loss of lives and livelihoods. For example, the **2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami** and Northern India floods (2023) caused high casualties and displacement of people. - **Health and Vulnerable Groups**: These disasters also increase the risk of **waterborne diseases** and disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, including economically weaker sections, women, children, and differently-abled individuals.

**Disaster Management Act 2005:** The National Disaster Management Act was enacted in 2005, which brought a paradigm shift in India’s approach to disaster management. - The approach shifted to preparedness, prevention and planning from earlier response and relief centric approaches. - **Institutional Framework** - **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)**: Apex body chaired by the Prime Minister and coordinates disaster management efforts at the national level. - **State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs)**: Headed by Chief Ministers, implement disaster management policies and plans at the state level. - **District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs)**: Led by District Collectors; manage localized disaster responses and implement national and state policies at the district level. - **National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM):** It was created in 2009 to provide a comprehensive framework for disaster management in India. - It aims to shift focus from relief and response to a proactive strategy emphasizing prevention, mitigation, and preparedness. - **Vision**: To build a **safe and disaster-resilient India** through a holistic, multi-disaster-oriented approach. - **Key Objectives of NPDM** - **Promotion of Prevention and Preparedness**: Foster a culture of prevention, preparedness, and resilience across all levels of society. - **Integration into Developmental Planning**: Integrate disaster management strategies into the developmental planning process. - **Early Warning Systems**: Establish state-of-the-art forecasting and early warning systems supported by effective communication networks. - **Community Participation**: Enhance community participation to ensure last-mile connectivity in disaster management. - **Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure**: Develop disaster-resilient infrastructure and promote the use of sustainable technologies. - **National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) – 2016** - The **National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP)**, established in 2016, aligns with the **Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR)**, focusing on proactive disaster management rather than only response. - It was created by the **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)** as part of India’s disaster management strategy. - **Key Features of NDMP:** - **Risk Reduction and Preparedness**: Emphasizes preventing and mitigating disaster risks, building resilience across government levels and society. - **Four Priority Actions** (aligned with SFDRR): - **Understanding Disaster Risk**: Improve risk awareness, databases, and community engagement. - **Strengthening Disaster Risk Governance**: Build effective governance structures at national, state, and local levels. - **Investing in Resilience**: Strengthen infrastructure and minimize vulnerabilities. - **Enhancing Disaster Preparedness**: Focus on early warning systems, evacuation plans, and capacity-building. - **Role of Key Stakeholders**: Involves central ministries, state governments, local bodies, and community-based organizations in disaster management. -

This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment. In this challenging and uncertain environment, we have downgraded our growth projections. We are now forecasting that global growth will decline from 3.3% in 2024 to a modest 2.9% in 2025 and in 2026. Weakened economic prospects will be felt around the world, with almost no exception. Lower growth and less trade will hit incomes and slow job growth. Although inflation has recently declined in most countries, service price inflation remains stubbornly sticky and goods price inflation has increased slightly in many countries due to rising food prices. Protectionism is adding to these inflationary pressures, and inflation expectations have risen substantially in several countries. And even though we are still forecasting that inflation will come down to central bank targets by 2026 in most countries, it will now take longer to reach those targets. In the countries more affected by tariffs, inflation might even rise first before coming down. Risks have risen significantly too. There is the risk that protectionism and trade policy uncertainty will increase even further and that additional trade barriers might be introduced. According to our simulations, additional tariffs would further reduce global growth prospects and fuel inflation, dampening global growth even more. Fiscal risks are also increasing. Public debt levels are already elevated in many advanced and emerging market economies and spending pressures are rising in areas such as defence, investing in the green transition and costs related to the ageing of our societies. Debt service costs are rising too, further increasing pressures on public finances. High debt levels and tighter financial conditions pose particular risks for developing countries, many of which have large debt refinancing needs in the near future. Historically elevated equity valuations also increase the vulnerability to negative shocks in financial markets. In this context, policy has a crucial role to play to tackle uncertainty and boost growth. First and foremost, it is essential to avoid further trade fragmentation and trade barriers. Agreements to ease trade tensions and lower tariffs and other trade barriers will be instrumental to revive growth and investment and avoid rising prices. This is by far the most important policy priority. Second, given the recent inflationary pressures, monetary policy should remain vigilant. Still, if trade tensions are not intensified and inflation expectations remain anchored, policy rates can be reduced if inflation is projected to decline or remain subdued. Third, restoring fiscal discipline is key for countries to avoid fiscal sustainability problems and build buffers for future shocks. Given high debt levels and tremendous spending pressures, countries should ensure 10  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 that public debt is, indeed, on a sustainable path. Clear and credible medium-term fiscal plans are needed to show how countries intend to address pressures on public finances. Thus, reducing non-essential or inefficient expenditures by undertaking periodic spending reviews, targeting of policies, as well as raising revenues by reforming tax systems or broadening tax bases, are key policy instruments to help ensure fiscal sustainability. Finally, boosting investment will be instrumental to revive our economies and improve public finances. As we demonstrate in our special chapter, investment has been too low since the global financial crisis. Sluggish investment has lowered growth, productivity, and living standards. Business investment has fallen not only due to uncertainty and weakened demand, but also due to structural factors. This includes declining competitive pressures and financing frictions that have become more evident as a higher share of investment has been devoted to intangible assets (such as software, R&D, etc). At the same time, housing investment has been too feeble to avoid a substantial decline in housing affordability in many countries. And public investment has also been too weak for too long in many economies. In this Outlook, we provide recommendations for countries to foster investment and growth, including reforms enhancing competition and cutting regulatory costs, increasing public investment in energy, digital and critical infrastructures, addressing skills shortages and skills mismatches, and speeding up construction permits and licenses, as well as easing zoning and planning restrictions and rental regulations, to spur housing supply. All in all, in the current context, governments should work together to tackle uncertainty and pursue reforms to foster growth and jobs. Trade agreements to resolve existing tensions and lower or eliminate barriers should be accompanied by more efforts to enhance multilateral cooperation. Governments also need to tackle domestic challenges to boost growth and durably raise living standards, by fostering business and public investment and by pursuing productivity-enhancing structural reforms to improve the competitiveness of their economies. Policy has a crucial role to play in these challenging and uncertain times. 3 June 2025 Álvaro Pereira OECD Chief Economist  11 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Introduction The global outlook is becoming increasingly challenging. Substantial increases in barriers to trade, tighter financial conditions, weaker business and consumer confidence and heightened policy uncertainty will all have marked adverse effects on growth prospects if they persist. Higher trade costs, especially in countries raising tariffs, will also push up inflation, although their impact will be offset partially by weaker commodity prices. Global GDP growth is projected to slow from 3.3% in 2024 to 2.9% this year and in 2026 (Table 1.1), on the technical assumption that tariff rates as of mid-May are sustained despite ongoing legal challenges. The slowdown is concentrated in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with China and other economies expected to see smaller downward adjustments. Growth through 2025 is expected to be especially weak, with global output rising by just over 2½ per cent over the year to the fourth quarter, and by only 1.1% in the United States. Global trade growth is likely to slow substantially over the next two years, after significant front-loading ahead of expected tariff increases, and uncertainty is expected to hold back business investment. Fiscal easing will provide support in a handful of economies notably in China and Germany, where higher defence and infrastructure spending in 2026 could generate a significant upturn, but policy is likely to be mildly restrictive in many other countries. Annual headline inflation in the G20 economies is collectively expected to moderate from 6.2% to 3.6% in 2025 and 3.2% in 2026, but the United States is an important exception, with annual inflation expected to rise to just under 4% by the end of 2025 and remain above target in 2026. There are substantial risks to these projections, with the scale and duration of the expected downturn remaining highly uncertain. Further increases or swift changes in trade barriers, including through retaliatory actions, as well as more cautious behaviour by consumers and firms, or continued risk repricing in financial markets could all intensify the growth slowdown and trigger significant disruptions in highly interlinked cross-border supply chains. Rising inflation expectations by households could prolong inflationary pressures, especially in economies facing substantially higher trade costs or with still-tight labour markets, prompting more restrictive monetary policy and weakening growth prospects. Financial stability risks from still richly-valued and concentrated equity markets and high corporate financing needs could be triggered by additional risk repricing and amplified by forced asset sales by highly-leveraged non-bank financial intermediaries. On the upside, a reversal of the increase in trade barriers would support growth and reduce inflation, even if it did not immediately result in lower policy uncertainty. Steps to ease regulatory burdens, and an early resolution to conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, could also improve confidence and incentives to invest. 1. General assessment of the macroeconomic situation 12  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Against this backdrop, the key policy priorities are to ensure a lasting decline in trade tensions, policy uncertainty and inflation, establish a credible fiscal path to debt sustainability while providing temporary support to those vulnerable to economic shocks, and implement ambitious reforms to strengthen growth prospects and improve competitiveness. • Countries need to find ways of working together within the global trading system and to make trade policy more predictable. Agreements to ease trade tensions or potentially lower existing trade barriers would be welcome, improve policy certainty and strengthen the prospects for investment and growth. Steps to lower tariffs, deepen trade agreements or reduce barriers to trade in services would also benefit productivity and living standards. Key areas where opportunities exist for services trade reforms include further improvements in trade facilitation, reductions in regulatory barriers that impede access to national markets, and initiatives to enhance the cross-border digital delivery of services. • Central banks should remain vigilant given heightened uncertainty and the potential for initial increases in trade costs to push up wage and price pressures more generally. The balance of risks for central banks will vary across countries, with the downside effects of higher uncertainty and weaker exports likely to be the key influences on policy decisions in most countries, but upside inflationary pressures being a more pertinent concern in countries raising tariffs. Provided inflation expectations remain well anchored, and trade tensions do not intensify further, policy rate reductions should continue in economies in which underlying inflation is projected to moderate or remain subdued. • Faced with multiple spending pressures, governments need to ensure long-term debt sustainability and maintain the ability to react to future shocks. Stronger efforts to contain and reallocate spending and enhance revenues, set within credible medium-term country-specific adjustment paths, will be essential for debt burdens to remain manageable and to conserve the resources required to address longer term spending challenges. Higher debt service costs and some pressing spending needs, such as plans to raise defence spending substantially, are already forcing hard choices in some countries about the pace and composition of fiscal adjustment and limiting room for budgetary manoeuvre. In the near term, the automatic fiscal stabilisers should be allowed to operate fully to help cushion the adverse impact of trade tensions and elevated uncertainty. Targeted and well-designed support measures may also be needed to help companies but should be only temporary, as structural policy solutions are key if the adverse effects on external competitiveness are likely to endure. • Rising protectionism, geopolitical uncertainty and weak growth prospects reinforce the need for ambitious structural policy reforms that strengthen living standards and promote economic competitiveness. A strong focus should be placed on policies to revive business investment, innovation and labour productivity, particularly ones that have a limited near-term fiscal cost. Elevated policy uncertainty, declining business dynamism and perceived difficulties in funding future investment in intangible assets are factors that need to be addressed in many OECD economies to strengthen investment growth.  13 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Table 1.1. Global GDP growth is projected to slow StatLink 2https://stat.link/57dr8i Recent Developments Global growth has been resilient but trade policy changes raise new challenges After finishing 2024 on a sound footing, global GDP growth eased in the first quarter of 2025 (Figure 1.1, Panel A). However, economic developments were obscured by some front-loading of purchases ahead of the introduction of announced tariff rate increases. In the advanced economies, economic growth turned negative in the United States and Japan, but this was largely due to a surge in goods imports, with indicators of domestic demand growth holding up in both economies. Real GDP also contracted in the first quarter in Korea and several European economies, including Portugal, Norway, Slovenia, Denmark and Hungary. In contrast, output growth strengthened in Germany and the United Kingdom, partly reflecting stronger export growth, and remained solid in Spain and Ireland. Most emerging-market economies generally continued to expand at a solid pace in the first quarter of 2025. In China, growth slowed a little but remained resilient, supported by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy and rapid export growth. There were also ongoing expansions in India, Indonesia and several Latin American economies, including Chile and Colombia. In Mexico, output growth picked up, helped by an improvement in agricultural output following weather-related disruptions in late 2024.

Per cent 14  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The impact of recent increases in bilateral tariff rates between the United States and its trading partners is likely to be increasingly evident in global economic indicators. These policy changes have coincided with a marked increase in newspaper-based measures of trade policy uncertainty (Figure 1.1, Panel B). As of mid-May, the United States had raised the tariff rate on most merchandise imports from China by 30% points, with China raising its tariff rate on merchandise imports from the United States by 10% points. Both countries had bilateral tariff rates of about 21% at the start of the year (Bown, 2025). The new rates are significantly below the peak bilateral tariff rates announced in April, which exceeded 100%, but it remains possible that those higher rates could be reinstated later this year. In addition, tariffs have been announced on those United States imports from Canada and Mexico not compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, with Canada taking targeted retaliatory action in response. The United States has also imposed a default tariff increase of 10 percentage points on all other trading partners, with the possibility that many countries could face substantially higher tariffs from July 2025. Certain products have been excluded from these increases, including United States imports of automobiles and automobile parts and steel and aluminium products, which face a separate tariff of 25%. Ongoing legal challenges bring additional uncertainty on some of these tariff measures. Taken together, the new tariffs introduced by the United States this year up to mid-May are estimated to have raised the (ex-ante) effective tariff rate on US merchandise imports to 15.4%, from just over 2% in 2024, taking it to the highest rate since 1938 (Box 1.1).1 The US tariffs, together with retaliatory action by China, as well as more limited action by Canada, means that trade equivalent to over 2% of world GDP is now directly facing higher tariffs, pointing to much greater disruption than during the US-China trade tensions in 2018-19. If current applied tariffs are sustained, effective tariff rates are likely to fall over time, as trade in more heavily-tariffed goods is likely to slow. Figure 1.1. Global growth was holding up ahead of recent trade policy announcements Note: In Panel B, data are standardised from January 1960.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/cieo1r Higher bilateral tariff rates are a drag on global activity and add to trade costs, raising the price of covered imported final goods for consumers and intermediate inputs for businesses, particularly in countries where tariffs are imposed. The initial effect on prices is likely to be felt close to the time of the tariffs being 1 Effective tariff rates weight the rise in a given tariff line with the share those imports constitute; for the purposes of these calculations 2024 US Census Bureau data are used.  15 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 implemented, with the full impacts on output growth taking longer to materialise. Tariffs raise revenues for the government imposing them, but may also create distortions. The use of these additional revenues will condition the size and distribution of the economic impacts. At the same time, the expected slowing in economic growth in countries imposing tariffs will reduce other tax revenues. The impacts of recent trade policy changes may be more pronounced given heightened policy uncertainty, with elevated caution by businesses and consumers further weighing on investment and consumption growth.2 Taken together, higher tariffs and heightened uncertainty would be expected to weaken trade activity, although there is an upside risk in the very near term if exporters further bring forward trade to try and avoid the possibility of reciprocal or sectoral tariff rates being raised further in the next 2-3 months. 2 Heightened uncertainty will also reduce trade through a variety of channels, including through the effect on investment and raising the costs of inventories (Novy and Taylor, 2020; Limao and Maggi, 2015). 16  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Box 1.1. The impact of US tariff policy changes will be significant This box outlines the main tariff changes implemented by the United States, the impact on the effective tariff rates across countries and the goods trade that might be affected. The Box reflects the tariffs applied as of mid-May, despite some uncertainty pertaining to ongoing legal challenges. The extent of recent tariff changes from the United States and China is significantly larger than the previous episode of US-China trade tensions in 2018, with new tariff increases covering a broader range of goods. Even though bilateral goods trade between the United States and China has declined as a share of their total trade since 2018, it still represented around 2.5% of world goods trade in 2023 according to the OECD Balanced International Merchandise Trade dataset. Taking into account zero\u0002rated items as well as tariffs on United States imports from other countries, trade equivalent to 2.2% of world GDP will be affected by the new tariffs (Figure 1.2, Panel A). In 2024, according to US data, China accounted for 6.9% of the United States’ merchandise exports, and 13.3% of US merchandise imports. As a result of the combined trade policy changes introduced since January this year, the average effective tariff from the United States will rise to historically high levels, based on 2024 import patterns (Figure 1.2, Panel B). US imports of cars and car parts, and steel and aluminium products are now subject to an additional 25% tariff. In addition, tariffs have been raised on all countries by the United States, but with some sectoral and product exemptions. Collectively, the distribution of these tariff increases, as of mid-May, differs widely by country (Figure 1.2, Panel C). • Announced tariff increases have been highest for China, at 30%. • Canada and Mexico also face higher tariffs, but a different tariff regime. They do not qualify for the exemptions granted to other countries, but rather face tariffs of either 25% or 0%, depending on whether their merchandise exports to the United States are compliant with the United States Mexico Canada trade agreement (USMCA). On average, around one-half of their imports into the United States are thought to be USMCA-compliant at present, with compliance depending on the extent of local content and the filing of relevant rules-of-origin documentation. • The high proportion of cars and parts in total exports to the United States raises the effective rates faced by Mexico, as well as a number of Asian and European countries, including Japan, Korea, Germany and the Slovak Republic. For Canada, the impact of the higher effective rate on cars and car parts is offset by the 10% tariff applied on its energy exports to the United States. • In contrast, some products currently remain exempt from tariffs, including pharmaceuticals, semi-conductors and other zero-rated items such as copper. This helps to lower considerably the effective US tariff on imports from countries such as Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The United States is an important export market for a number of countries, accounting for around 75% of goods exports for Mexico and Canada, 19% for Japan, 13% for China and 10% for Germany in 2023 (Figure 1.3). The importance of exports for overall activity also varies greatly by country. Exports to the United States are equivalent to over 20% of GDP in its North American trading partners, over 5% of GDP for many smaller open Asian economies and Korea, and between 3 and 4% of GDP for many European countries, including Germany and many of its key European supply chain partners. Exports from emerging-market economies such as China, India, South Africa and Türkiye represent a smaller share of their domestic output. In value-added terms, the extent of direct exposure to the United States via exports is often smaller because of offsetting effects from intermediate inputs used in production for final exports. However, indirect exposures can also be significant due to integrated cross-border supply chains in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Data on the extent of such exposures is less timely, but highlight the comparatively  17 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 high exposures of Mexico, Canada, Ireland, Korea and some other Latin American economies, such as Chile, Colombia and Costa Rica (Figure 1.4). Imports into the United States also include around 0.5% of US value-added that was previously exported from the United States. Combined sector exposures are likely to be largest for the wholesale and retail sector, as well as cars and other manufacturing industries such as ICT, machinery and electrical equipment. In addition to weaker trade volumes, domestic price increases are likely to follow higher tariffs, although the exact magnitude is subject to some uncertainty. Around 10% of the consumer basket in the United States is imported, directly and indirectly, before taking into account food and energy (Barbiero and Stein, 2025). It is likely that most of the impact of tariff increases will be borne by consumers and businesses, as occurred in the United States in 2018/19 when US tariffs on Chinese imports rose (Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal, 2022; Amiti et al., 2020 and Cavallo et al., 2021). The extent of price increases faced by consumers will depend on whether retailers just raise prices to cover the higher dollar cost or whether they maintain their current price-cost margin. For example, if retailers just passed\u0002through the additional costs of a 60% tariff increase on China and a 10% tariff rise on the rest of the world, consumer prices could be expected to rise by 1.4 percentage points. By contrast, if retailers maintained a constant margin of selling prices over purchasing costs, consumer prices could rise 2.2 percentage points (Barbiero and Stein, 2025). The eventual cost increases to consumers might further be mitigated by dollar appreciation, or if exporters or domestic producers lower their margins. However, experience from the 2018-2019 tariffs showed that even local producers who are not affected by imports may raise prices when most major competitors are being forced to raise costs, without fear of losing market share (Flaaen et al, 2020). There is also evidence that price increases tended to be rapid, often occurring within two to three months (Minton and Somale, 2025). There are signs that a similar pattern may emerge this year. Minton and Somale (2025) estimate that US consumers already faced a 0.3 percentage point rise in core goods prices in March stemming from tariff increases on Chinese goods in February and March. Carvallo et al (2025) also find marked increases in US retailers’ prices of goods imported from China. Survey evidence suggests that US firms which rely on imported inputs tend to have markedly higher inflation expectations for 2025 than firms with low or no imported inputs (Edwards et al, 2025) and most importers expect to pass on cost increases over the next two years, in response to a range of tariff scenarios (Andrade et al., 2025). In other countries, weaker economic activity in the United States may exert downward pressure on commodity prices and selling prices as exporters seek to aggressively expand into new markets. On the other hand, currency depreciation due to lower risk appetite and fears of further tariff action to protect industries may limit the extent of price discounting. 18  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.2. Recent trade policy announcements imply substantial change in effective tariffs Note: Estimates based on trade policy announcements as of 14 May 2025. Panel A based on the USD value of affected imported US goods at the HS8 digit level, scaled by the share of nominal US goods imports as a share of nominal world GDP. Retaliation includes announced measures by Canada (USD 65bn) and China (all US exports), scaled by the share of nominal US goods imports as a share of nominal world GDP. Panel B based on the US International Trade Commission (USITC) estimate of the average effective tariffs until 2024. For 2025, the average tariff rate is calculated based on HS classifications of tariff-affected items matched to US Census Bureau data for 2024 import weights of product categories. Panel C excludes any estimate of the impact of the de minimis trade policy changes. The net sector-specific adjustment change includes a 25% tariff for listed cars and parts except for US-related content, provided that meets a minimum 20% (Canadian cars are assumed to have 25% US content, Mexico 20% and rest of world 0%, rounding results from the 2020 TiVA tables); a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium products; 0% tariff increases on any items listed in the official exclusions to the tariffs for all countries other than Canada and Mexico; and a 10% increase in tariff rates on all other goods for all countries, with the exception of Canada, Mexico and China. Mexico and Canada face a 25% tariff, except for energy and potash products from Canada which face a 10% tariff, and USMCA compliant goods which face a 0% tariff. Assuming 50% compliance, this equates to an effective tariff rate of 12.5% for all non-car goods. The United Kingdom is assumed to have a 10% tariff on cars based on the quota specified in the announced US-UK trade agreement, which accounted for 80% of the cars and parts exports, and 0% tariff on steel and aluminium. Data classifications are based on HS8 lists as published by the US administration. Weights are calculated based on 2024 US Census Bureau product level data for US imports, by country.

Consumer confidence was already below long-run average levels in most economies but has shown further notable declines in Sweden, the United States, Lithuania and South Africa in the early months of 2025 (Figure 1.5, Panel A). In contrast, confidence has recently picked up in Türkiye, Poland and Chile. Empirical estimates suggest that the sharp fall in consumer confidence in the United States is mostly attributable to the increase in policy uncertainty since December 2024 (Figure 1.5, Panel B). The pace of retail sales has eased since last year in the United States and the euro area but has displayed greater resilience in China (Figure 1.5, Panel C). Business surveys suggest a slowdown in Canada, Mexico, Spain and the United States since the start of 2025 (Figure 1.5, Panel D), with available measures suggesting wide dispersion in firms’ expectations regarding the duration of tariffs. However, new orders for manufacturing goods remained strong in some euro area economies, including Germany and France, sustaining the pick-up seen since the start of the year. Some of the ongoing strength in manufacturing activity in these economies likely reflects a temporary surge in demand for tradeable goods given the perceived risk of higher tariff rates from July 2025. Figure 1.5. Recent economic indicators have weakened in several large economies Note: In Panel A, the most recent data are for April 2025, except for Chile, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa (March 2025), and Switzerland (February 2025). The latest information for Canada refers to the first quarter of 2025, and relates to 'Perceiving their financial situation is currently deteriorating'. The scenario in Panel B is based on the results from a cross-country model that regresses consumer confidence on developments in core, food and energy inflation, the unemployment rate, the share market index, house prices and the economic policy uncertainty index. The scenario assumes all else constant apart from economic policy uncertainty which remains at the level observed in December 2024. Panel D shows PMI manufacturing output for Mexico.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/yqop58  21 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Merchandise trade volumes rose strongly in late 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, helped by front-loading, with some exporters bringing forward planned shipments to the United States ahead of expected tariff increases (Figure 1.6, Panel A). The surge in US imports has been most apparent in industrial supplies, including steel and aluminium, in late 2024, and pharmaceutical goods in the first quarter of 2025, and has been accompanied by rising inventory growth for manufacturers and many retailers. International air freight traffic also rose in March and April, likely due to front-loading. More broadly, global container traffic continued to expand in the first quarter of 2025 and survey measures of manufacturing export orders have improved steadily in the advanced economies, with a normalisation in Germany (Figure 1.6, Panel B). Nonetheless, some signs are emerging that weaker performance is expected. Global container prices in April were 40% lower than at the start of the year. Routes between Shanghai and the United States have been heavily affected, both by the introduction of tariffs, which precipitated sharp declines, and the recent reduction in US-China tariff rates, which resulted in a 30% rebound in container shipping rates since the announcement – although rates remain 30% lower than at the end of 2024.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/j3mb1t Financial market volatility has subsided but higher risk aversion persists After pronounced turbulence in April, financial markets have normalised, with a strong rebound in global equity prices, declining equity and bond market volatility and a broad stabilisation of sovereign bond yields. Nonetheless, financial market conditions remain tighter than in late 2024 (Figure 1.7), as market volatility remains elevated and signs of risk aversion persist in some market segments, including for lower-rated corporate bonds and global companies exposed to the US market. In contrast to typical episodes of risk repricing, the US dollar has depreciated since the start of April, with investors significantly reducing their exposure to US financial assets. 22  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.7.

Equity markets recovered in May, after experiencing a sharp decline across several advanced and emerging-market economies following the US announcement of larger-than-expected tariffs on all trading partners in early April. Equity market performance in 2025 has been strongest in Europe and in selected emerging-market economies, particularly Brazil and Mexico. In Japan and the United States, equity valuations have essentially caught up to their levels at end-December 2024. Equity risk premia have recently declined after moderate increases in the United States, the United Kingdom and in Europe, while asset valuations continue to remain stretched. There are persisting signs of some differences across companies according to their potential exposure to tariff barriers. Since mid-February, the equity prices of companies more highly exposed to the US market have underperformed others (Figure 1.8, Panel A). The magnitude of the decline has varied across regions, with the largest impact in China and Asia-Pacific economies. European companies have been affected to a lesser extent. As the announced tariffs have been relatively broad, the negative effects have weighed on equity prices in most sectors. The equity prices of US companies with significant international exposure also initially underperformed their more domestically focused counterparts in March and April, particularly in consumer goods and industrial sectors (Figure 1.8, Panel B), although this has subsequently moderated as the perceived risk of widespread retaliatory trade policy measures by other countries on imports from the United States has eased.  23 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.8. Equity prices of companies sensitive to US tariffs have underperformed Note: Based on data up to 27 May 2025. Panel A displays two global non-financial corporate equity indices, excluding US companies. The first index reflects the stock performance of firms that are particularly sensitive to recent US policy changes, while the second represents the broader non-financial corporate equity market. Sensitive corporates are defined as ones with sales in the United States equal or exceeding 20% of their total sales. Panel B shows equity indices of internationally exposed and not internationally-exposed US non-financial corporates along with the broader non-financial corporate US equity benchmark. Internationally exposed US corporates are defined as those with international sales equal or exceeding 20% of their total sales. Corporates that are not internationally exposed have a ratio of international sales to total sales of 0%. The seven vertical dotted lines refer to five specific dates: 3 February 2025, the first trading day following the announcement of 25% US tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% on imports on China; 11 February 2025, when a reinstatement of 25% US tariffs on all steel imports and a plan to increase tariffs on aluminium imports to 25% from March was announced; 27 February 2025, when an intention to implement a higher tariff on EU goods and introduce levies on other major trading partners was announced; 4 March 2025, when tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China were partially implemented; 2 April 2025, when the US announced reciprocal tariffs that raised tariffs on most imports from all trading partners; 9 April 2025, when the US announced an increase of the US tariff rate on China to 145% and lowered reciprocal tariff rates on other partners for 90 days; and 12 May 2025, when the United State and China announced substantially lower tariffs, effective for an initial 90 -days.

Despite several episodes of volatility, long-term sovereign bond yields in most advanced economies currently stand at levels broadly similar to those recorded at the end of December 2024. After considerable fluctuations in April, yields have however increased in some advanced economies in recent weeks, notably in the United States where yields have been pushed up by a rising term premium amid concerns about policy uncertainty and public debt sustainability. In contrast, after a significant rise in March following the announcement of substantial additional expenditures on defence and infrastructure in Germany in the wake of the debt brake reform, long-term sovereign bond yields in the euro area have since declined, as investors have been seeking safe-haven assets. At the same time, policy rate cuts have continued in most advanced economies and some emerging-market economies, and markets continue to price in further rate reductions in most advanced economies. Amid higher volatility in equity and currency markets, changes in sovereign bond yields in emerging-market economies have been relatively muted. Spreads on USD-denominated sovereign bonds have mostly reversed their increases in early April and are generally around their 2019 levels in major emerging-market economies. In Mexico, long-term yields have steadily declined over the year, reflecting the weaker economic outlook. In Brazil, long-term yields have also recently declined, partly due to expectations of easing inflationary pressures, but are still around end-2024 levels and relatively high. In Colombia as well as South Africa and Türkiye, bond yields have risen in 2025 and are, on average, now higher than in the 2010s. In contrast, bond yields in many Asian emerging-market economies are around or below the average levels observed during the previous decade. Chinese long-term bond yields have weakened in April, with the expansion of fiscal support offset by the higher trade tensions and monetary policy easing, and are close to record lows. Long-term bond yields in India and smaller open economies such as Malaysia and Thailand have fallen since early 2025. 24  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Corporate credit spreads over risk-free rates have narrowed from their peak levels in 2025, but remain elevated, particularly for lower-rated corporate bonds (Figure 1.9, Panel B). This signals growing market concerns over riskier assets, especially in the United States. Spreads on corporate bonds and leveraged loans had previously been at low levels, encouraging strong issuance but also raising risks of a sharp repricing if downside risks materialised. Leveraged loan issuance in the first quarter of 2025 was 40% higher than a year earlier. However, issuance of high-yield corporate bonds of the lowest ratings has been muted in the United States since early April. This freeze poses risks for private equity firms that often depend on the junk bond market for funding acquisitions, as well as for banks providing short-term loans for such transactions before firms secure longer-term financing. Bank lending and deposit rates have declined broadly in line with policy rate reductions, with signs of improvement in credit demand. However, credit standards for loans to firms tightened slightly in the euro area in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a rise in perceived risks about the economic outlook. Figure 1.9. Volatility has eased, but lower-rated corporate bond spreads remain elevated Note: Based on data up to 27 May 2025. In Panel A, the implied volatility as measured by the VIX index can be interpreted as the market expectation of risk (future volatility). The MOVE index is a yield curve weighted index of the normalised implied volatility on 1-month Treasury options which are weighted on the 2-, 5-, 10- and 30-year contracts. Panel B shows option-adjusted spreads (OAS), which measure the difference in yield between a high-yield rated bond with an embedded option (such as a callable bond) and a sovereign bond. The difference between OAS of CCC and BB to B rated US corporate bonds is shown. It indicates the risk premium for investors in high-risk versus lower-risk high-yield corporate bonds.

Labour markets were easing but remained tight before new tariff measures Employment conditions were already easing in many economies before the announcement of new trade policy measures, but labour markets generally remained in solid health. Median annualised employment growth in the final quarter of 2024 was 0.3% in the OECD, down from 0.8% in the first half of the year. Employment growth had also started to slow in some large non-OECD economies, including Brazil. Nonetheless, employment as a share of the working-age population was generally high compared with the pre-pandemic period, reflecting both relatively low unemployment and increased participation rates (Figure 1.10, Panel A). This was often enabled by older workers significantly increasing participation, such as in Czechia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain (Figure 1.10, Panel B). While the employment effects of the new tariffs and heightened policy uncertainty remain unclear, employment has fallen in recent months in some economies, including Canada and Japan. Employment conditions from business surveys have also eased notably, including in the United States, China, Canada, Mexico and India.  25 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.10.

Source: OECD Labour Market database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/zjyf1c Nominal wage growth was moderating at the start of the year, but remained high in many regions compared to the pre-pandemic period. In most advanced economies, strong wage growth accompanied by limited productivity gains had kept unit labour cost growth above levels consistent with central bank inflation targets. Strong minimum wage increases were supporting ongoing wage momentum in some European economies, and robust base pay growth in Japan was accompanied by high winter bonus payments and a strong outcome in the annual wage negotiations for the 2025 financial year. Real wages were growing robustly at the end of 2024 and had returned to or surpassed pre-pandemic levels in most OECD countries following gradual disinflation. The imposition of new tariffs may result in stronger nominal wage demands as households respond to higher final goods prices. For example, around three quarters of respondents to the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations, undertaken in January and February 2025, expected their cost of living to increase because of the trade conflict. Inflationary pressures have resurfaced in some economies Inflationary pressures were still lingering in many economies early in 2025, with inflation often above target levels (Figure 1.11, Panel A). In the OECD, services price inflation remained elevated, largely due to stickiness in housing cost growth. At the same time, goods inflation had begun to rise, albeit from very low levels, primarily owing to stronger food price inflation (Figure 1.11, Panel B). The recent strengthening of food prices was most evident in Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as in some emerging-market economies like Costa Rica and Colombia. Overall, inflation developments in emerging\u0002market economies have been more disparate. Despite having eased, annual headline inflation in Argentina and Türkiye was still tracking at double-digit rates, respectively, in early 2025. In contrast, inflation in China remained close to zero as of April. 26  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Business surveys suggest manufacturing input and output prices have moved higher in advanced economies this year, particularly in Canada and the United States (Figure 1.11, Panels C and D). However, such measures do not suggest upward momentum in final services prices so far. Increased import tariffs are expected to induce an upward adjustment to price levels in the levying country. The persistence of the inflationary impact will depend on whether this is accompanied by higher nominal wage demands and increases in firm mark-ups. The magnitude of such second-round effects is likely to be more modest in economies with well-anchored inflation expectations. Figure 1.11. Inflation remains high with goods inflation having recently picked up Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; OECD Consumer Prices database; S&P Global; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/nelod7 Aggregate inflation expectations have moved higher in some economies. Financial market measures of 10-year breakeven inflation in major economies have not moved greatly, including in the United States (Figure 1.12, Panel A). However, short-run household inflation expectations have spiked in a few economies in recent months, most notably in the United States, but also in Canada and the United Kingdom (Figure 1.12, Panel B). This may partly reflect the recent inflation increase in items salient to household budgets, such as food, as well as the anticipated impact of higher tariffs on inflation. More granular data of both one-year-ahead and three-year-ahead inflation expectations highlight that the aggregate movements have reflected an increasing proportion of households expecting inflation to exceed 4% (see Box 1.2 below). Corporate inflation expectations have also increased in several advanced economies, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan (Figure 1.12, Panels C and D).  27 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.12.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/lxz1mo Projections Global GDP growth is projected to slow from 3.3% in 2024, to 2.9% in 2025 and 2026 (Figure 1.13, Panel A; Table 1.1), with weakening economic prospects particularly evident in North America and some Asian economies, especially China (Figure 1.13, Panel B). On a Q4/Q4 basis, global growth is expected to slip to just 2.6% by the fourth quarter of 2025, from 3.4% in 2024, before recovering to 3% through 2026. These projections are based on a technical assumption that the bilateral tariff rates prevailing in mid-May persist through the rest of 2025 and 2026, despite ongoing legal challenges. Higher bilateral tariff rates and elevated policy uncertainty are expected to weigh on growth in business investment and trade. At the same time, consumer spending is also projected to soften in most economies as fragile sentiment and lingering cost of living pressures are compounded by the impact of higher trade costs on final goods prices and, in some countries, weaker labour market developments. The revised global growth projections are weaker than in the December 2024 OECD Economic Outlook and also the version of the March 2025 OECD Interim Economic Outlook projections that adopted the most comparable technical assumptions related to trade barriers (the “light tariff scenario”; Figure 1.13, Panel C). Inflation in G20 countries is expected to moderate gradually through 2026, with the inflationary impact from higher trade barriers offset by lower oil prices over 2025-26 and softer growth (Figure 1.13, Panel D; Annex 1.A). The United States is a key exception, with annual headline and core inflation now projected to peak at around 3.9% and 4.0% respectively in the fourth quarter of 2025 and remain above target in 2026. 28  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.13.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/4w3gms Central banks in many OECD economies are assumed to further lower monetary policy rates to mitigate the severity of the slowdown in economic growth and employment conditions. However, policy rates are expected to remain unchanged in 2025 in the United States given the upside risks to inflation. Another exception is Japan, where persisting inflation is anticipated to warrant continued gradual policy interest rate increases. Fiscal policy is assumed to tighten modestly in most of the large OECD economies over 2025-26, with the sustainability of public debt a common concern, but less so in many of the smaller economies. However, Germany’s reform of its fiscal rules and planned increase in defence and infrastructure spending are assumed to result in a sizeable stimulus in 2026, and much stronger public investment. In the United States, the assumed enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is also expected to result in some additional fiscal support in 2026. Most emerging-market economies are assumed to have a broadly neutral fiscal policy stance with some further monetary policy easing. China is an exception, with significant further fiscal expansion expected in 2025, with policy rates expected to be kept around currently low levels. The prospects for individual major economies and regions are as follows: • In the United States, output growth is expected to slow significantly due to the substantially higher effective tariff rate on imports, combined with retaliatory measures from some trading partners, elevated policy uncertainty and softer real income growth. In addition, a further slowdown in net  29 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 immigration and reduction in the federal workforce are anticipated to moderate growth. On an annual basis, GDP growth is projected to weaken from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, with growth in the year to the fourth quarter of 2025 declining to just 1.1%. Similarly, new trade restrictions are anticipated to weigh on activity in Canada, with monetary policy assumed to provide only modest further support amid lingering inflation concerns. Canadian GDP growth is projected to fall from 1.5% in 2024 to 1.0% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026. In both economies, a sizeable price level change is projected, with inflation anticipated to spike in mid-2025 before moderating towards target over time. • The Japanese economy is expected to expand at a moderate pace, with private consumption growth supported by strong wage gains and business investment growth underpinned by healthy profits and government subsidies. Offsetting forces will be subdued external demand amid new trade restrictions and elevated trade policy uncertainty, with GDP growth projected to moderate from 0.7% in 2025 to 0.4% in 2026. In Korea, growth is projected to recover, with stronger real incomes and improving labour market conditions supporting household spending. After dipping from 2.1% in 2024 to 1.0% in 2025, GDP growth is projected to be 2.2% in 2026. • Growth in the euro area is projected to remain modest at 1.0% in 2025, after 0.8% in 2024, before picking up to 1.2% in 2026, with increased trade frictions being offset by ongoing capital spending from NextGenerationEU funds, resilient labour markets and a recent easing of credit conditions. Additional cuts to monetary policy rates and the projected fiscal expansion in Germany are also expected to support growth, particularly next year. Modest increases in unemployment rates are expected to be accompanied by further moderation in wage growth. Price pressures are expected to abate further, with headline inflation in the euro area projected to be back around target in 2026. In the United Kingdom, growth is projected to be around estimated potential, at 1.3% in 2025 and 1.0% in 2026, as trade tensions and elevated uncertainty offset the positive impact from last autumn’s budgetary measures on government consumption and investment. • In China, after robust growth at the start of 2025, the tightening of bilateral tariff rates and the planned elimination of the de minimis exemption on imports to the United States, combined with retaliatory trade measures, will weaken output growth. However, this is expected to be partly offset by domestic fiscal stimulus focused on government subsidies for consumer goods and social transfers. Real GDP growth is projected to ease from 5.0% in 2024 to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026, with increased trade costs and recent increases in global food prices pushing inflation up from its currently low levels. • India and Indonesia are projected to continue to experience strong and broadly stable economic growth. While easing monetary policy will aid ongoing expansions in both economies, higher tariffs in the United States, global trade policy uncertainty, and domestic fiscal policy uncertainty in Indonesia, will have an offsetting effect. In India, economic growth is projected to be 6.3% in FY2025-26 and 6.4% in FY2026-27, while the Indonesian economy is expected to grow by 4.7% in 2025 and 4.8% in 2026. Inflation in both economies is projected to remain largely benign, although past currency depreciation in Indonesia will feed through into higher domestic prices and push up inflation this year. • Growth in Mexico is projected to slow further in 2025 as higher trade barriers are combined with subdued increases in public spending. However, monetary policy easing will be a supportive factor, with output growth projected to be 0.4% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026. In Brazil, growth is also expected to slow from 3.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026, as restrictive monetary policy and new trade barriers are only partially offset by the positive impact of expansionary fiscal policy. Inflation is projected to remain high but to fall back into the central bank target range in the second half of 2026. 30  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The substantial changes to trade policies up to mid-May, with a technical assumption that they persist through the remainder of 2025 and 2026 are a significant drag to world trade in goods and services. Global trade is now projected to grow by 2.8% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026, 0.8 and 1.3 percentage points lower respectively than the projections in the December 2024 OECD Economic Outlook. Much of the decline reflects lower trade in the United States, China, and regional partners who are heavily integrated into their global supply chains (Figure 1.14, Panel A). In 2025, the introduction of US import tariffs and greater trade policy uncertainty will also weigh on Europe, but a pick-up in domestic growth in Germany in 2026 should fuel a recovery in intra-EU trade. The front-loading of exports to the United States in late 2024 and early 2025, together with a continued expansion of services trade, limit the overall decline in annual trade volume growth in 2025. Nonetheless, quarterly trade growth is expected to remain weak for some time and global trade volumes in the fourth quarter of 2026 are 2.1% lower than previously projected (Figure 1.14, Panel B). Many emerging-market economies, particularly commodity exporters, are expected to have much softer export growth as demand from both China and the United States is lower. However, some countries such as Argentina and Chile are relatively insulated, with half of their exports to the United States tariff exempt. Figure 1.14.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/9we63h Despite the sizeable shifts in world trade volumes, changes in national current account balances are expected to be relatively limited (Figure 1.15, Panel A). Some key surplus countries such as China see a sharp slowdown in imports alongside exports, whilst in the United States weaker export growth limits the improvement in the overall current account that would have been generated by weaker import growth. One exception is Germany, where fiscal policy changes are expected to boost domestic demand and raise import growth even as export growth weakens due to trade policy changes; this results in a lower current account surplus. Overall, most countries’ current account balances are a smaller share of world GDP than prior to the global financial crisis, and remain largely unchanged over 2025 and 2026 (Figure 1.15, Panel B).  31 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.15.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/eron8u Employment growth in the OECD is expected to weaken, with the annual pace of employment gains in the median OECD country projected to be 0.7% over 2025-26, down from 1% in 2024 (Figure 1.16, Panel A). Employment growth is projected to be more resilient in some non-OECD emerging economies, such as India and South Africa, but to continue to slow in China as the ageing population further reduces labour supply. Labour force growth is also generally projected to ease from its recent fast pace, with migration inflows moderating in some economies. Consequently, the median unemployment rate across OECD economies is projected to remain broadly stable over the projection horizon. However, higher unemployment is projected in the United States as growth slows, with the unemployment rate rising towards 4½ per cent in the first half of 2026 before starting to moderate. With demand and supply in labour markets in better balance, nominal wage growth is projected to continue to ease in most economies (Figure 1.16, Panel B). This will combine with a projected improvement in labour productivity growth to facilitate further easing in unit labour cost growth and, in turn, reduce inflationary pressures. Further declines in headline inflation are projected in most advanced and emerging-market economies where inflation is currently exceeding the central bank target (Figure 1.17). In addition to the United States, exceptions include South Africa, where inflation will be pushed up by an increase in value added tax and the narrowing output gap, and Brazil, where a recent upturn in services inflation will keep annual inflation high despite a projected fall in quarterly inflation throughout 2026. In the euro area, inflation will remain relatively elevated in a number of economies with tight labour markets, including Latvia, Lithuania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. 32  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.16.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/0x94gc  33 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Risks Growth could be hit by more restrictive trade policies, prolonged uncertainty and tighter financial conditions A key risk is that bilateral tariff rates are raised further on merchandise imports into the United States, potentially prompting retaliatory measures by trade partners. Such developments would be likely to intensify risk repricing in financial markets and prolong policy uncertainty. This would also sap confidence, add to the downward pressures on corporate and household spending around the world, and weaken global demand for many key commodities. A set of illustrative simulations using the NiGEM global macroeconomic model in forward-looking mode highlights the different near-term effects that some of these developments might have (Figure 1.18): • A scenario in which US bilateral tariff rates are raised further by an additional 10 percentage points on all countries could lower global output by just under 0.3% by the second year, with a larger fall of 0.6% in the United States. Inflation would also be higher, rising by an average 0.8 percentage points per annum in the United States in the first two years and by close to 0.5 percentage points per annum in the world. While the strongest effects are felt in the United States, weaker US import demand reduces export growth in all trading partners, and an appreciation in the dollar effective exchange rate of close to 4% mitigates the inflationary impact in the United States but raises import prices elsewhere. • The initial shock to growth would be amplified if accompanied by a further deterioration in global equity markets and heightened risk premia due to greater uncertainty, and greater precautionary saving by consumers. In the illustrative scenario, equity prices are assumed to fall by 10%, investment risk premia increase by 50 basis points and household saving rates to rise by 1 percentage point, with these shocks lasting for two years. Collectively, the combined shocks could push global output down by around 1.2% by the second year, with larger declines in many advanced economies. The additional demand shocks are deflationary, reducing both consumer spending and investment, and so the impact of higher trade costs on inflation would be reduced, with the increase in global inflation slowing to an average 0.2 percentage points per annum over the first two years. • Commodity prices are likely to be an additional shock absorber, with weaker global demand likely to push down prices, at least in the near term. This would help to support real incomes in commodity-importing economies and lower headline consumer price inflation. An illustrative decline of 10% in global oil and gas prices could reduce global inflation by an average 0.3 percentage points per annum in the first two years, with the largest declines in more energy\u0002intensive non-OECD economies, and raise global output by around 0.1%. Combined with the other illustrative shocks, global inflation would be little changed overall, with global output falling by 1.1% by the second year of the shock. • The balance of these different shocks if they were to occur would have implications for macroeconomic policies. In the illustrative initial trade policy shock, policy interest rates are raised in the United States to help mitigate potential second-round effects on inflation, with rates rising relative to baseline by around ¾ percentage points on average in the first two years. The appreciation of the dollar exchange rate helps to raise import prices in other countries, with policy interest rates rising modestly in most in response. In the full combined shock, policy interest rates decline in all economies, reflecting the overall deflationary nature of these shocks. Fiscal pressures would increase as a result of the combined shocks, with weaker activity initially reducing tax revenue and higher unemployment adding to spending costs. After two years, government debt-to GDP ratios are raised by around 2 percentage points in the typical advanced economy. 34  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The impact of additional policy uncertainty could be even higher than shown in the illustrative scenario. Empirical estimates suggest that a one standard deviation shock to the economic policy uncertainty index is associated with a 1% cumulative decline in investment (see further discussion in Chapter 2). To put this in context, the economic policy uncertainty index for Canada rose by over 9 standard deviations between October 2024 and March 2025. Figure 1.18. Further trade cost increases and heightened uncertainty would harm growth Note: Simulated impact of an unanticipated increase of 10 percentage points in US tariffs on all non-commodity imports, a decline of 10% in equity prices in all countries, a rise of 50 basis points in global investment risk premia, a rise of 1 percentage point in household saving rates in all countries and a 10% decline in oil and natural gas prices. The tariff increases persist but the other shocks are assumed to fade gradually after two years. Source: OECD calculations using the NiGEM macroeconomic model. StatLink 2https://stat.link/y7updh Inflation could be more persistent An additional downside risk is that inflation remains stickier than otherwise anticipated. This could prompt more restrictive monetary policy, weakening growth prospects. Inflation remains above central bank targets in most OECD economies. In addition, the higher tariff rates imposed by the United States and China may result in higher-than-expected upward price adjustments for final goods in these economies, and higher costs that feed through to export prices. Any future effective exchange rate depreciation in other countries would also further raise import prices in these jurisdictions. As discussed above, another key risk is that tariff-induced price increases are accompanied by significant second round effects that cause further inflation persistence. Workers’ responding to lower purchasing power by pushing for higher nominal wages could raise costs for firms that may be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices. Attempts by companies to maintain their existing price-cost margins would also amplify the impact of the initial rise in import costs. Tight labour markets in many economies, combined with signs of rising consumer (Box 1.2) and corporate inflation expectations in some economies (Figure 1.12, Panel C), are factors that may elevate the probability of this risk occurring. Labour-intensive services sectors could experience particularly high inflation under such a scenario.  35 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Box 1.2. The distribution of household inflation expectations The distribution of inflation expectations provides information about the degree to which expectations are anchored to central bank inflation targets and how risks to inflation expectations are evolving through time. Recent moves upward in one-year ahead aggregate inflation expectations in the United States and Canada have been accompanied by a material increase in the proportion of respondents expecting inflation to exceed 4% in these economies. Around 48% of respondents in the United States in April 2025 expected inflation to be above that level, up from 35% in November 2024 (Figure 1.19, Panel A). In Canada, the proportion of respondents expecting inflation above 4% one-year ahead rose to 57% in the first quarter of 2025 from 44% in the fourth quarter of 2024 (Figure 1.19, Panel C). While there has also been an upward shift in the distribution of inflation expectations in some European economies, including Spain and the United Kingdom, this has not been the case in others, such as France, Italy, Germany and Belgium (Figure 1.19, Panel E and F). Figure 1.19. An increasing share of households in the United States and Canada are now expecting high inflation Note: In Panels E and F, “Latest” is March 2025 for all countries other than the United Kingdom (February 2025).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/e3hkrc 36  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 In comparison to the period immediately prior to the pandemic, the proportion of respondents in the United States and Canada expecting inflation to be at the inflation target has declined. This is also apparent when assessing the shifts in the distribution of expectations for inflation in the medium term (three-years ahead for the United States and two-years ahead for Canada; Figure 1.19, Panel B and D). There has also been a slight decline between late 2024 and early 2025 in the share of respondents expecting inflation to be at target. Corporate financial strains may prompt further risk repricing and spillovers across financial institutions Risk repricing in financial markets could be even more extensive in the event of downside surprises to economic growth or a resurgence of inflation. This would heighten market volatility and increase risks to financial stability. Despite recent moderation, asset valuations remain elevated in the United States and a few other markets (Figure 1.20, Panel A), and equity benchmarks remain highly concentrated (Figure 1.20, Panel B). Across both advanced and emerging economies, earnings expectations have continued to grow (Figure 1.21, Panel A), although some signs have begun to appear recently that suggest expected earnings may have plateaued in the United States. Potential risks to corporate earnings include a greater-than-expected impact of higher trade costs on profitability, as well as a more extensive economic slowdown than projected (Figure 1.21, Panel B). If there is a downward adjustment to earnings expectations, there could be sizeable further equity market corrections. Figure 1.20. Equity prices remain richly valued and many financial markets are increasingly concentrated Note: Panel A shows price-to-earnings ratios in selected G20 economies. Based on data up to 27 May 2025. The current price-to-earnings ratio (PER) is calculated by dividing the share price by the trailing 12-month earnings per share (June 2024 to May 2025) for companies listed in the benchmark. The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE) is calculated using 10-year average “cyclically-adjusted” earnings, expressed in April 2025 prices. A higher CAPE ratio compared to the PER indicates that stocks are richly valued. The concentration of equity benchmarks in Panel B is the share of the top 20 companies in the total market capitalisation of each equity benchmark for advanced and emerging-market economies.

These companies have been selected among the top 500 companies listed in selected equity benchmarks. For example, in the United States 28% of the companies with a correction were technology firms. Source: OECD calculations. Elevated levels of marketable and non-marketable corporate debt,3 with a large and growing share of non\u0002investment-grade bonds and leveraged loans,4 and high corporate refinancing needs in the near future pose risks to financial stability (OECD, 2024a; OECD, 2025a). The expected default risk premium for low\u0002rated corporates has risen markedly in North America, Europe, and Asia since mid-February, and despite recent moderation remains above levels observed prior to the announcement of higher tariffs in the United States. (Figure 1.22, Panel A). Concerns that banks could face higher non-performing loans were reflected in the decline in their price-to-book value ratios in April 2025 (Figure 1.22, Panel B) and higher expected default risk premia at large banks around the world. Weaker corporate financial conditions, combined with high uncertainty induced by additional tariffs in the world trading system, could also raise financing costs and deter fixed investment.5 3 Corporate debt (including both loans and bonds) in advanced economies declined to USD 54 trillion (94% of GDP) in 2024, down from a peak of USD 62 trillion (108% of GDP) in 2020. Corporate debt (broadly defined) in emerging economies remained elevated at USD 39 trillion (91% of GDP) in 2024, down from the record levels observed in 2020 (106% of GDP). Estimates are based on data on credit to the non-financial sector from the Bank for International Settlements. 4 The share of high-yield bond issuance in total bond issuance by non-financial corporates increased from 16% in 2009 to 22% in 2023, and the average share of leveraged loans in the total syndicated loans of non-financial corporates increased from an average 38% between 2000 and 2012 to 43% between 2013 and 2024. 5 The experience from the US-China 2018-19 trade tensions suggests that companies exposed to higher tariffs have lower investment, employment and productivity growth (Amiti et al, 2025; Chor and Li, 2021). 38  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.22.

The European and Japanese indices consist of the 125 and 40 most liquid investment-grade entities, respectively, traded in the CDS market.

The P/B ratio compares a bank’s current market capitalisation (i.e. its equity market value) to its accounting book value. A P/B ratio below 1.0 suggests that the market may be undervaluing the bank or that the bank may be slow in marking down impaired assets. Source: Bloomberg; and OECD calculations. A change in investors’ risk appetite could trigger widespread sell-offs of corporate bonds, especially by non-bank financial institutions. Given the low liquidity of high-yield corporate debt, even limited shocks can generate large price corrections, with significant risks of fire sales. Over half of investment-grade corporate bonds are just above the threshold for high-yield status.6If these bonds are downgraded, institutional investors bound by rating-based regulatory requirements will be obliged to sell them. Sales pressures during a downturn could also be exacerbated by pro-cyclical behaviour, especially given relatively high investor concentration in major corporate bond markets (Li and Yu, 2022; Boermans and Veumeulen, 2016), and by redemptions at investment funds. Real estate investment funds are particularly vulnerable to these effects, given the illiquid nature of their assets and the persistently uncertain outlook for the commercial real estate market. Real estate investment trusts experienced a marked decline in performance in April, with the industrial and retail sectors being hit hardest. The high price volatility of crypto-assets and the growing interconnectedness between non-bank financial intermediaries, banks and the crypto-asset market raise substantial risks to financial stability. The market capitalisation of crypto-assets has grown rapidly in recent years, reaching a historical peak of USD 3.7 trillion in mid-December 2024, up from USD 200 billion in January 2020. Subsequent sharp price falls until early April, partly reversed afterwards, suggest elevated valuations and a high sensitivity to repricing in other asset classes (IMF, 2025). The largest single component of the crypto-asset market is Bitcoin, which now represents over two-thirds of market capitalisation, supported by high inflows into Bitcoin exchange\u0002traded products. Crypto-assets often remain less regulated than traditional financial instruments, and data gaps hinder financial stability assessment (Aerts et al. 2025). A particular concern is that price corrections in crypto-assets and potential losses of retail and institutional investors and leveraged investment funds could spill over into other parts of the financial sector and the wider economy amidst forced deleveraging in response to market losses (OECD, 2022a). For instance, redemptions of stablecoins, often 6 At end-2023, 53% of all investment grade bond issuance by non-financial companies was rated BBB.  39 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 reserve-backed by short-term debt instruments, could under certain conditions trigger liquidity runs and pose significant disruption to short-term debt markets (OECD, 2022b). Market concentration and leverage may amplify shocks Higher volatility in equity prices amid concentrated markets remains a concern as there is a greater risk of idiosyncratic shocks spilling over and becoming systemic. The market value of equity and bond markets is often concentrated in a handful of individual stocks or bond issuers, raising the risk of large idiosyncratic sectoral or firm shocks spilling over and becoming systemic.7 A sudden price decline or rise in bond yields could also be amplified by forced asset sales by leveraged and illiquid investment funds, particularly since a small number of funds account for a large share of total corporate bond investment fund assets (OECD, 2025a).8 The growth of passive investment funds (which track the returns of established market benchmarks) may contribute to increased market concentration and stronger co-movements in stock prices, potentially amplifying the impact of negative shocks. Continued inflows into passive funds often disproportionately increase the market capitalisation of the largest companies in equity benchmarks, further concentrating equity markets and heightening their vulnerability to idiosyncratic risks (ECB, 2024). Passive investment funds managed about USD 15 trillion (51.6% of total fund assets) in 2024, up from USD 2 trillion (19.7%) in 2012 (Figure 1.23, Panel A).9 The rise in passive investing has also made the demand for individual stocks more inelastic, potentially leading to higher price volatility and lower liquidity (Haddad et al., 2021). As passive asset managers buy (sell) the whole basket of index constituents in response to fund inflows (outflows) and only adjust their portfolios in line with changes to the index composition, trading commonalities may increase among stocks, with stronger price co-movement. Greater price co-movement amid concentrated markets could threaten systemic stability by increasing the likelihood that many investors face losses simultaneously following firm or sector-specific shocks, triggering waves of redemptions from investment funds and synchronised sell\u0002offs (ESRB, 2019; Chinco and Sammon, 2024; ECB, 2024; OECD, 2025a). 7 Both current levels of concentration and developments over time in equity and corporate bond markets differ substantially across countries. 8 The world’s 100 largest corporate bond funds represent well over a third of global corporate bond assets. 9 Based on aggregate investment fund assets data from Bloomberg. In 2024, the passive share is 59% for equity funds and 38% for fixed income funds. 40  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.23. Global passive investing and use of derivatives by non-bank financial intermediaries have risen Note: Panel A displays total assets under management of investment funds (i.e. mutual and exchange traded funds) globally according to their active or passive investment strategies. Passive portfolio management is a strategy that tracks the returns of a market benchmark.

Panel B shows two proxies of leverage through the use of derivatives for non-bank financial intermediaries: the aggregate notional value of over-the-counter) derivative exposures and the ratio of notional amounts to gross market value of over-the-counter derivative exposures (FSB, 2023). Source: Bloomberg; Bank for International Settlements; Financial Stability Board; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/yugqzi The leveraged investment strategies and use of derivatives by some non-bank financial intermediaries could also amplify volatility (Figure 1.23, Panel B). The use of derivatives, particularly by speculative investment funds such as hedge funds, might enhance interconnectedness through complex intermediation chains. An unexpected rise in yields (or equity declines) can lead to rapid unwinding of leveraged trades, with forced selling in an illiquid market prompting further market weakness and margin calls (IOSCO, 2024; FSB, 2024). In early April 2025, following tariff announcements, hedge funds recorded the steepest margin calls since the onset of the pandemic.10 Interconnections between banks and non\u0002bank financial intermediaries could also lead to spillovers to the financial institutions that provide funding to investment funds when the latter face large outflows (OECD, 2024c; BIS, 2025). Financial market volatility also raises risks in emerging-market economies The risk of disruptive capital flows has risen in emerging-market economies. Between October 2024 and January 2025, capital flowed out of emerging-market economies (Figure 1.24, Panel A), partly driven by the relative strength of the US economy. However, this reversed in February and March as fears of a slowdown in the United States rose and the spread between emerging-market and US bond yields widened (Figure 1.24, Panel B). In most emerging-market economies, bilateral US dollar exchange rates have appreciated in 2025, especially since April, with a strong rise in the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso and the Taiwanese dollar, as investors reduced their exposure to US assets. Capital flows are likely to remain volatile as risks of sharp asset repricing and high uncertainty persist. For some emerging market economies, large and sudden capital inflows can lead to strong appreciation and may prove challenging 10 Although volatility in equity and bond markets and trading volumes has been exceptionally high amid forced cash raising, market functioning has remained orderly (BoE, 2025).  41 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 to manage. However, many emerging market economies are at risk of experiencing capital outflows if relative economic prospects and global risk sentiment deteriorate, which could lead to depreciation pressures and higher financing costs. Many emerging-market economies remain vulnerable to debt distress. Sovereign debt levels and borrowing costs have risen significantly in recent years. Government debt as a share of GDP is now higher than in 2019 in almost three quarters of emerging and developing economies (World Bank, 2025). In these circumstances, borrowing is likely to become more challenging. Around 40% of total outstanding high-risk government bonds at the end of 2024 will mature in 2025 and 2026 (Figure 1.25, Panel A), and approximately 20% of all bonds have been issued before 2021, when interest rates were lower (OECD, 2025a). Larger countries and those with a higher credit rating have more developed local bond markets and broader access to finance. In contrast, lower income and high-risk countries rely more on foreign currency borrowing and are susceptible to changes in exchange rates and in risk sentiment. Although low-income countries have less direct exposure to trade with the United States than middle-income countries (Figure 1.25, Panel B), half remain at high risk of distress or are in distress, as many advanced countries have recently reduced foreign aid.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/w9m1kh There are several possible sources of positive surprises There are also various upside risks to the forecasts that would push economic growth higher if they were to occur. The baseline scenario assumes that the recent increases in bilateral tariff rates remain in place throughout 2025 and 2026 in all countries. A reversal of these restrictions, or steps towards a broader agreement to lower tariff barriers from current levels, would boost growth and reduce inflation relative to the baseline (see Figure 1.36 below). Additional structural reforms that lower the economic costs of regulation could also promote stronger growth. In the United States, initiatives are underway to lighten the regulatory burden by eliminating measures that create significant costs for businesses and households without effectively addressing market failures. Agency heads are currently reviewing all regulations under their jurisdiction to identify those that should be rescinded (The White House, 2025). Faced with higher trade barriers, other countries may also be prompted to undertake growth-enhancing structural reforms that promote international competitiveness. New OECD analysis highlights that regulatory reforms in network sectors could produce significant economy-wide gains: if network sector regulations in more regulated countries converged to those in the least-regulated countries, economy-wide labour productivity could rise by 1.7% (Andrews et al., 2025). Similarly, further efforts to harmonise regulations across countries, including within the European Union, or between subnational jurisdictions, such as in Canada or Australia, could support stronger trade and productivity growth. A peaceful resolution of conflicts in Europe and the Middle East could also reduce geopolitical uncertainty and improve confidence, providing a tailwind for spending and investment. Additional public defence spending could also have positive implications for growth, though this is not necessarily the case if financed by cutting other forms of government spending. There may also be an upside risk from the prospect of further declines in oil prices. Global oil supply is expected to outpace demand in the near term, owing both to weaker global demand growth and strong anticipated increases in oil production in several non-OPEC countries including the United States and Canada (IEA, 2025).  43 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Policies Tariff increases complicate monetary policy decisions Policy interest rates have declined further in most advanced economies in recent months, with the notable exception of Japan, where policy accommodation continues to be gradually withdrawn. Central bank balance sheet reductions have also continued, though the United States has slowed down quantitative tightening and Canada has announced plans to bring it to an end. The monetary policy stance remains restrictive in most countries, with forward-looking long-term real interest rates well above pre-pandemic norms and having edged up slightly in recent months, especially in Europe (Figure 1.26, Panel B). In contrast, short-term real rates have fallen, particularly in the United States (Figure 1.26, Panel A) due to an increase in one-year ahead inflation expectations. Figure 1.26. Long-term real interest rates remain high but short-term real rates have declined Note: Based on data up to 27 May 2025. In Panel A, the real short-term interest rates are calculated using nominal one-year government bond yields and one year-ahead inflation expectations by consumers in the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom, and by corporates participating in the Tankan Survey in Japan. In Panel B, the real long-term interest rates show 10-year inflation-linked bond yields. Source: Bank of England; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; Bank of Japan; European Central Bank; University of Michigan; and OECD calculations. Faced with heightened uncertainty and the likelihood that tariff increases will raise goods price inflation, central banks will need to remain vigilant to ensure that underlying inflation pressures are durably contained. A one-off rise in the relative price of tradeable goods is likely to be accommodated. However, a sequence of such changes, or signs that inflation expectations are rising and rekindling wage pressures in still-tight labour markets, would likely require higher policy rates than would otherwise be the case. Set against this, any associated decline in output would place some general downward pressure on inflation. The balance of these pressures may differ across countries. The downside effects of higher uncertainty and weaker exports are likely to be the main factors in many countries exporting to the United States, but countries raising tariffs will face pressures from sizeable price increases as well as those from softer growth. Provided trade tensions do not intensify further and inflation expectations remain anchored, policy rate reductions can continue in economies where inflation is projected to moderate. Further moderation in nominal wage growth and continued progress in disinflation in services sectors will be critical factors that enable monetary policy easing to proceed smoothly. Under the projected outlook for inflation and GDP growth, policy rate reductions are expected to continue during 2025 and in some cases 2026 in all the major advanced economies other than Japan (Figure 1.27). 44  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 • In the United States, the federal funds rate is projected to remain unchanged through 2025, with rates then being lowered to 3¼-3½% by the end of 2026. Bond holdings are projected to decline further throughout 2025-26, albeit at a slower pace reflecting the lower monthly redemption cap for Treasury securities from April 2025. • In the euro area, policy rate reductions are projected to continue this year, bringing the deposit facility rate to 1¾% by the third quarter of 2025. The decline in Eurosystem bond holdings is expected to continue broadly at the pace observed since early 2025, with no reinvestment of redemptions under either the asset purchase programme or the pandemic emergency purchase programme. • In Japan, the policy rate is projected to increase gradually to 1¼% by the end of 2026, as core inflation stabilises around 2% and a negative output gap gradually closes. The government bond holdings of the Bank of Japan are expected to decline, as the bank’s monthly purchases are reduced by about JPY 400 billion per quarter. Bank of Japan outstanding assets under the loan support programme are also expected to decrease, as new disbursements to stimulate bank lending are scheduled to end in June 2025, and no rollover is to be made after the beginning of 2026. • Reductions in policy rates are projected to continue until the second half of 2025 in Canada and Korea, and until the first half of 2026 in Australia and the United Kingdom. Central bank bond holdings are assumed to decline further in Australia and the United Kingdom. In contrast, renewed asset purchases through term repos followed by outright purchases of treasury bills are expected in Canada, allowing the balance sheet size to eventually stabilise as a share of GDP.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/kbwrnf By the end of 2026, real policy rates are generally projected to be within estimated ranges for real neutral rates (Figure 1.28, Panel A) – the real interest rate at which the policy stance is neither accommodative nor restrictive. Inflation is generally projected to be back or close to target at that time, and growing geopolitical fragmentation increases the odds that it eventually settles at target, rather than dropping below it, as in most of the decade following the global financial crisis. This would lead to sustained higher nominal policy rates than before the pandemic, increasing the room for monetary policy manoeuvre through conventional tools in the event of future downturns. Greater room for manoeuvre could also follow if the future neutral rate was to be higher than what current estimates suggest, for instance due to reforms to  45 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 strengthen productivity and investment, or a larger supply of public debt, to which pressures on public spending (discussed below) and quantitative tightening would contribute (Schnabel, 2025). There is some tentative evidence of a mild rise in neutral rate estimates in major jurisdictions over the past few years (Figure 1.28, Panel B). Figure 1.28. Real policy rates are projected to converge towards neutral levels Note: In Panel A, the projected real policy rate in 2026Q4 is calculated using the nominal policy rate deflated by annual core inflation over the year to 2026Q4 (except for India and Indonesia, where headline inflation is used).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/4ditfp Larger debt burdens will bring forward important fiscal policy choices The fiscal projections for 2025-26 are conditional on announced government measures and OECD assessments of current plans (Annex 1.A). Underlying primary balances are expected to worsen, relative to potential GDP, in several advanced OECD economies in 2025. Improvements are projected the following year, yet only a couple of countries are planning substantial fiscal consolidation in 2026. The projected median change in underlying primary balances over the next two years is approximately zero. • In the United States, the structural deficit will remain large with underlying primary spending exceeding revenues by 3.4% of GDP in 2026, and the aggregate general government budget deficit exceeding 8% of GDP. Higher tariff receipts will only partly offset revenues lost due to the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, new tax reductions and weaker economic growth. Efficiency 46  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 measures, including shrinking the federal government workforce, will help slow growth in public expenditure; however, additional spending will reduce net budget savings. • The euro area’s underlying primary deficit is estimated to shrink by 0.3% of GDP between 2024 and 2026. Modest fiscal consolidation will occur this year, associated with the phase-out of energy crisis support, with little change in the fiscal stance projected for 2026. While high-debt countries including France and Italy are planning budget repair, other economies including Germany are expected to have a fiscal expansion in 2026, with increased spending to upgrade infrastructure and military capability (Box 1.3). • Japan’s underlying primary deficit is projected to narrow by 0.9% of potential GDP in the two years to 2026. The projection assumes no supplementary budgets are passed in financial years 2025 and 2026. A corporate tax rate increase in 2026 will help finance new spending. The government is planning to increase outlays on disaster preparedness in addition to expenditure on defence and support for families with children. • Substantial fiscal policy tightening of 1% of potential GDP or more is projected over 2025-26 in Iceland, Israel, Korea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. In contrast, fiscal expansions are projected in Denmark (2.8% of GDP), Norway (0.6% of GDP) and Sweden (0.3% of GDP) with all three Nordic countries raising defence spending. Australia’s underlying primary deficit is expected to expand in the next two years, but little change is projected in Canada. Figure 1.29. Public debt determinants in OECD countries Note: Median values are shown in each year for advanced OECD economies. Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/rxcf0i Near-term budget pressures from debt service costs and military spending will be compounded in the long run by persisting costs associated with climate mitigation and adaptation and population ageing. Sizeable primary deficits, elevated interest payments and lower growth (Figure 1.29) will keep public debt ratios high and rising in many OECD economies over 2025-26. For the group of OECD countries, the ratio of gross general government debt to GDP is projected to increase by 2.3 percentage points over the two years to the fourth quarter of 2026 (to 114% of GDP). Increases of 1.5 percentage points in the euro area and 5.9 percentage points in the United States are projected, while Japan’s gross public debt ratio is forecast to decline. Where growth is strong enough to withstand additional fiscal headwinds, consolidation efforts should intensify in high-debt countries as monetary policy becomes less restrictive. Other advanced economies have the fiscal room for manoeuvre to increase public spending for some years while running down surpluses or borrowing to finance larger deficits. Amid heightened geopolitical tensions, many countries are fast-tracking defence investments to bolster national security (Box 1.3). Such spending will  47 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 add to debt burdens in some countries in the second half of this decade. In contrast, some heavily indebted countries – including France, Italy and the United Kingdom – are pressing ahead with budget repair to avoid the risk of abrupt and painful fiscal corrections later (Figure 1.30). In the near term, governments may also face new calls for additional support in countries confronted with higher trade costs. A first line of defence is to allow automatic stabilisers to operate fully. Targeted, temporary and well-designed support measures (Hemmerlé et al., 2023) could, if necessary, help cushion the initial impact of liquidity shocks felt by companies. Protracted budgetary support to firms facing a lasting loss of external competitiveness should be avoided. Figure 1.30.

Higher defence spending: economic and public finance implications Defence spending has increased recently in many OECD countries after declining in the three decades following the end of the Cold War. This is evident in Europe, where military expenditure has outpaced growth in GDP since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and also in Israel. Relative to the size of their economies, EU countries in Central and Eastern Europe have invested particularly heavily in their armed forces (Figure 1.31). Poland and the Baltic states have set ambitious goals for future spending, pledging to lift military expenditure to 5% of GDP in years to come. High targets for defence spending, often well above recent outlays, have also been declared in Czechia and the Nordic countries as well as in France and the United Kingdom (Figure 1.32, Panel A). In Germany, where defence spending increased from relatively low levels a few years ago to reach 1.9% of GDP in 2024, constitutional hurdles to higher spending have been removed (see below). While legislated measures leave major spending challenges to future governments in some countries, ongoing defence expenditure is trending higher, in Europe and also in several Asian OECD countries, notably Japan. In contrast, the United States does not have long-term plans to raise the GDP share of its military spending, which is already higher than in most other OECD countries. Few countries have released detailed information about their medium-term defence spending plans. However, major investments in equipment and infrastructure are considered necessary in many countries to address capability gaps. For instance, European Commission estimates suggest such investments by EU member states could be worth a total of EUR 500 billion over the next decade (1.1% of 2024 GDP). 1 48  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 While defence investment has increased more rapidly than total defence spending in recent years, personnel costs – a major component of government consumption – typically still make up a larger share of OECD countries’ total defence budgets (39% on average in 2023, compared with 24% for investment).2 Higher defence spending will add to budgetary pressures in many economies. In some, consolidation of other government outlays is expected to create room for higher defence expenditure. This is reflected in budget plans in Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Poland and the United Kingdom. Most of these countries also project budget support from higher revenues. However, few OECD countries have managed to finance large increases in defence outlays in recent years without running down fiscal surpluses or increasing budget deficits. This aligns with historical experience, as substantial additional government borrowing often accompanies the first phases of military build-ups before countries raise taxes (Marzian and Trebesch, 2025). Over the next two years, budget positions are expected to deteriorate in many countries planning higher public spending on defence. Figure 1.31.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/lk7t1x Fiscal rules are changing to accommodate higher defence spending. In Germany, constitutional reform has lifted constraints on borrowing for defence spending ahead of major investments over the coming years. Sweden has departed from a longstanding target of a budget surplus to shift to a balanced budget rule from 2027, enabling higher military expenditure. In parallel to national reforms, the European Commission has invited EU member states able to withstand additional fiscal pressure without threatening debt sustainability to make use of national escape clauses in the Stability and Growth Pact (European Commission, 2025a). Recognising Europe’s “extraordinary” security challenge, national escape clauses – once activated by the Council – would allow deviations from medium-term budget plans of up to 1.5% of GDP over the next four years, with increased spending to go only on defence.3As at the end of April, 16 member states had decided to request the activation of the national escape clause. 4 In countries with limited fiscal space, financial market pressure may curb defence-spending ambitions, even if escape clauses are activated and EU loans help fund defence investments.5 This constraint may be relevant for countries already under the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure, a group that includes France,  49 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Poland and Italy, respectively the Union’s second, third and fourth biggest defence spenders in absolute terms based on data published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI, 2025). Sustaining higher military expenditure for a long period of time, or even permanently, could force higher\u0002debt countries to confront hard policy trade-offs. While increased borrowing may enable governments to finance large military investments during a transition period, countries unable to sufficiently curb growth in non-military spending may ultimately have to consider raising tax burdens further (Figure 1.32, Panel B). A challenge in monitoring the use of escape clauses will be to ensure that other types of spending, for instance non-military foreign aid, are not reclassified as defence expenditure to circumvent fiscal rules. Gains to actual or potential growth could help offset the fiscal costs of defence spending but are uncertain and will vary from country to country. In the near term, higher government final expenditure on defence will contribute to demand, employment and incomes, especially if it is financed by borrowing. Some studies suggest fiscal multipliers from military expenditure could be relatively high in advanced economies, with little or no crowding out of private demand in some circumstances (Sheremirov and Spirovska, 2022). Larger near-term output effects are more likely in low-debt countries; when monetary policy accommodates higher government spending; and in countries with established local defence industries (such as France, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom). Recent analyses of the possible economic impact of higher military expenditure in Europe have produced estimates ranging from a 0.5 to 1.5% boost to Europe-wide GDP for defence spending increases of 1.5% of GDP (Ilzetzki, 2025; European Commission, 2025b), with potentially larger effects for economies in recession and if monetary policy responses are limited (Ilzetzki, 2025). In some countries, such as Germany, there are possibilities for automotive manufacturers to produce defence equipment or for defence producers to repurpose factories, buy equipment or hire workers let go by ailing car producers. However, many countries contemplating higher military spending, including some EU member states, have few or no major local producers of military equipment. In the last four years, 64% of arms imports by European NATO states came from the United States (SIPRI, 2025). The net output effects of defence spending might also differ by type of spending.6 Defence infrastructure projects (for instance, building airfields, docks or storage facilities) or spending on equipment might be associated with relatively high multipliers if, in addition to increased public sector investment, they generate domestic private sector activity and jobs, and rely mainly on locally-sourced materials. Government spending on the armed forces (for instance, additions to military personnel) also contributes to domestic output – directly through public consumption and indirectly via household consumption – and is likely to have larger net effects in economies below full employment.7 Efficient procurement will be essential to support realised improvements in military capability and may help foster innovation spillovers. In Europe, coordinated purchasing between countries should be pursued alongside steps to improve competition and reduce fragmentation in the defence market (Wolff et al., 2025). To the extent that European countries are able to source defence equipment, inputs or services from each other, and stretched availability of supplies does not raise costs, regional multipliers from defence spending could exceed those in individual European countries. Provided inflationary effects are small, positive output effects could be larger, and distributed more broadly across countries, if closely connected economies simultaneously expand their defence spending. Efficient joint procurement could also enhance long-run cross-border spillovers from investment in defence research and development.8 Historical experience suggests increased defence R&D could support higher private sector productivity (Ilzetzki, 2025), provided increased employment of skilled workers in defence does not exacerbate skills shortages in other industries. Should military spending reallocate labour and capital to less efficient uses, aggregate productivity could be lower (OECD, 2025c). 50  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.32. Ambitious military spending goals could force tough fiscal policy choices Note: Goals refer to announced defence spending objectives, whether or not backed by concrete plans, timeframes or legislated measures. Where the goal is expressed as a range (for example, 5-6% of GDP), the bottom of the range is shown. For Germany, newly passed reforms exclude military spending above 1% of GDP from the calculation of the country's debt limit. In the coming years, German defence spending is expected to rise above the current 2% of GDP commitment, but the new government’s full plans are not yet available. Tax revenue data are for 2023.

Relatively few studies of multipliers examine the effects of different types of government spending. Findings are mixed among empirical studies comparing multipliers for government investment and consumption. For example, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012) find near-term output effects of US government investment (a multiplier over 2) that are higher than those for US government consumption (roughly 0.5). Boehm (2020), in a study of OECD countries, finds the opposite holds for short-lived investment spending shocks (ones substantially dissipating within two years) - government investment multipliers are found to be near zero, reflecting lower private investment, while government consumption multipliers are higher (around 0.8). The US study of Haug and Sznajderska (2024) finds that multipliers for government consumption and investment are not statistically significantly different (and around 0.5). 7. A recent study of Central and Eastern European countries finds relatively high multipliers on military personnel expenditures (exceeding unity two years after a spending shock), which is argued to reflect private consumption by military staff (Olejnik, 2023). As in some other papers, multipliers for military expenditures are found to be higher in recessions. 8. Steinwender, Van Reenen and Moretti (2019) study spillovers from defence to private sector R&D within and across countries. With debt burdens already high in many countries, a step-up in fiscal pressure brings forward hard policy choices. Many of the costs of maintaining larger armed forces, mitigating climate change, adapting to warmer climates, and supporting older populations will coincide and persist for some time. These  51 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 pressures will exacerbate structural budget imbalances that already exist. To keep public debt sustainable, and preserve buffers to respond to future shocks, countries should pursue fiscal reforms alongside other priorities. Many advanced economies are looking to curb public expenditure, with reductions in public investment, green infrastructure financing, foreign aid, basic research or cuts to government employment often treated as potential sources of savings. While improving the budget balance in the short run, measures of this sort may erode public service capacity, withdraw support from those most in need and set back long-term objectives, including the need for strong economic growth amid a transition to net zero emissions. Systematic and regular spending reviews and the adoption of new digital technologies could help to improve public sector efficiency while preserving essential public programmes, and limit harm to potential growth by reallocating resources efficiently as priorities shift. Effective targeting of social benefits and pension systems that encourage longer working lives could also help to contain spending (OECD, 2024b; OECD, 2024c). Countries differ markedly in the resources they devote to old age and other social protection expenditure (Figure 1.33), differences that are only partly explained by relative incomes and demographics (Barnes et al., 2025). Many recently announced and ongoing tax reforms – including measures to broaden consumption tax bases by reducing distortive tax expenditures (Iceland), raise taxation of carbon emissions (Ireland, Portugal) and improve tax collection (Bulgaria, Greece) – could, if carried forward, strengthen structural budget positions while limiting costs to sustainable growth. Other current revenue raising measures, including tariff increases in the United States and direct tax measures in the United Kingdom could, however, be partially offset by adverse impacts on activity. Revenue-raising reforms should generally aim to shift tax systems over time towards less-distortive taxes with fewer exemptions, as it is difficult to alleviate debt burdens without strong economic growth (Pina et al., 2025). There is scope in several advanced economies to raise proportionally more revenue from consumption, environmental and property taxes while relying less heavily on taxing wages (OECD, 2024b; OECD, 2024c). Medium-term planning is essential to preserve or free up resources for strategically important projects, many of which will weigh on the public finances. Such plans can help avoid excessive debt accumulation and reduce uncertainty about the conduct of fiscal policy. Fiscal rules remain important for the sound management of public finances, even if subject to deviations through escape clauses or other flexibility mechanisms – for instance, to support productive investment or higher defence spending (Box 1.3). Independent fiscal institutions can also play a useful role in assessing the impact of proposed policy changes, overseeing countries’ return to quantitative budget limits, and communicating the need to keep justified departures temporary. 52  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.33.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/o0hzwi Emerging-market economies should strive to reduce inflation and fiscal deficits Policy rate reductions have continued across many emerging-market economies in recent quarters and have started in India, where inflation pressures have gradually abated, creating greater scope for supporting the economy. However, rate reductions have slowed down or been halted since early 2025 in several countries, especially in Latin America, partly due to the persistence of inflation pressures or exchange rate developments. Amid strong growth and rising inflation in Brazil, the policy rate has been raised four times since December 2024 over concerns about a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. In Türkiye, after three consecutive policy rate reductions since December 2024, the policy rate was raised again in April to lower risks of a renewed rise in inflation pressures. Given low inflation, key policy interest rates and reserve requirements have been lowered further in China. Scope still exists to lower policy rates in most emerging-market economies over the next 18 months, but policy decisions are likely to remain finely balanced. While the projected slowdown of global trade will tend to weaken economic activity, higher tariffs imposed by some countries are likely to put some upward pressure on producer costs worldwide, and higher policy uncertainty may heighten risk aversion in financial markets. Careful calibration of monetary policy will be essential to keep inflation expectations well anchored and to avoid disruptive capital outflows. If necessary, rate reductions may need to be slowed, or even reversed temporarily, to ensure price stability. The expected pace of policy rate reductions is projected to vary across countries (Figure 1.34): • China is expected to maintain an accommodative monetary stance to support activity as inflation is likely to remain low, despite some upward pressures from the additional tariffs on trade with the United States.  53 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 • In Colombia and Mexico, where policy rates remain elevated, reductions are expected to continue steadily until late 2026, with rates being lowered to 7% and 6.25%, respectively, still somewhat above or close to the upper bound of neutral level estimates. Further small rate reductions are also expected in Chile. • In India, policy rate reductions are expected to cease by end-2025, while in Indonesia modest rate reductions are projected to continue until late 2026, with inflation projected to return to target and policy rates to broadly neutral levels. The policy rate is already close to neutral level estimates in South Africa where rate reductions are expected to cease by end-2025. • In Türkiye, where inflation is projected to decline to around 15% by the end of 2026, policy rate reductions are expected to resume over 2025 and 2026. • In Brazil, given persistent inflation pressures, policy rates are projected to increase further in the coming months to 15%, before a gradual reduction starting from early 2026.

In 2024, fiscal deficits were recorded in most emerging-market economies and rose in many of them (Figure 1.35, Panel A). The expansion of fiscal support in China and the new nationwide free school meal programme in Indonesia weighed on budget balances. In Colombia, the fiscal deficit increased as tax revenue falls outpaced spending cuts, and in Mexico as oil revenues fell. Fiscal balances also worsened in Bulgaria and Romania, due to continued spending pressures in social expenditure and public sector wages. In contrast, the Brazilian fiscal balance improved in 2024, partly due to one-off revenue measures. Budget balances also improved in India and South Africa. 54  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Based on announced policy plans, fiscal balances are projected to improve in most emerging-market economies in 2025-26 despite slowing growth. Türkiye is expected to continue consolidating as higher consumption taxes increase revenue and public investment is reduced further. Fiscal deficits in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru are projected to narrow as governments restrain spending and boost tax revenues, although they are projected to fall short of their fiscal targets in Colombia and Peru. India is also expected to consolidate further, partly by streamlining subsidies. In contrast, the fiscal deficit in Brazil is projected to persist in 2025, as there is limited political appetite for raising additional tax revenue, and to worsen in 2026 as growth slows. Fiscal balances are generally expected to improve in most countries in 2026, but the pace of improvement is projected to be relatively modest (Figure 1.35, Panels B and C). Emerging-market economies face a challenging environment. Amid rising debt and interest payments, they remain vulnerable to rapid shifts in risk sentiment and higher borrowing costs. They need to adjust to the changing global trade environment while preserving investor confidence and avoiding disorderly capital outflows. Countries should strive to meet fiscal consolidation targets, while ensuring that any support to help the economy adjust to changes in trade arrangements is targeted and temporary. In the medium to long-term, countries will need to reconcile fiscal sustainability with higher investment in human and physical capital, including for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and with steps to reinforce social safety nets. Addressing these trade-offs will require fiscal-structural reforms, such as enhancing spending efficiency, including by reducing untargeted subsidies, and improving revenue collection through curbing informality and broadening tax bases. Furthermore, strengthening fiscal institutions, such as fiscal rules and fiscal councils, might also lower financing costs and improve credibility (Alnafrah and Bogatov, 2025; Caldera Sanchez et al., 2024).

Fiscal balances are expected to improve in most emerging-market economies Annual change in the ratio of the headline fiscal balance to GDP and in the output gap Note: The chart is based on central government financial balances for Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and Thailand, and general government financial balances for all other countries apart from Mexico, where the overall public balance is used (comprising federal and other public agencies such as the social security system and state-owned enterprises).

Countries should also not lose sight of the opportunities for potential benefits from collectively agreeing to lower the current tariff and non-tariff barriers on goods and services. In an illustrative scenario in which all countries act to lower their average effective tariff rates by 1½ percentage points (relative to those assumed in the baseline projections), global output would be raised by close to 0.3% by the third year and global inflation reduced by close to ¼ percentage point on average in the first three years (Figure 1.36; OECD, 2025b).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/ci0d7h Efforts to prevent further trade fragmentation should be coupled with reforms that strengthen the resilience of supply chains, including by encouraging firms to diversify both suppliers and buyers. Diversification would be aided by aligned regulatory standards on key intermediate production inputs between countries. This includes ongoing efforts to harmonise regulations between countries in the European Union. There is also additional scope to better align regulatory standards between sub-national jurisdictions. For example, in Canada, further eliminating differences in product and labour regulations and technical standards between provinces would better allow goods and services to flow to where they are most needed. Reforming trade facilitation procedures could also reduce trade costs and support greater diversification and depth in trade. Many countries have recently improved such procedures, by enhancing cooperation between border agencies both domestically and across countries. OECD estimates suggest that trade costs have declined by up to 5% over the last decade due to improvements in the efficiency of border processes, with the strongest effects in lower-income and lower middle-income economies (OECD 2025d; Figure 1.37). Further ambitious reforms to border agency co-operation, efforts to enhance the implementation of regulatory frameworks for trade facilitation, and to automate and simplify procedures could reduce delays and compliance costs and improve supply chain efficiency, potentially reducing trade costs by up to a further 12 percentage points (OECD, 2025d). Such improvements would help to boost the ability of exporters to find new markets and deepen existing trade relationships. 56  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.37.

Source: OECD (2025d). StatLink 2https://stat.link/rdza3c Lower barriers to trade in services would also promote trade flows. The OECD Services Trade Restrictiveness Index highlights the continued challenges of regulatory fragmentation and uneven conditions in access to services markets across countries (Figure 1.38, Panel A). This creates an uneven playing field which hampers trade in services as well as goods, because many services, such as logistics, are also crucial for global trade in goods. The pace and magnitude of services sector reforms were moderate in 2024 compared to 2023, with higher restrictions in all 22 services sectors and meaningful trade liberalisation in only a handful of sectors (OECD, 2025e). Ambitious policy reforms reducing services trade restrictiveness, equivalent to closing half the distance between current and best practice, could result in trade costs falling by around 11% in services sectors (OECD, 2024d; Figure 1.38, Panel B), with additional productivity benefits for manufacturers using services. This would be a significant potential offset to higher tariffs. Further efforts to support the digital delivery of services could also yield benefits. Raising digital connectivity between countries can support trade in goods as well as in services. However, digital services policy remains fragmented and increasingly restrictive. The OECD Digital Services Trade Restrictiveness Index shows that rising trade restrictions on digitally enabled services between 2014 and 2023 particularly affected access to communication infrastructure and connectivity (OECD, 2025e). Governments need to find an appropriate balance between safeguards and ensuring adequate competition in digital services. Trade tends to rise fastest when policies to lower trade facilitation costs are undertaken alongside significant improvements in the digital regulatory framework, highlighting the importance of carefully designed reforms to maximise the benefits for trade performance and competitiveness.  57 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.38.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/3axqg6 Rising protectionism and weak growth prospects also reinforce the need for governments to promote productivity and improve living standards through undertaking ambitious structural policy reforms. As discussed in Chapter 2, a strong focus should be policies to promote business investment that supports innovation and stronger growth in labour productivity. Investment prospects are now being damaged by the significant rise in policy uncertainty and this follows a marked slowdown in the pace of business investment in many economies since the financial crisis (Figure 1.39, Panel A). Only a small portion of this investment slowdown can be explained by weaker demand growth. Firms across OECD economies have increasingly invested in digital assets (Figure 1.39, Panel B), but the impact on net investment rates has been more than offset by weaker growth in traditional forms of capital investment and higher depreciation. Housing and public investment have also slowed in many countries, contributing to deteriorating housing affordability and public infrastructure. 58  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.39. Business investment gaps are large across OECD economies Note: In Panel A, the investment gap is calculated as the shortfall relative to predicted investment from a simple accelerator model that relates real business investment growth to its own lag and to current real output growth. Predicted real business investment is calculated from 2008 to 2023 as the fitted values from a model using actual growth rates of GDP and lagged investment. The overall shortfall in real business investment relative to the pre-GFC trend in 2023 is then decomposed into a part that is explained by the model, interpreted as demand (calculated as trend investment minus predicted investment) and an unexplained part, or “gap” (calculated as predicted investment minus actual investment, as a per cent of predicted investment). In Panel B, ICT machinery includes both computer hardware and telecommunications equipment. ‘Other’ includes Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/0b6hm1 Weakening business investment has reflected structural factors in many economies. Despite rising profits, firms have shied away from fixed capital investment in favour of accumulating financial assets and returning funds to shareholders (OECD, 2025a). Across the OECD, the corporate sector has moved from being a net borrower to a net lender on aggregate since the financial crisis. This has coincided with an increase in required rates of return on investment, with the gap between the hurdle rates that businesses apply to investment decisions and capital costs having widened across countries (Figure 1.40). Identifying the factors behind sticky hurdle rates is fundamental for policymakers aiming to revive business investment growth. Elevated uncertainty, declining business dynamism and perceived difficulties in funding future investment in intangible assets are all factors that have been identified as playing a role in OECD economies (see Chapter 2). Against this backdrop, there are a range of structural policy reforms that can help revive business investment growth (see Chapters 2 and 3). Efforts to assuage policy uncertainty are key, as they would allow businesses to reduce the risk-premia they incorporate in hurdle rates. This is relevant across various policy dimensions, with specific approaches including conducting trade policy through a transparent and rules-based approach, outlining and implementing credible fiscal strategies, reducing complexity and improving transparency in regulatory policies and taking further credible steps to mitigate and adapt to climate change.  59 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.40.

Source: Gormsen and Huber (2023). StatLink 2https://stat.link/0tifmy Policies that promote business dynamism would also incentivise firms to innovate and invest as they strive to stay ahead of competitors. In many nascent industries, such as artificial intelligence, measures are often needed to lower barriers to firm entry and guard against firms building monopolistic positions. Given signs of reduced business dynamism in OECD economies (Calligaris, et. al. 2024), efforts to reduce the costs of regulations to businesses are needed. For example, there is significant scope to lower barriers to firm entry in capital-intensive network sectors, with new OECD simulations suggesting that deregulation in more highly regulated economies towards the regulatory levels of their least regulated peers is associated with an increase in the potential capital stock of up to 1.5% (Andrews et. al. 2025). Many countries also still lack adequate rules guaranteeing the transparency and accountability of lobbying activities. This regulatory void can benefit incumbents and well-funded corporations, enabling them to shape rules and the implementation of these rules in their favour at the expense of new entrants. Less punishing insolvency regimes and less prescriptive land use regulations are other key policy areas for promoting business dynamism, through their influence in supporting entrepreneurship and the growth of new businesses. Ensuring the availability of skilled labour will also be important for the expansion of high potential firms, both through a focus on lifelong learning policies and structural reforms that lower frictions in labour markets, such as reducing the prevalence of unnecessary non-compete clauses. Measures that facilitate better access to finance, especially for funding hard-to-collateralise intangible assets, can promote current investment spending by reducing the need for firms to save for future intangible investment spending. Improved depth of capital markets would support a more diverse range of funding options and promote competition between lenders. In Europe, making further progress on implementing the Savings and Investments Union will be important in this regard. Developing certain segments of capital markets that are more well-suited to funding intangibles than traditional banking systems may require some public financial support as well as regulatory changes. While remaining attuned to potential implications for financial stability, examples include adjusting regulatory restrictions on the investment activities of pension providers, public investment in venture capital markets and reducing administrative requirements on fintech lenders. 60  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 References Aerts, S., A.

Policy and other assumptions underlying the projections Fiscal policy settings for 2025-26 are based as closely as possible on legislated tax and spending provisions and are consistent with the growth, inflation and wage projections. Where government plans have been announced but not legislated, they are incorporated if it is deemed clear that they will be implemented in a shape close to that announced. It is assumed that EU countries generally adopt fiscal policy adjustments which are consistent with the reformed Stability and Growth Pact, apart from those member states where planned fiscal expansions are likely to require the activation of national escape clauses. Projections for the EU countries account for spending financed by the NextGenerationEU (NGEU) grants and loans, based on expert judgments about the distribution of spending across years and different expenditure categories and informed by officially announced plans where available. NGEU grants are assumed to be budget neutral, and increase both capital tax and transfers receipts and government expenditure. In addition, positive net one-offs are added in order to reflect the discretionary stimulus associated with those grants, as measured by changes in underlying primary balances. For monetary policy, the assumed path of policy interest rates and unconventional measures represents the most likely outcome, conditional upon the OECD projections of activity and inflation. This may differ from the stated path of the monetary authorities. In the euro area, 10-year sovereign spreads relative to Germany are assumed to remain constant over the projection period at levels close to those observed in the first half of May. The projections assume unchanged exchange rates from those prevailing on 9 May 2025: one US dollar equals JPY 145.2, EUR 0.89 (or equivalently one euro equals USD 1.13) and 7.24 renminbi. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is assumed to remain constant at USD 60 until the end of 2026. The TTF natural gas price is assumed to remain constant at EUR 35 MW/h until the end of 2026. Other commodity prices are assumed to be constant over the projection period at their average levels from April 2025. A technical assumption is made that the tariffs being applied as of mid-May 2025 remain in place throughout 2025 and 2026. It is also assumed that some disruptions to shipping in the Red Sea persist through 2025 and 2026. The cut-off date for information used in the projections is May 27, 2025. OECD quarterly projections are on a seasonal and working-day-adjusted basis for selected key variables. This implies that differences between adjusted and unadjusted annual data may occur, though these in general are quite small. In some countries, official forecasts of annual figures do not include working-day adjustments. Even when official forecasts do adjust for working days, the size of the adjustment may in some cases differ from that used by the OECD.  65 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Summary Weak investment has weighed on potential output growth since the global financial crisis (GFC), despite historically low financing costs and strong corporate profitability. Subdued aggregate demand and elevated uncertainty have dampened real business investment, but explain only around half of the investment shortfall since the GFC. In parallel, structural shifts, particularly the growing importance of digital assets and evolving corporate behaviour, have become more prominent. As economies have transitioned toward more digital and knowledge-intensive production – accelerated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution – businesses have increasingly allocated investment toward software, data, computing hardware, and research and development. Firms have also channelled a lower share of their retained earnings and borrowed funds into productive investment, while requiring persistently high rates of return, or ‘hurdle rates’. These trends may be associated with underlying forces that restrain business investment and dynamism, including declining competitive pressures and the challenges in financing intangible investments. At the same time, residential investment has struggled to keep pace with strong housing demand, contributing to a steady erosion in affordability over the past few decades. Public investment – although showing some recent signs of recovery – has also been weak in many countries for an extended period. Against this backdrop, the chapter outlines policy approaches to support a revival in investment, including by reducing policy uncertainty, strengthening macroeconomic stability to support growth and advancing structural reforms to reinvigorate business dynamism. Policies that foster competition and improve access to finance are needed to unlock new investment opportunities and boost innovation in many countries. Reforms to ease land-use and planning restrictions and rental market regulations would help expand residential investment and improve affordability. Finally, high-quality public investment – particularly in energy security and green and digital infrastructure, research and development, health, and education – is needed in many economies and can help boost productivity and long-term economic growth. A prolonged period of weak investment has weighed on potential output growth Underlying growth prospects have weakened considerably over the past two decades, both in advanced and emerging-market economies. Weak growth in the capital stock has been an important factor behind the slowdown in potential output per capita growth in many countries, alongside a decline in multi-factor productivity (MFP) growth. Potential output per capita growth fell by 0.8 percentage points in the median advanced country and 0.9 percentage points in the median emerging-market economy between the 2002-2008 period and 2024. Weaker growth in capital per worker accounted for 0.5 percentage points of the decline in potential GDP per capita growth in the median advanced country, and 0.3 percentage points in the median emerging-market country. The slowdown in capital accumulation has weighed on potential growth across nearly all countries (Figure 2.1, Panel A), including those with relatively strong overall growth performance, such as India and China. 2. Reigniting investment for more resilient growth 66  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The aggregate slowdown in capital accumulation masks notable cross-country differences (Figure 2.1, Panel B). In the advanced economies, capital stock growth has been particularly weak in Japan, Italy, Greece and Portugal during the past 15 years. The United States has observed steadier growth, albeit still below levels observed in the period before the GFC. Capital stocks in emerging-market economies have grown slightly faster on average than in advanced economies, reflecting greater investment needs. Nevertheless, some major emerging-market economies, such as Brazil, Argentina and South Africa, have seen weak capital stock growth, while others, such as Chile, have experienced high growth rates, but still a marked slowdown in capital stock growth over the past two decades.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/guel8r  67 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The slowdown in capital accumulation largely reflects the lasting impact of two major shocks – the GFC and the COVID-19 pandemic – which led to notable declines in real investment from which most economies have recovered only partially. Total real investment, which measures the volume of gross fixed capital formation across the economy, contracted sharply during the GFC as economic growth weakened and financing conditions tightened. The subsequent recovery was relatively modest. Investment declined again during the pandemic, rebounding only partially thereafter, with other events such as Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine and rising energy prices also weighing on capital formation. As a result, aggregate real investment volumes across advanced countries remained approximately 22% below their pre-GFC trend and 7% below the pre-COVID trend at end-2024 (Figure 2.2, Panel A). An investment shortfall is also evident in emerging markets, though it developed more gradually, as investment was less affected by the GFC than in advanced economies. Investment in emerging-market economies on average is estimated to be approximately 33% below the pre-GFC trend, although it is slightly above the pre-COVID trend due to recent robust growth in India and Indonesia (Figure 2.2, Panel B). This investment slowdown has been widespread across countries. Most have continued to see weak capital formation in recent years, with a few exceptions, such as the United States, India and Indonesia, where investment growth has been relatively strong. Figure 2.2. Real investment remains below the pre-GFC and pre-pandemic trends in many economies Real total investment Note: Real investment across 33 advanced economies and 13 emerging-market economies (Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Romania, South Africa, Thailand, and Türkiye).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/i378g1 While the ratio of gross investment to GDP has risen in recent years in some countries, net investment - the addition to the capital stock after accounting for depreciation - remains weak across OECD countries. Since the pre-GFC period, average net investment rates across the OECD have declined by over 0.9 percentage points of GDP, from 2.5 to 1.6 per cent of GDP for the median country, with the fall in net investment strongest in the euro area. The overall decline in net investment has been primarily driven by the drop in business net investment - the largest share of total investment – though reductions in residential and public net investment have also contributed (Figure 2.3). The declines primarily reflect weakness in underlying investment volumes. The fall in prices of investment goods relative to overall prices played a significant role in the lower net investment-to-GDP ratios of the 1990s and early 2000s, but relative prices have since broadly stabilised in the post-GFC period. 68  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.3.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/i0l8cf Business investment has been held back by subdued demand, elevated uncertainty and structural factors Business investment, which accounts for over 60% of total investment in the average OECD country, has remained comparatively weak in most economies for which data are available. Notable exceptions are the United States and France, where business investment has grown more robustly. The weakness has been widespread, affecting most sectors (Figure 2.4, Panel A) and both large and small firms (Hanappi, Millot and Turban, 2023). Changes in the sectoral composition – such as an increasing share of less investment-intensive sectors such as services and a declining share of more capital-intensive manufacturing – seem to have played only a limited role. Instead, the decline in investment has been largely driven by within-sector dynamics (Figure 2.4, Panel B).  69 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.4. Business investment has been weak across sectors Note: In Panel A, the graph plots the coefficient β𝑠from the regression 𝑖𝑐,𝑡 𝑠 = α𝑐 𝑠 + β𝑠 × 𝑡 + ϵ𝑐,𝑡 𝑠 for each sector s, showing the average annual change in the net investment rate over the period 1997-2021, expressed in percentage points.

Source: OECD National Accounts database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/uxm0f4 Aggregate demand accounts for part of the weakness but investment ‘gaps’ remain One key factor contributing to the weakness in business investment relative to earlier trends is more subdued growth in aggregate demand. In many countries, real output fell sharply following both the GFC and the pandemic, and recovered only partially relative to its pre-crisis trend. Corporate investment is closely linked to output growth, as stronger demand incentivises firms to expand capacity. Empirical analysis based on an accelerator model suggests that weak aggregate demand is an important factor explaining business investment performance. Yet, it accounts for only around one-third of the overall shortfall in real business investment relative to the pre-GFC trend (Figure 2.5, Panel A) on average, for the 17 countries with available data. In contrast, the accelerator model suggests that business investment was broadly in line with output growth in the period leading up to the financial crisis. The remaining shortfall may be viewed as an investment ‘gap’, defined as the shortfall in investment not attributable to output developments. This investment ‘gap’ is around 17% of the predicted investment level on average and is even larger in some countries – exceeding 30% in Australia, Korea, and the Netherlands (Figure 2.5, Panel B). 70  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Investment gaps have widened over time, pointing to the growing importance of non-demand factors in explaining weak investment. In the immediate wake of the GFC (2008-2011), the gap was small, suggesting that demand effects accounted for most of the investment weakness, although credit supply and debt overhangs may also have contributed. Between 2012 and 2019, the gap widened gradually, and from 2020 onward, the COVID-19 shock contributed to a further increase. On average, developments since 2020 account for roughly one-quarter of the unexplained slowdown in investment. The impact of the pandemic on the investment gap has been particularly sizeable in some countries, such as Belgium, Denmark and Sweden (Figure 2.5, Panel B). Figure 2.5. Business investment ‘gaps’ are large across OECD economies Decomposition of shortfalls in real business investment compared to pre-GFC trend Note: The investment gap is calculated as the shortfall relative to predicted investment from a simple accelerator model that relates real business investment growth to its own lag and to current real output growth (Annex 2.A). Predicted real business investment is calculated from 2008 to 2023 as the fitted values from the model using actual growth rates of GDP and lagged investment. The overall shortfall in real business investment relative to the pre-GFC trend in 2023 is then decomposed into a part that is explained by the model, interpreted as demand (calculated as trend investment minus predicted investment) and an unexplained part, or ‘gap’ (calculated as predicted investment minus actual investment, as a per cent of predicted investment). The country sample includes 17 OECD countries for which data on real business investment are available. Panel A shows the results for the OECD aggregate, calculated as a weighted average of the countries in Panel B using GDP PPP weights. Panel B shows investment gaps in per cent of predicted investment, for countries with available data. Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/vjcbw1 Investment ‘gaps’ cannot be fully explained by the cost of capital, company valuations and profitability Business investment gaps have opened up despite a marked decline in the user cost of capital (UCC) across most economies. The UCC, which captures the cost of financing and maintaining capital –factoring in borrowing costs, relative prices, taxes, and depreciation – has trended downward steadily over the past few decades until the recent moves to tighten monetary policy (Figure 2.6, Panel A). Borrowing costs dropped to historically low levels following the monetary policy easing in response to the GFC, and while they have risen more recently, they remain well below long-term averages (Figure 2.6, Panel B). Effective corporate tax rates have also declined, with several OECD countries having reduced the main statutory rate (Figure 2.6, Panel C), and changes to tax provisions have further lowered the effective cost of capital in some countries. Simultaneously, the price of investment goods relative to overall output prices fell throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, largely due to sustained improvements in the quality and efficiency of ICT-related capital (Figure 2.6, Panel C).  71 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 At the same time, corporate valuations have remained favourable to higher investment. When the ratio of a firm's market valuation to the replacement cost of its assets (Tobin’s Q) is above one, markets expect firms can earn returns on new investment that exceed investment costs. Firm-level data from listed companies in a subset of OECD countries indicate that Tobin’s Q has remained above this threshold since the GFC. In the United States and some Scandinavian countries, valuations have risen strongly in recent years, whereas valuations have been flat or increased only gradually in most European and other advanced economies (Figure 2.6, Panel D).1 Figure 2.6. The cost of capital has fallen and company valuations have held up Note: Panel A: The user cost of capital UCC is calculated using the relative price of investment, the real interest rate based on the 10-year government bond yield and 10-year ahead inflation expectations from professional forecasts, the depreciation rate, the statutory corporate tax rate and the share of debt in corporate liabilities (debt plus equity). Panel C: The relative price of investment is measured as the ratio of the investment and GDP deflators.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/bpkizw 1 Differences in the valuation of firms in advanced economies and their US counterparts may be driven by several factors. These include the traditionally stronger institutional framework in the United States —including corporate governance standards and financial market infrastructure—greater market capacity to absorb global risks, and higher expectations for future investment returns (La Porta et al., 1998). The relative undervaluation of “brown” firms (those with higher carbon emissions) in other developed countries, compared to the United States, may also contribute to this premium (Doidge, Karolyi and Stulz, 2020). 72  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Firms’ profitability and cash resources also do not appear to have acted as constraints. Subdued corporate investment in advanced economies since the GFC has coincided with the corporate sector shifting from being a net borrower to net lender on aggregate (Figure 2.7, Panel A). Gross corporate savings as a share of GDP have increased in more than half of the OECD countries with available data, driven by stronger profits, proportionally lower tax payments, and lower interest expenditures, although this has been partially offset by higher dividends in some countries including the United States, Canada and the Netherlands (Figure 2.7, Panel B). Overall, the ratio of net investment to net sales has also declined, implying that higher sales have not been proportionally matched with higher investment. Taken together, this suggests that capital costs, valuation signals and firms’ profitability cannot explain the weakness in business investment. Moreover, proxy measures of the UCC, Tobin’s Q and firms’ profitability are not statistically significant when added to the accelerator model (see Annex A), pointing instead to the growing importance of other determinants in explaining investment, particularly since 2012. These are likely to include heightened economic uncertainty and structural factors, such as changing investment patterns towards digital assets and evolving corporate behaviour. Figure 2.7. Strong corporate profitability has not translated into higher gross fixed capital investment Note: Panel A contains 33 OECD countries. It shows gross fixed capital formation and gross savings for the non-financial corporate sector as a per cent of nominal GDP, aggregated up to the OECD level. The difference between gross fixed capital investment and gross savings is approximately equal to net lending, but can vary depending on changes in inventories, other non-financial produced assets, and net capital transfers. In Panel B, the decomposition is based on the distribution of income account for the non-financial corporate sector within the System of National Accounts: Gross operating surplus = Gross saving + Net property income paid + Current taxes on income + Social transfers + Other transfers, where Net property income paid = Dividends - reinvested earnings on foreign direct investment + net interest paid + rents on land (for more information see (Chen, Loukas and Brent, 2017)). Source: OECD National Accounts database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/e253dn Elevated uncertainty is likely to have held back investment Elevated uncertainty – both macroeconomic and policy related – is likely to have weighed on investment incentives and encouraged precautionary cash accumulation. Firms may hesitate to commit to long-term capital spending projects when the outlook for global demand, trade policy, or regulatory frameworks is unclear. Economic policy uncertainty indicators started to increase steadily around 2016, and trade policy uncertainty became elevated in the 2017-2020 period (Figure 2.8, Panel A). Empirical estimates (Box 2.1) suggest policy uncertainty may have accounted for approximately one-sixth of the overall investment shortfall relative to the pre-GFC trend (Figure 2.5, Panel A), and around one-quarter of the ‘gap’ across OECD countries (Figure 2.5, Panel B). Furthermore, recent survey evidence suggests that uncertainty is increasingly a major obstacle to investment for firms (Figure 2.8, Panel B).  73 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 More recently, measures of policy uncertainty have spiked due to heightened concerns about economic risks from tariffs on international trade. Estimates suggest that if these levels of high-uncertainty persist, the resulting decline in investment growth could lead to real investment being up to 1.4 percentage points lower by end-2026 (Box 2.1). In contrast, if policy uncertainty reverts to the average levels observed over the 2015-2019 period, investment could be 1.8 percentage points higher by end-2026 compared to a baseline where economic policy uncertainty remains at current levels. Figure 2.8. Uncertainty has increased, becoming a greater obstacle to investment Note: For Panel A, the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) is based on Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016) and the Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU) index is from Caldara et al (2019). The EPU index is a nominal GDP-weighted average of national EPU for 21 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. The TPU index is based on automated text searches of the electronic archives of seven newspapers.

Economic policy uncertainty and business investment in OECD countries Policy uncertainty has increased sharply in recent months across OECD countries. Elevated uncertainty can be a drag on business investment as firms often delay or scale back capital spending when future conditions are unclear. Earlier studies have found that the increase in US economic policy uncertainty in the 2005-2012 period was associated with a peak decline of 6% in US gross fixed investment (Baker, Bloom and Davis, 2016). Focusing on trade policy uncertainty, an increase equivalent to that observed during the 2018 period of higher tariffs has been found to be associated with a decline in private investment of 1-2% (Caldara et al., 2019). The impact of policy uncertainty on investment in OECD economies is quantified using a panel Vector Autoregression (VAR) model with quarterly data. The model includes real business investment, GDP, the GDP deflator, short-term interest rates and a measure of economic uncertainty, the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, developed by Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016), capturing both country-specific and global shocks. Results suggest that a one standard deviation increase in economic policy uncertainty reduces business investment growth by around 1 percentage point after one year, with the impact peaking after four quarters (Figure 2.9). This suggests that the increase in uncertainty during recent years may have reduced 74  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 annual investment growth by 0.4 percentage points on average across OECD countries, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the investment ‘gap’ shown in Figure 2.5. To illustrate the potential future implications, two scenarios are considered: • Lower economic policy uncertainty would lift investment growth. In a “confidence rebound scenario” where uncertainty declines from its value at the end of 2024 to the average levels over the 2015-2019 period by end-2025, the associated cumulative gain in business investment would be around 1.8 percentage points by end-2026 as compared to a baseline where economic policy uncertainty remains at current levels. • However, if current levels of high uncertainty persist and only decline towards their 2024 average, the resulting decline in investment growth could lead to real investment being 1.4 percentage points lower by end-2026. Figure 2.9. An uncertainty shock decreases business investment and GDP Note: Panels show the impact of a one standard deviation increase in economic policy uncertainty on business investment (Panel A) and GDP (Panel B). Grey shaded areas depict 90% confidence bands. The results are based on a panel VAR model for nine OECD countries with available data on business investment and economic policy uncertainty (Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States). The panel VAR specification features four lags of growth rates of GDP, GDP deflator, business investment, economic policy uncertainty (Baker, Bloom and Davis, 2016), the first difference of short-term interest rates and a linear trend. The model is estimated at quarterly frequency over 1997Q1 to 2024Q4. The identification of the structural shock to economic policy uncertainty rests on a Cholesky triangularisation of the variance-covariance matrix of the reduced-form residuals. The uncertainty shock is ordered first, implying that it affects all other variables at time t. Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and OECD calculations.

The remaining weakness is likely to be related to broader structural changes within the economy. As economies transition toward more digital and knowledge-intensive production – accelerated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution – investment has increasingly shifted toward intangibles, especially digital assets. At the same time, firms have channelled a lower share of their retained earnings and borrowed funds into productive investment, while maintaining persistently high required rates of return, or ‘hurdle rates’. Both these trends are likely to be associated with underlying factors that dampen investment, including declining competitive pressures and the rise of dominant firms, particularly in the digital sector, and difficulties in financing intangible investments. Investment in digital- and knowledge-based assets has increased The transition towards a more digital and knowledge-intensive economy in recent years has had a significant impact on the composition of business investment. Investment has been channelled into knowledge-based intangible assets, such as software, data, and research and development (R&D), and complementary tangible investments, such as ICT hardware, including servers, networking equipment, and cloud infrastructure (André and Gal, 2024). Together, these assets are an important driver of firm productivity and innovation (Corrado et al., 2021). Real investment in digital and knowledge assets has outpaced other asset classes across most advanced economies (Figure 2.10). Real investment in software has increased three-fold since 2008 on average in OECD economies, while investment in ICT hardware and R&D has grown by around 100% and 45%, respectively, over the same period, compared to aggregate growth of 12% for machinery and a 7% decline in investment in structures. Digital investment has expanded particularly rapidly in countries such as the United States and France, which have also seen strong growth in overall investment. In contrast, several countries, including Germany, have witnessed more modest increases. Investment has expanded particularly rapidly in tech-related firms (Figure 2.11). Firm-level data also show that AI-related companies invest in physical capital at nearly twice the rate of other firms, with their R&D investment rates more than three times higher (Figure 2.12). At the same time, firms appear to not be undertaking all the available profitable marginal investments that lower costs of finance should encourage. The average pre-tax rate of return on corporate capital assets has remained high in many economies in recent years, after dropping during the GFC and pandemic (Figure 2.15, Panel A). There is also evidence that required returns on investment have increased, since the gap between hurdle rates – the minimum expected return a firm requires to proceed with an investment – and capital costs has widened (Figure 2.16, Panels A and B) (OECD, 2015; Shah, Bunn and Melolinna, 2024). While rising policy uncertainty may have contributed to higher risk premia and thus higher hurdle rates, the scale of the increase points to additional underlying structural factors. 76  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.10.

The relatively stronger growth of digital and knowledge-based investment has not been sufficient to offset the impact of rising depreciation and weak tangible investment. Thus, net business investment as a share of GDP has declined across most OECD countries, despite a notable rise in digital and R&D investment (Figure 2.3). This decline reflects sluggish growth in traditional tangible investment categories — such as infrastructure and machinery — which still account for the largest share of business investment, alongside the higher depreciation rates for digital and knowledge-based capital (Figure 2.13, Panels A and B). On average, digital and knowledge-based assets now make up just over 35% of total capital formation, in current prices, up from around 28% at the turn of the century (Figure 2.13, Panel C).2 As investment has shifted toward these faster-depreciating assets, the overall depreciation or ‘scrapping’ rate has risen. 2 Despite ongoing enhancements to the National Accounts, some types of intangible assets are still not captured in business investment statistics, such as organisational and marketing capital. Some attempts have been made to measure these newer types of intangibles, suggesting that around half of intangible investments are not captured in official national accounts (Corrado et al., 2021). 78  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.13.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/k83o0q Corporate behaviour has shifted towards greater cash accumulation, higher shareholder payouts and rising required returns Instead of investing in fixed assets, firms have increasingly allocated savings toward accumulating financial assets or distributed earnings to investors through dividends and share buybacks. The increase in corporate net financial asset positions has been predominantly associated with the accumulation of financial assets rather than reductions in debt (Figure 2.14, Panel A). Firm-level data suggest that rising corporate gross operating surpluses have been associated with increased cash holdings and higher shareholder payouts, mainly through dividends (Figure 2.14, Panels C and D). In the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, share buybacks have also contributed significantly to this trend.3 Concurrently, the number and value of corporate mergers and acquisitions remained elevated during much of the post-GFC period, particularly in the United States and Europe, indicating that financial resources were utilised to acquire existing capital assets from other companies, rather than to expand the overall capital stock through internal investments (Figure 2.14, Panels E and F). Another possible use of corporate savings would be to invest in other countries, but there is little sign of this in outward foreign direct investment flows from the major economies, other than in Japan (Figure 2.14, Panel B). 3 The low cost of borrowing may also have incentivised firms to undertake non-investment financial activities such as leveraged buybacks and debt refinancing.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/1jgaxn Shifts in the composition of investment and corporate behaviour have coincided with rising market concentration, higher markups and difficulties in accessing finance Market concentration has risen and business dynamism declined across advanced economies. These developments are increasingly linked to weak investment (Calligaris et al., 2024). Measures of industry concentration have risen in Europe and the United States, while product market concentration has also increased in European economies (Figure 2.17). At the same time, data from listed firms show a notable increase in markups – measured as the ratio of total revenue to the cost of goods sold – across most  81 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 advanced economies, with Italy being a notable exception (Figure 2.18). 4 Among emerging-market economies, markups have increased in India and South Africa but eased slightly in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia and Mexico. Net investment rates among listed firms have declined in all countries apart from Korea over the same period. In parallel with rising market concentration, business investment has also become increasingly concentrated among a small group of highly profitable “superstar” firms (Autor, 2020). This trend is closely linked to shifts in the composition of investment, as the greater scalability of intangible assets tends to boost returns for a limited number of firms, reinforcing “winner-takes-most” dynamics (Haksel and Westlake, 2018). The rise in overall market power appears particularly pronounced in the digital sector (Nicoletti, Vitale and Abate, 2023). These dynamics are further reinforced by growing concentration in institutional ownership. The widespread use of passive investment vehicles and consolidation in the asset management sector mean that many competing firms now share common large shareholders (Schmalz, 2017). Ownership concentration can weaken incentives for competition and has been associated with lower corporate investment (Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2018; Azar, Schmalz and Tecu, 2018). Figure 2.17.

Increased market concentration can suppress investment through several channels. One is that dominant firms may restrict output and raise prices rather than invest in expanding capacity, particularly when competitive pressure is limited (Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2017). Another mechanism is that only large ‘superstar’ firms have the financial resources, managerial capability, and know-how to make large-scale investments with uncertain payback periods, effectively crowding out investment by smaller, less productive, or new firms (Crouzet and Eberly, 2019). Firm-level data suggests that large firms account for a higher share of investment relative to their output, although the gap has not increased over time (Hanappi, Millot and Turban, 2023). In reality, the relationship between market power and investment is likely to be nuanced, and firm specific. For example, firms may first achieve market power through innovation and efficiency, gaining scale through network effects and intangible synergies. Over time, however, some may shift their focus from innovation and fixed capital investment toward rent-seeking strategies, such as regulatory capture and lobbying, to preserve their dominant position (Akcigit and Ates, 2021). The availability of finance is a second key channel connecting the observed rise in intangible assets and precautionary corporate behaviour such as cash accumulation and high hurdle rates. Investment in software, data, and R&D as well as other intangibles, is harder to finance through bank loans, as these assets are more difficult to value and hence use as collateral. As a result, firms may need to self-finance these assets through retained earnings and higher cash holdings to reduce dependence on external financing (Demmou, Stefanescu, and Arquie, 2019), reducing available resources for investment. These constraints can be particularly binding for smaller firms and those operating in bank-based financial systems with less developed capital markets. Taken together, increased market concentration and financing challenges for intangibles provide additional plausible explanations for the persistent weakness in business investment. The relative importance of these factors likely varies across countries, sectors, and firms. Other factors may also have played a role. Rising investment costs – including limited land availability, planning delays, regulatory burdens, and implementation capacity constraints – can also deter firms from launching new projects. Moreover, the growing tendency of firms to prioritise shareholder payouts over reinvestment may reflect increasing financialisation (Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2017) and incentives such as shareholder pressure to shift corporate strategy toward maximising short-term financial returns at the expense of long-term productive investment.  83 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Other structural trends – such as ageing populations and labour shortages - may also have restrained business investment, particularly in advanced economies. When firms anticipate slower growth in the working-age population, they may revise down expected demand for goods and services, reducing the need to expand productive capacity. This may more than offset any stimulative effects on investment from the downward pressure on real interest rates associated with higher savings in ageing populations — although this effect may also wane as retirees dissave (Eggertsson, Mehrotra and Robbins, 2019). Meanwhile, persistent skill shortages have emerged in some countries and sectors (OECD, 2024a), with over 50% of EU and US firms identifying the scarcity of skilled staff as a major obstacle to investment (Figure 2.21 Panel B). If firms are unable to find the necessary skills to implement, operate or maintain new capital – and fully reap their benefits -, they may postpone investment projects, particularly high-skill, high-tech investments that require complementary human capital, such as ICT and green technology.5 Housing investment has fallen short of demand, reducing affordability Residential housing investment accounts for around a fifth of total of total investment across OECD countries and has also slowed in recent decades (Figure 2.19, Panel A). Following a period of strong housing investment in some economies prior to the GFC, the subsequent tightening in credit conditions, household deleveraging, and the marked downturn in many housing markets contributed to a dramatic fall in residential investment during 2008-09.6 Although growth in housing investment eventually recovered, the past decade has seen a further steady decline. This was interrupted only briefly by a spike in activity following the pandemic in the context of low interest rates, increased demand for larger living spaces and government support measures. Real housing investment has contracted in recent years and continued to do so in most OECD countries over the year to the fourth quarter of 2024. A structural shortfall in housing investment relative to demand has contributed to rising house prices. Several factors have fuelled housing demand, including urbanisation, population growth, rising incomes, increased immigration, a shift toward smaller households, and greater access to mortgage credit (OECD, 2021). The supply-demand imbalance is a key reason why house prices and rents in many OECD countries have risen significantly faster than both inflation and household incomes over time, eroding affordability. These pressures are particularly acute in major cities and economically dynamic regions, where growth in demand for housing has far outpaced supply. Consequently, housing costs have absorbed an increasing share of household budgets, often at the expense of other essential spending categories such as food and transport (Figure 2.19, Panel B). Between 2000 and 2023, the share of consumption spent on housing rose by an average of close to three percentage points, reaching 17% in the median OECD country. The low responsiveness of housing supply to growing demand reflects a range of structural and regulatory constraints (OECD, 2021). The time required for planning and construction means supply adjustments are sticky, allowing price pressures to build up. In addition, rising construction and renovation costs (OECD, 2023), partly driven by stricter energy efficiency and environmental sustainability standards, have added to overall investment costs. Demand has been particularly concentrated in job-rich urban areas, where geographical limitations and regulatory restrictions, including land-use and zoning rules, are most restrictive (Cournède, De Pace and Ziemann, 2020). Other factors, such as rental market regulations, landlord-tenant laws, and labour shortages also affect the efficient functioning of housing markets and the construction sector, potentially discouraging investment in both the construction and maintenance 5 In other instances, companies in industries facing major shortages may choose to automate parts of their production instead, leading to increased investment in tangible capital (Dorville, Filippucci and Marcolin, forthcoming). 6 In some countries, housing investment growth prior to the GFC was excessive, with residential investment rising well above historical averages and exceeding 8% of GDP, including Spain and Ireland and reflected in surges in mortgage credit and household debt-to-GDP ratios. 84  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 of dwellings. In addition, persistently low productivity growth in the housing construction sector—often attributed to regulatory factors—may further undermine cost-efficiency and scalability (D’Amico et al., 2024).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/mzgpkh Public investment has picked up but remains below pre-GFC levels Public investment – accounting for around one sixth of total investment across OECD countries – declined significantly in many economies in the aftermath of the GFC. The decline was largely due to fiscal consolidation efforts, particularly in euro area countries that faced acute sovereign debt pressures (OECD, 2015). In contrast, the policy response to the pandemic was different, with many governments raising public investment to support the recovery (Figure 2.20, Panel A). This was especially evident in the European Union, where initiatives such as the NextGenerationEU funds have played a central role in boosting investment. A substantial share of these recovery packages was directed towards investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable transport infrastructure to support demand and progress toward long-term climate goals. Despite the recent upturn in some countries, critical public investment needs remain. Net public investment – after accounting for the depreciation of the existing capital stock – remains below pre-GFC levels (Figure 2.3, Panel C), raising concerns about deteriorating infrastructure in some countries and sectors. The stock of public capital relative to GDP has stagnated or declined over the past decade in many countries. Marked sectoral differences have emerged: while the share of public investment has increased in areas such as energy, defence, and healthcare, other sectors such as transport have declined (Figure 2.20, Panel B). Such declines can lead to quality shortfalls. The perceived quality of transport infrastructure declined in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, for example, in the years prior to the pandemic (World Economic Forum, 2019), while declines in education performance were signalled by PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) scores declining across many OECD countries between 2018 and 2022. Moreover, insufficient public investment may also constrain private investment, as inadequate transportation, energy or digital infrastructure can limit firms’ growth and investment opportunities.  85 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Recent announcements of further increases in defence spending – particularly among European countries in response to heightened geopolitical tensions – are expected to result in some increase in public spending. However, the overall boost to public investment may be modest, as only around 20% of defence spending tends to be allocated to capital investment (see Chapter 1). Figure 2.20.

For the pandemic, the change is the difference between the ratio in 2023 and the average ratio over 2017–2019.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/4l2j5z Public policy reforms can help reinvigorate investment Public policies help shape the factors identified above as underpinning recent investment trends. Clear and predictable measures that incentivise business investment are particularly important, given business investment has been the main component behind the weakness in net aggregate investment across countries. Key messages from the analysis above are the importance of reducing policy uncertainty, promoting competition and business dynamism and alleviating financing constraints for intangible investment. These are consistent with many of the country-specific policy recommendations for boosting investment in Chapter 3 and summarised in Panel A of Figure 2.21, and would help overcome some of the key obstacles to investment commonly cited by businesses (Figure 2.21, Panel B). Outside of the business sector, there is scope to boost housing investment in some countries through regulatory reforms that include the easing of land-use restrictions and rental market regulations. In addition, high-quality public investment – particularly in green and digital infrastructure, research and development, health, and education – is needed in many economies and can boost potential output growth, especially if it crowds-in private investment spending. 86  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.21.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/vnz762 Reducing policy uncertainty would support stronger investment growth Clear and predictable public policy is needed to assuage economic policy uncertainty and help rejuvenate investment growth, as highlighted in Box 1. While the predominant factor behind the recent rise in economic policy uncertainty in advanced economies has been higher trade policy uncertainty, available measures also show increased uncertainty since early 2024 in categories related to fiscal, regulatory and climate policies. As such, improving the general clarity and predictability of economic policies in all areas of government could underpin stronger investment rates. This is a policy recommendation contained in many of the country notes in Chapter 3, including for the United States, Hungary, Korea and Türkiye. One potential channel is that reduced uncertainty could prompt businesses to reduce the risk-premia incorporated in the hurdle rates used for investment decisions (European Investment Bank, 2024). Specific approaches to reduce policy uncertainty may include:  87 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 • Conducting trade policy through a transparent and rules-based system with efforts made by governments to avoid introducing sudden policy changes that are unpredictable for businesses and consumers. Working together within the global trading system to find ways of addressing concerns with current trading arrangements could also help governments provide certainty about the future. • Reducing fiscal policy uncertainty by legislating and implementing credible medium-term strategies for achieving sustainable public finances amid rising fiscal pressures (e.g. from population ageing, climate change and defence spending). Strengthening fiscal frameworks by reinforcing transparent, rules-based approaches – while ensuring that fiscal rules are designed with well-defined, credible escape clauses – can help maintain policy credibility while preserving flexibility in the face of major shocks. Implementing stable and predictable tax rules, combined with clear dispute resolution mechanisms, can also help mitigate uncertainty (Box 2.3). • Reducing complexity and improving transparency around domestic structural policy changes in areas such as regulation of product and labour markets, migration policy and the financial system. Undertaking robust and transparent regulatory impact assessments would help give investors greater certainty. In addition, efforts to build a strong consensus around structural reforms by working with key stakeholders will support their longevity. • Affirming ongoing international commitments to mitigate climate change and outlining the policy approach to achieving climate commitments. At the same time, implementing well-designed adaptation measures that minimise the potential economic cost of future disruptions from climate change would provide greater certainty about the future operating environment. Various framework conditions shape the incentives to invest Policies and institutional arrangements shape the incentives of firms to invest, their ability to attract the required resources to do so and overall economic stability. Sound macroeconomic policies and a healthy financial system are the foundation of strong and resilient investment growth. Monetary policy should focus on achieving low and stable inflation and any additional statutory objectives. In some emerging market and developing economies, additional efforts to entrench credible monetary policy frameworks could provide greater monetary policy certainty and help anchor inflation expectations. In addition, macroprudential policy tools should be developed and deployed where necessary to guard against the build-up of systemic financial risks that might become the basis for future financial shocks and impede access to finance. Structural reforms can promote business dynamism and encourage firms to sharpen their focus on innovating and investing to stay ahead of competitors. Reducing the cost of regulations to businesses, both through reforming de jure regulations and implementing them in a way that does not unnecessarily raise costs, promotes firm entry and the ability of successful firms to expand. This can help mitigate trends towards rising market concentration, including in markets based around new intangible assets such as artificial intelligence technologies. Country-specific policy recommendations to promote investment by improving aspects of competition policy are made in the majority of country notes in Chapter 3 (Figure 2.21, Panel A). In emerging-market economies, clear and predictable regulatory frameworks can also reassure foreign investors about the operating environment. While, in theory, more restrictive domestic regulations could simply encourage firms to invest abroad, this is only an option for a subset of firms in certain sectors, with foreign investment more likely to be determined by a need to enter foreign markets, or acquire resources, or link to research or financial centres. Indeed, the available evidence does not support the notion that foreign investment is a substitute for domestic investment (Desai et al., 2005; Goldbach et al., 2019), with the importance of a wide variety of structural policies for domestic investment growth empirically well established (Égert, 2021). 88  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 New OECD estimates indicate that reducing product market regulation in network industries is associated with an increase in the capital stock in downstream business sectors. Policy experiments suggest that network sector deregulation between 1980 and 2023 could have raised the capital stock by around 4% in the average OECD economy, with gains reaching 10% in manufacturing and 5% in business services (Figure 2.22, Panel A). Looking ahead, bringing regulations in more highly-regulated economies towards the regulatory levels of their least-regulated peers could raise the economy-wide capital stock by up to 1.5%, with notably larger impacts for the manufacturing sector (Figure 2.22, Panel B). The effective design and implementation of product market regulations can also be hampered by the influence of lobbying activities. Reforms that improve the transparency and accountability of lobbying could address this and weaken the potential for regulations to be captured by incumbent firms and fuel rising market concentration (OECD, 2024b). Figure 2.22. Investment would benefit from further product market reforms Note: Panel A estimates are based on Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares regression results of how upstream regulation in network sectors, captured by the OECD’s REGIMPACT indicator, affects the capital stock (see Andrews et al. 2025 for further details). Panel B shows the potential capital stock gains from three reform scenarios that are based on measures of barriers to entry in network sectors in 2023: (1) convergence of the three most regulated OECD countries to the regulatory levels of the three least regulated (in orange); (2) convergence of the most regulated countries to the OECD average (in green); and (3) convergence of the OECD average to the benchmark set by the three least regulated countries (in blue). Source: Andrews et al. (2025). StatLink 2https://stat.link/9hswyg Well-functioning insolvency frameworks promote business dynamism by encouraging firms to invest and resources to be efficiently allocated from weaker exiting businesses to higher performing ones. At the same time, overly stringent bankruptcy regimes can deter risk-taking, weighing on innovation and bias firms’ choice of capital structure towards tangible investments at the expense of intangibles (Garcia-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2014). This is highlighted by OECD analysis showing that the economic gains from lowering barriers to efficient corporate restructuring increase with a sector’s intangible asset intensity (André and Demmou, 2022). Many countries have undertaken important reforms to insolvency frameworks over the past decade. Between 2016 and 2022, there was particularly notable progress in Europe and Canada (André and Demmou, 2022). Nonetheless, there remains scope for additional regulatory efforts in most countries to streamline insolvency processes, refine restructuring tools and improve the treatment of failed entrepreneurs.  89 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The stringency and complexity of land use regulations influence business dynamism and housing investment by determining the activities that can be undertaken in a certain location. More stringent and complex land use provisions can be a barrier to firm entry and moderate investment in physical assets in some sectors such as retail trade, as well as dwelling investment. Reducing complexity and introducing greater flexibility in zoning systems, including by being less prescriptive about the specific activities that can be undertaken on a parcel of land, can enable firm entry and growth, as well as the ability of the economy to adapt to ongoing structural change. Based on the country notes in Chapter 3, such recommendations appear to be particularly relevant in Australia, Austria, Croatia and Sweden. Sub\u0002national governments are often responsible for land use regulations and the implementation of planning approvals. Ensuring these administrations have sufficient fiscal incentives to reduce the complexity of regulations and streamline approvals can be important. An example is Switzerland, where local government finances are heavily reliant on property taxation and there is significant flexibility afforded to authorities to set the applicable tax rates. Efforts to harmonise regulations across sub-national jurisdictions and minimise responsibility overlaps could also reduce the cost of business investment, as well as promote spending on the housing stock. Indeed, a high degree of decentralisation of land-use decisions and responsibility overlaps are empirically associated with high rigidity of housing supply (Bétin and Ziemann, 2019). As discussed earlier, overly strict rental market regulations have inhibited housing investment in some countries. Regulations such as rent controls and landlord-tenant rules can provide protections for renters but may also reduce incentives to invest in rental housing due to lower rental revenues and the greater difficulty of selling properties (Kholodilin and Kohl, 2020). For instance, rent controls in San Francisco are estimated to have reduced housing supply by as much as 15% (Diamond, McQuade and Qian, 2019). OECD work has found that the house price elasticity of residential construction is considerably lower where there is stringent rental market regulation (Cavalleri, Cournède and Özsöğüt, 2019). Minimising regulatory barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI) can help facilitate the best allocation of global investment and enhance competition. Capital spending may increase in both source and destination countries when vertical FDI is involved, leading to the buildup of global value chains. Nonetheless, as measured by the OECD FDI regulatory restrictiveness index, policy restrictions on inward FDI are high in some economies, especially in emerging-market economies (Figure 2.23). This may have contributed to the modest FDI inflows observed in recent years (Figure 2.14, Panel B). A renewed drive to ease or eliminate FDI policy barriers could support such inflows and capital spending in destination countries. According to the country-specific recommendations in Chapter 3, such a policy approach may be particularly relevant in Costa Rica, Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam, as well as in some advanced economies such as Korea, New Zealand and Switzerland. 90  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.23.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/qkigsw Policies that reduce financing frictions for intangible investment can alleviate the need for firms to retain cash resources to self-finance future intangible investment projects. It may also help enable young and small firms to undertake investment projects, promoting competitive pressures in more concentrated markets. Financial frictions can be especially acute in bank-based financial systems for firms without traditional forms of collateral. Such firms include those with a high proportion of knowledge-based assets and start-ups with limited credit history. Improving the depth of capital markets would support a more diverse range of funding options and promote competition between lenders, thus improving access to finance for new firm entrants and intangible investments. In Europe, making further progress on implementing the Savings and Investments Union will be important in this regard. Reforms that improve access to credit are also relevant in emerging-market economies including Brazil and India (Chapter 3). Developing certain segments of capital markets may require some public financial support and regulatory actions, provided they do not endanger financial stability. Possible examples include adjusting regulatory restrictions on the investment activities of pension providers, reducing administrative requirements on fintech lenders and equity crowdfunding platforms, reforms that enable “open finance”, and public investment in venture capital markets. The latter may be particularly well-suited to funding investments by innovative firms with non-standard risk profiles (Calvino, Criscuolo and Menon, 2015). Government involvement in venture capital deals has been particularly notable in Hungary but has also played a role in many other European economies (Figure 2.24). There can be synergies between promoting venture capital and efforts undertaken in some countries to develop specific public equity markets for smaller and innovative firms (for example, KOSDAQ in Korea, Mothers Exchange in Japan and SME growth markets in the European Union). These exchanges typically have simplified listing and disclosure requirements and can provide an appealing exit option for venture capital investors once successful firms expand (Carvajal and Dider, 2024). Further developing market-based finance could also ease access to finance in emerging\u0002market economies but would often benefit from complementary reforms that promote macro-financial stability and access to digital financial technologies (Banerjee, Mehrotra and Zampolli, 2024).  91 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.24.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/y3opx8 The availability of workers with skills that match business needs can both encourage capital investment and maximise its productivity payoff. This can be aided by structural reforms that lower frictions in the labour market, such as reducing the prevalence of unnecessary non-compete clauses (Andrews and Garnero, 2025). Developing a workforce with skills that evolve with underlying structural changes in the economy can also be an important enabling factor for new capital investment, as skills demands are evolving rapidly with population ageing, the digital and green transitions (OECD, 2024a). More broadly, recent OECD estimates suggest that around one-sixth of the productivity slowdown in OECD countries since the mid-2000s can be accounted for by a weakening in human capital accumulation (Andrews et al., 2024). A key need is for effective government efforts to promote investment in lifelong learning. Policy reform priorities include ensuring strong foundational skills that form the basis for further learning, the availability of high-quality adult training programmes, and encouraging participation in education by adapting programs and qualification requirements, including for those currently in the workforce. High-quality public investment is needed in priority areas Public capital spending can play a key role in supporting aggregate investment, especially when economies are operating at less than full capacity. Where fiscal space allows, public investment can provide an immediate boost to economic activity by stimulating demand and employment, particularly in sectors with strong multiplier effects (Mourougane et al., 2016). In the longer term, high-quality public investment can crowd-in private investment, foster innovation, and raise human capital (Box 2.2), thereby boosting potential output growth. However, public investment can also crowd out private spending—especially in contexts where it increases borrowing costs for firms, either by heightening concerns over debt sustainability, or if it substitutes private investment rather than complements it. Anchoring public investment within a credible medium-term budgetary framework can enhance policy predictability, support prioritisation and sequencing, and strengthen fiscal sustainability (OECD, 2019). Robust public investment management frameworks are essential to ensure the efficiency of public capital spending and its complementarity with private investment. Close coordination with subnational governments is often required, particularly for infrastructure projects with regional development objectives. 92  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Box 2.2. Government investment and growth-enhancing structural outcomes What is the role of public investment in building human capital and fostering innovation? As governments aim to strengthen long-term growth and resilience – particularly in a context of constrained fiscal space – it is crucial that public spending is effectively targeted to areas that yield the greatest returns. This box examines the growth-enhancing effects of government investment in three key areas: research and development (R&D), education, and health. OECD work has long highlighted the importance of investment in these areas for raising potential output growth (Fournier and Johansson, 2016). Public R&D contributes to the economy’s knowledge base and can catalyse private sector innovation. Investment in education strengthens human capital by improving workforce skills, while spending on health supports a productive workforce.1 Figure 2.25.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/9snv6t To quantify the effects of government investment on key growth channels, a framework developed in recent literature on public debt is applied.2 Historical ‘spending surges’ – defined as increases of at least 10% and lasting three years or more – are identified in a panel of OECD countries from 1970 to 2019. This surge-based approach mitigates measurement challenges in fiscal data and improves identification by focusing on large, discrete shifts in spending more likely to be related to policy decisions. The dynamic effects of these surges on structural outcome variables closely linked to long-run growth are estimated using the local projection method (Jordà, 2005). The results suggest that spending surges are associated with meaningful improvements in growth-related outcomes. A sustained increase in government R&D spending increases private R&D expenditure by approximately 6% on average, 5 years after the shock (Figure 2.25). Surges in education spending are associated with a 2½ per cent rise in educational attainment, while increases in health spending reduce infant mortality by 2½ per cent. These effects tend to emerge gradually, underscoring the long-term nature of returns to public investment in these areas. ___________ 1.

There remain significant investment needs in response to climate change. Global financing needs for climate mitigation are estimated at USD 5 trillion a year until 2030 (IMF, 2023). Investment needs for adaptation are also estimated to be large, though lower than for mitigation. Country-specific policy recommendations for increased climate-related public investment are highlighted in Chapter 3 for many advanced economies, as well as Malaysia and Mauritius. To complement public spending, other policy instruments – including pricing of climate-related externalities, information provision and regulations – can help more closely align private incentives with social benefits for climate mitigation and adaptation activities. Targeted public investment in basic research, through grants or publicly conducted R&D, can also catalyse private innovation in fields such as clean energy and climate technologies. Similarly, public investment can help support and encourage private investment in digital infrastructure. Efficient, reliable, and widely accessible digital infrastructure is essential to unlocking the full economic benefits of digitalisation, and public investment is often needed to extend coverage to rural areas or finance costly infrastructure projects with high positive externalities. Tax policy reforms can promote stronger private investment growth Tax policy settings also influence the conditions for private investment. While the recent decline in the user cost of capital has not been accompanied by strong aggregate investment growth in many economies, certain tax policy changes may be effective in incentivising investment spending. Low corporate tax rates on a broad corporate tax base can support investment by limiting the complexity of the tax system for businesses and distortions between different kinds of taxpayers. However, targeted measures such as relatively generous capital allowances or reduced non-profit taxes may be a more cost-effective way to support investment spending than general reductions in the statutory corporate tax rate (Box 2.3). Carefully designed tax incentives can also help address market failures in areas such as R&D spending and clean technology adoption (González Cabral et al., 2023; Dressler and Warwick, 2025). Temporary tax breaks, such as a short-lived acceleration in depreciation deductions, can also have powerful effects by advancing capital spending (Eichfelder and Scheider, 2014). However, such measures can be associated with deadweight costs and lower spending after the tax measure expires. In general, tax incentives may also be less effective in raising investment among firms with minimal profits (for example, small firms and start\u0002ups), where these incentives do not have provisions, such as allowing firms to carry-forward tax benefits, or tax credits to be refunded for firms without a tax liability. Tax measures that favour the accumulation of debt over equity can have negative consequences for financial stability by incentivising excessive debt accumulation and can have adverse implications for investment activity (Égert, 2021; Blundell-Wignall and Roulet, 2013). Incentives to favour debt financing may also inhibit the funding of intangible investments given that the underlying characteristics of these assets (uncertain returns, non-rivalry and low redeploy ability; Demmou and Franco, 2021) pose challenges in providing them as collateral against loans. However, this effect may be offset somewhat in tax systems that allow expensing of intangible investments. 94  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Box 2.3. Corporate income taxation and investment: impact and policy design considerations Corporate income taxation (CIT) is usually considered to be a key policy instrument for influencing business investment decisions. Since the seminal work of Hall and Jorgenson (1967), a large body of empirical research has found a negative relationship between CIT rates and investment (see e.g. Feld and Heckemeyer, 2011; Vartia, 2008; Schwellnus and Arnold 2008; Zwick and Mahon, 2017). Higher CIT rates reduce the after-tax returns on investment, thereby reducing the number of economically viable investment projects. Higher CIT rates also can negatively affect firms' cash flow, which reduces liquidity and can limit investment for firms facing financial constraints. The overall effect of CIT on investment also depends on the design of the CIT system beyond headline rates, including depreciation rules, tax allowances (such as accelerated depreciation), tax credits, CIT exemptions and reduced tax rates. Forward-looking effective tax rates, calculated based on hypothetical investment projects, can help gauge the impact of different design features of the tax system over the lifetime of an investment (Devereux and Griffith, 2003; Hanappi, 2018; González Cabral, Appelt and Hanappi, 2021; Celani, Dressler and Hanappi, 2022). The effective average tax rate (EATR) measures the average tax rate on investment projects earning positive profits or economic rents, while the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) reflects the tax burden on a marginal investment project that just breaks even. Figure 2.26 also shows that these rates vary across sources of finance (and they can also vary according to asset classes, project profitability and firm size), highlighting the distortions in many CIT systems. Figure 2.26. Effective corporate income tax rates vary strongly across assets and source of finance Distribution of statutory versus effective CIT rates across OECD countries, percentage of taxable income, 2023 Note: The distribution (minimum, maximum, median and interquartile range) of CIT rates across OECD countries. It compares statutory tax rates with synthetic tax policy indicators calculated on the basis of a prospective, hypothetical investment project. Unlike backward-looking effective tax rates, they do not incorporate any information about firms' actual tax payments. Further details of the model and assumptions are contained in OECD Corporate Tax Statistics and Hanappi (2018). Source: OECD Corporate Tax Statistics 2024 (OECD, 2024c). StatLink 2https://stat.link/75qr38 The impact of corporate taxation on investment: heterogeneity across firms and tax design Recent research suggests that the potential for corporate tax policy to support business investment varies across firms. Large, profitable multinationals — especially those with significant intangible assets, market power or profit-shifting opportunities — have become less sensitive to corporate tax changes in a single country over time, particularly since the global financial crisis (Hanappi and Whyman, 2023; Hanappi, Millot and Turban, 2023; Zwick and Mahon, 2017). Since a small number of large multinational firms account for a substantial share of total investment, this may reduce the aggregate investment response to tax policy changes.  95 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Moreover, evidence suggests that investment responses vary significantly depending on tax policy design. Increases in effective taxation through non-profit taxes (i.e. business taxes levied on bases other than corporate income, such as real estate or wealth) tend to have a stronger negative effect on investment than CIT. Reforms that affect the tax base, such as expanding capital allowances, can be more effective in supporting investment compared to statutory tax rate (STR) cuts (Hanappi, Millot and Turban, 2023). Studies indeed show increased investment in response to the provision of accelerated depreciation, immediate expensing, enhanced allowances and tax credits (Maffini, Xing and Devereux, 2019; Chodorow-Reich et al., 2024; Ohrn, 2019). However, care should be taken when using these allowances, as a CIT base that is too narrow can undermine revenue and introduce distortions. Reducing the debt bias in the CIT system can also reduce economic distortions and support financial stability (De Mooij and Hebous, 2018; Feld, Heckemeyer and Overesch, 2013). Alongside tax design, tax certainty is an essential condition for fostering business investment. Stable and predictable tax rules, combined with clear dispute resolution mechanisms, can reduce investment risk and support economic growth. In an increasingly globalised tax environment, both national policy choices and international cooperation can play a critical role in ensuring certainty. Enhancing the investment impact of CIT policy: potential options for reform Careful CIT design can enhance investment outcomes. Reforms could include: • Eliminating or reducing non-profit taxes, which tend to distort investment more than profit-based taxes. • Prioritise the use of more generous capital allowances and other tax-base measures, which often lead to stronger investment responses. • Limit tax incentives to areas with clear policy goals and strong governance arrangements, and where clear positive externalities warrant an incentive, such as for R&D or green investments. • Focus on expenditure-based tax incentives over income-based incentives. Support tax certainty through clear and predictable tax rules, clear eligibility criteria for tax incentives, and collaborative and consistent approach to tax administration, including internationally (OECD, 2024d).

An investment accelerator model To help assess the extent to which cyclical fluctuations have contributed to the observed dynamics in business investment since the global financial crisis (GFC) and the pandemic, a reduced-form investment model is estimated. This relates real business investment growth to its own lag as well as to current real output growth. The model is estimated for the 17 OECD countries for which data on real business investment are available. This empirical framework aims to capture the short-term response of investment to output fluctuations, shedding light on the role of demand-side factors in shaping investment patterns over recent cycles. The results are presented in Table 2.A.1. Annex Table 2.A.1.

An extended model is subsequently estimated that incorporates the standard determinants of investment implied by neo-classical frameworks, while also allowing for the role of time-varying capital depreciation rates, real equity prices (which may reflect corporate balance sheet conditions and elements of Tobin’s Q), and capacity utilisation, proxied by the output gap (with a prior that a more negative output gap reduces the need to undertake new investment). The model is estimated using an unbalanced panel comprising 13 OECD economies, with quarterly data from 1993Q1 to 2022Q3, subject to data availability. All variables enter the model in logarithmic form, except for the output gap. In line with Pelgrin et al. (2002), the user cost of capital is introduced as log(1+UCC). Country-specific effects are controlled for using a least squares dummy variable estimator.

Developments in individual OECD and selected non-member economies 104  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Argentina GDP growth is projected to be robust, at 5.2% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026. Private consumption and investment will continue to recover, sustained by higher real disposable incomes, more favourable financing conditions and an improving business environment. The recent removal of capital restrictions will support further improvements in economic sentiment and investment. Inflation will continue to decline, albeit at a slower pace. Amid rising imports, the current account will deteriorate. Monetary policy will need to remain tight to maintain inflation on a firmly downward path. Fiscal policy should build on the recent successful adjustment with more sustainable consolidation measures, to maintain strong fiscal outcomes. This includes phasing out subsidies, and raising public-sector efficiency, while replacing distortionary taxes by broader income and consumption tax bases. Recent efforts to reduce the regulatory burden will boost productivity and should continue, complemented by stronger incentives for the formalisation of workers and firms. A strong economic recovery is underway After a strong contraction in the first half of 2024, activity bounced back to growth of more than 18% in annualised terms in the third quarter and over 5% in the last quarter of 2024. The recovery was driven by private investment, consumption, and exports. Short-term indicators point towards further improvement. Credit to the private sector is recovering. Consumer confidence and business sentiment have improved. Annual inflation has fallen from 211% at the end of 2023 to 47% in April 2025. Unemployment was 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, down from a peak of 7.7% in early 2024. Real wages have already surpassed their October 2023 level. Argentina 1.

New gas production is helping to reduce energy import dependence, and the sector now generates trade surpluses. Exports to the United States account for only about 9% of Argentina’s total exports, or around 1% of GDP, and have not been significantly affected by US tariff increases so far. Argentina’s own import tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers have been reduced in 2024 and further reductions are expected in 2025. Macroeconomic policies have become more restrictive An impressive fiscal adjustment has been achieved, resulting in a headline fiscal surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2024. The government remains committed to achieving a positive primary balance in 2025, consistent with a balanced headline budget. Monetary policy has also helped the ongoing stabilisation by putting an end to excess money creation. The real benchmark interest rate has become positive and is expected to remain so. A new exchange rate regime has been announced, with the exchange rate floating within bands that will widen by 1% per month. A recent agreement with the IMF will provide additional funding and help to rebuild currency reserves. The removal of currency restrictions has improved confidence and investment incentives. The economy is set for a robust recovery, but important challenges still lie ahead The economic recovery is expected to continue, with GDP growth of 5.2% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026, driven by higher private consumption and investment. Private investment will gain further momentum as currency and capital controls have been lifted. Real wages will continue improving as inflation declines, supporting private consumption. Export growth will slow compared to 2024. Exports have been affected by the recent real appreciation of the currency. Imports will continue their strong recovery, sustained by higher purchasing power and lower import barriers. Headline inflation is projected to slowly continue its downward path, falling to 37% in 2025 and 15% in 2026, sustained by lower import costs, balanced public accounts and positive real interest rates. Higher international interest rates could make it more difficult to accumulate international reserves. Higher US tariffs could result in lower export growth, but export prospects in the agricultural and livestock sector could potentially benefit from changing trade patterns. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Argentina Current prices ARS billion GDP at market prices 46 219.1 5.3 -1.6 -1.7 5.2 4.3 Private consumption 29 096.4 9.4 1.0 -4.2 6.2 3.8 Government consumption 7 356.1 3.0 1.5 -3.2 1.6 0.6 Gross fixed capital formation 7 991.6 11.2 -2.0 -17.4 21.7 14.9 Final domestic demand 44 444.1 8.6 0.6 -6.6 7.9 5.2 Stockbuilding¹ 363.1 -0.4 -0.1 -1.9 -0.4 0.0 Total domestic demand 44 807.2 8.3 0.4 -8.5 8.4 6.7 Exports of goods and services 8 350.3 4.6 -7.5 23.2 11.2 6.4 Imports of goods and services 6 938.4 17.8 1.7 -10.6 23.9 14.5 Net exports¹ 1 411.9 -1.8 -1.5 4.4 -1.3 -1.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 69.9 135.4 207.9 51.7 32.7 Consumer price index² _ 72.4 133.5 219.9 36.6 14.9 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -0.5 -3.0 0.9 0.0 -0.8 Percentage changes, volume (2004 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Expanding the personal income tax base could raise revenues in a progressive way and would allow distortionary and inefficient taxes that hinder investment to be reduced. Eliminating VAT exemptions could generate additional revenues. Despite recent progress, trade barriers remain high and lower import barriers on intermediate and capital goods could boost investment and export competitiveness. Regulatory processes have been simplified, but entry barriers in services sectors could be reduced further.  107 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Australia After a period of weak activity, GDP growth will reach 1.8% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026. The strong recent immigration-driven growth in employment and the labour force will subside, leaving unemployment little changed at low levels. Inflation will remain close to target, averaging 2.3% in both 2025 and 2026. Australia has limited direct exposure to US tariff changes but is at risk from any marked slowdown in China, especially via its effect on commodity prices. Monetary policy tightening in 2022-24 squeezed disposable incomes and restrained demand, facilitating a return of inflation to target. The easing that began recently should continue in the coming quarters as long as inflation remains subdued. The main fiscal priorities relate to the longer term, addressing demographic and climate challenges and improving the efficiency of the tax system. A range of policy actions, including easing zoning restrictions, is needed to strengthen competition and productivity, as well as to raise housing investment to reverse the long-standing decline in housing affordability. Public consumption has helped to avoid a hard landing but global trade tensions are hitting sentiment The growth of private domestic demand – especially consumption and housing investment – was weak in 2024, in part reflecting the cumulative effect of the rise in interest rates since 2022. This weakness was, however, largely offset by strong growth in government consumption. Activity indicators for early 2025, including household spending, suggest that the improved but still moderate private consumption growth seen in late 2024 has continued. Both business and consumer sentiment have worsened recently, however, likely reflecting the elevated uncertainty arising from global trade tensions. The disinflation that began in late 2022 has continued, with headline inflation at or below the mid-point of the target range since September 2024, although the central bank’s preferred measure of core inflation remains above target. Disinflation has been achieved with little deterioration in labour market conditions, with employment continuing to grow strongly – driven by high net immigration over the past three years – and unemployment remaining low. The strength of employment was facilitated by subdued wage growth, while vacancies have fallen back to their pre-pandemic trend path. Sluggish external demand for Australia’s main export commodities yielded lower export prices and near\u0002stagnant volumes over the past year. The resulting fall in export receipts contrasted with a 5% increase in imports, pushing the current account deficit up to 1.9% of GDP in 2024. Australia’s exposure to US tariff increases is limited given that exports to the United States represent only about 5% of total exports. The impact of global trade tensions on the Australian economy is more likely to come via the depressing effect of higher tariffs and policy uncertainty on investment worldwide, manifested in part by lower prices for iron ore, coal and natural gas. 108  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Australia 1.

Federal and state budgets for the 2024-25 and 2025-26 fiscal years imply a widening of the general government deficit by 1.3 percentage points of GDP in calendar year 2025, after an increase of 1.9 percentage points in 2024, before the deficit stabilises at just under 4% of GDP in 2026. This would mean an upward drift in the ratio of public debt to GDP, but net debt to GDP would remain modest, reaching only 6.6% in 2026. Growth should be close to potential in 2025-26 barring adverse external shocks Given renewed, if modest, real wage growth and a recovery in real disposable household income as interest rates decline, private consumption growth is expected to pick up this year and next, more than offsetting a slowdown in public consumption growth. Some interest-rate-sensitive investment, such as housing, is expected to rebound in 2025, but other investment will be hindered by elevated global policy uncertainty, leaving overall fixed investment growth little changed from 2024. Final domestic demand growth in 2025 is projected to be around 2%, as in 2024, but with export and import volume growth projected to be similar in 2025, the drag on GDP from net exports seen in 2024 eases, allowing GDP growth to pick up from 1.1% in 2024 to 1.8% in 2025. A further improvement in private consumption and investment in 2026 is projected to push GDP growth up to 2.2% in 2026, roughly in line with potential. The main sources of risk to the projections are external, especially any negative developments relating to import demand in China, by far Australia’s largest export market and the largest consumer of the main Australian export commodities. Policies should be geared to maintaining macroeconomic balance while addressing structural weaknesses The expected continued easing of monetary policy is warranted barring shocks pushing inflation back up and/or causing expectations to become de-anchored, but the difficult external context may demand nimbleness on the central bank’s part. The widening of the fiscal deficit in 2024-25 and the further budgeted increase in 2025-26 are justifiable given the weakness of private demand, but governments should look to save any windfalls relative to current plans. Consolidation is needed over the medium term, given the fiscal pressures on the horizon, including population ageing and costs associated with the transition to net zero. Key structural policy priorities are to address the housing affordability crisis by boosting supply and to accelerate progress toward net zero carbon emissions, especially in transport and industry. The revitalisation of competition policy heralded by two agreements between federal and state governments signed in 2024 should also help to reverse the longstanding decline in trend productivity growth, including by boosting business investment via streamlined regulation at all levels of government. This should be complemented by other policies to strengthen investment, including improved incentives for housebuilding, especially for social housing, and public investment to improve electricity grid connections. 110  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Austria The economy is projected to begin recovering from a prolonged recession, with output declining by 0.3% in 2025, but growing modestly by 1% in 2026. A gradual pickup in household consumption and private investment, supported by lower interest rates and a resilient labour market, will help drive the recovery. Inflation is expected to decline towards 2% by end-2026. Progressive fiscal consolidation may constrain demand growth. A slowdown in activity in Europe or deepening of structural challenges may hold back the recovery, while more persistent wage increases could further impair competitiveness and sustain higher inflation. Fiscal plans should progressively reduce the budget deficit in the years ahead, bringing it below 3% of GDP. Leveraging EU funds would help cushion the impact of a restrictive fiscal policy stance while strengthening economic resilience through the structural adjustment of industries heavily affected by rising energy costs. Increasing labour force participation among women and older workers as planned, along with shifting taxation away from labour, would promote more inclusive growth and support the sustainability of the public finances. Plans to expand broadband should include easing regulations relating to infrastructure deployment alongside innovative policy instruments and incentives. The economy has continued to contract, albeit at a slower pace Economic activity rose by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, signalling a modest recovery after having declined for three consecutive quarters and, in particular, by 0.4% in 2024Q4. Output growth was primarily driven by industrial production (up 0.6%, q-o-q in real terms), services (up 0.8%) and exports (up 1.4%). Inflation rose to 3.3% in April from 3.1% in March.

Weak trade performance in recent years reflects sectoral challenges in key products, such as machinery and vehicles, processed goods, chemical products, and other manufactured goods. While direct exposure to increases in US tariffs on EU goods is modest, there are indirect effects through weaker demand in European markets as a whole, notably Germany. Gas and electricity connections to other European countries are being upgraded rapidly, which will improve energy security and may help to lower prices, including for energy-intensive sectors. Fiscal consolidation is planned In 2024, the budget deficit reached an unexpectedly high level of 4.7% of GDP, driven by higher-than\u0002expected wage increases and spending at sub-federal level, and breached the 3% of GDP threshold of the EU rules. The new government has introduced a seven-year budget consolidation plan. In the short run, spending cuts are scheduled to amount to approximately EUR 6.3 billion in 2025 (1.3% of GDP) and EUR 8.7 billion in 2026 (1.9% of GDP). The spending reductions are primarily targeted at reducing pensions, family support and environmental subsidies and implementing across-the-board cuts in all ministerial departments. The plans also incorporate targeted tax increases on banks, tobacco products, gambling, real estate transactions and foundations, but tax relief for SMEs, as well as incentives for additional performance and investments in social welfare and economic growth. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Austria Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices* 406.1 5.4 -0.9 -1.3 -0.3 1.0 Private consumption 201.3 5.2 -0.3 0.1 0.6 1.4 Government consumption 88.6 -0.5 1.2 1.6 1.4 1.0 Gross fixed capital formation 105.5 0.3 -3.1 -3.6 0.0 1.5 Final domestic demand 395.4 2.6 -0.7 -0.5 0.6 1.3 Stockbuilding¹ 6.6 1.3 -3.0 -1.0 0.3 0.0 Total domestic demand 402.0 3.9 -3.7 -1.5 1.0 1.4 Exports of goods and services 227.7 10.1 -0.5 -4.3 -0.9 2.0 Imports of goods and services 223.7 7.1 -4.5 -5.0 0.7 1.6 Net exports¹ 4.0 1.7 2.5 0.3 -0.9 0.3 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 4.8 6.6 3.0 2.5 2.2 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 8.6 7.7 2.9 3.0 1.9 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 5.1 7.3 3.9 2.9 2.2 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 4.7 5.1 5.2 5.2 5.2 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 8.8 8.7 11.7 12.3 12.9 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -3.4 -2.6 -4.7 -4.4 -4.2 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 85.1 87.0 90.1 93.0 94.9 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 78.3 78.4 81.8 84.7 86.6 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -0.9 1.3 2.4 1.8 1.5 Percentage changes, volume (2015 prices) * Based on seasonal and working-day adjusted quarterly data; may differ from official non-working-day adjusted annual data.

Household consumption is expected to rebound gradually as real wages continue rising following previous inflation adjustments. With falling interest rates, private investment should begin to recover in the second half of 2025, although at a subdued pace given uncertainty and structural challenges. Trade growth will be relatively modest given wider regional developments, but will be supported in 2026 by higher government spending in Germany. Inflation is expected to decline steadily over the remainder of 2025 and 2026. Risks to these projections are skewed to the downside. Heightened trade tensions affecting Germany and an extended crisis in the automotive and other industrial sectors could further undermine economic prospects. More persistent wage increases could further hamper competitiveness. The fiscal consolidation plan may exert a stronger-than-expected dampening effect on economic activity, potentially resulting in a prolonged period of sluggish growth. Fiscal consolidation is needed and structural reforms would help sustain the recovery The medium-term consolidation strategy aims to reduce the fiscal deficit gradually until 2031 but phasing it in more progressively in the initial two years would limit the near-term impact on economic growth. Sustaining the consolidation path will be challenging given that population aging is projected to add fiscal pressure of around 2% of GDP by 2030, on top of rising interest payments and climate and defence spending. Reforms aimed at reducing regulatory barriers such as cutting red tape and lowering entry barriers in targeted sectors, in particular, professional services, would boost competitiveness and business investment. Similarly, addressing regulatory bottlenecks in housing, by easing land-use regulations, could improve housing supply and stimulate construction investment. Accelerating public investment plans to expand communications networks and high-speed connectivity, and easing related regulatory constraints, would foster digitalization and support long-term economic growth. Policies to increase female labour market participation – such as the planned expansion in child and long-term care facilities – and measures to raise the effective retirement age would help mitigate the impact of a declining working-age population.  113 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Belgium Economic activity is projected to continue to expand at a modest pace, with GDP growth stable at 1.0% in 2025 and 2026. Household consumption remains the primary driver of economic activity but is expected to slow as real income growth moderates. Investment is set to decelerate following robust growth in 2023 and 2024, primarily due to heightened uncertainty surrounding international trade developments. Export growth continues to be subdued, reflecting weakening competitiveness and sluggish external demand. Disinflation is expected to continue, pushing inflation below 2% in 2026. The fiscal deficit remains substantial, and meaningful fiscal consolidation efforts will only resume in 2026, leaving Belgium unlikely to meet European Union fiscal targets for both 2025 and 2026. The existing tax structure disproportionately relies on labour taxes, negatively affecting employment. Implementing comprehensive tax reforms to broaden the tax base, reduce distortions, and address disincentives to work could significantly enhance potential economic growth. Additionally, reducing administrative burdens, particularly for small businesses, could further stimulate investment. Growth has moderated Private consumption strengthened during the second half of 2024, buoyed by robust real disposable income growth in preceding years, but slowed markedly at the beginning of 2025. Public consumption followed a similar pattern. Other growth drivers have been less dynamic. Private investment has been weak, constrained by sluggish exports and subdued residential construction, although both rebounded in early 2025, pushing quarterly GDP growth to 0.4% (non-annualised) in the first quarter of 2025. Export performance has been consistently poor, resulting in the current account returning to a deficit. Changes in US tariff policies and the uncertain international environment have led to sharp falls in business and investor confidence since the end of 2024. Although the labour market remained resilient into early 2025, employment growth slowed significantly compared to previous years. Disinflation trends have persisted, with core inflation easing to 2.3% in April 2025. Headline inflation also declined to just above 3%, down from over 5% in the summer of 2024, driven in part by base effects from earlier increases in tobacco and energy prices. 114  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Belgium 1.

While its direct bilateral trade exposure to the new US tariffs on EU goods is limited – with exports to the United States primarily exempt goods like pharmaceuticals and chemicals – its exports would suffer from an ensuing slowdown of its main European partners. Fiscal consolidation is slow Automatic indexation bolstered household purchasing power during the post-pandemic inflation surge but also exacerbated fiscal deficits and weakened competitiveness. The transition to a new government has contributed to further delays in advancing fiscal consolidation efforts. Despite an anticipated reduction in the structural primary deficit to 2.4% of potential GDP by 2026 (down from 3.2% in 2024), achieving the EU fiscal targets will likely remain unattainable. The overall fiscal deficit is expected to deteriorate further in 2025 before slightly decreasing to 4.5% in 2026, the same level as in 2024. Rising uncertainty will weigh on growth prospects Economic growth is expected to remain below potential. The investment recovery will continue to face headwinds from elevated global trade uncertainty, although residential investment is expected to improve gradually from low levels. Wage growth moderation aimed at restoring competitiveness will result in slower private consumption growth. Export activity will remain weak due to softer external demand, keeping the current account broadly balanced. Consumer prices are expected to decelerate, with core inflation falling below 2% in both 2025 and 2026. Increased European defence expenditures, notably from Germany, may provide a modest boost to exports. Conversely, Belgium might face increased import penetration from China, a risk further aggravated by recent losses in competitiveness. Bold reforms are needed to address domestic challenges Effective fiscal consolidation should prioritise enhancing spending efficiency in healthcare and pension systems alongside comprehensive tax reform to shift taxation away from labour towards broader, less distortionary bases. A credible medium-term fiscal strategy featuring multiannual budgeting frameworks and binding expenditure rules at federal and regional levels is essential. Labour market policies should progressively phase out work disincentives and incentivise prolonged employment. Long-term economic growth would benefit significantly from regulatory simplification and expanded access to lifelong learning. Achieving climate objectives will require stronger incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments. Reducing administrative burdens on small and innovative businesses would further support investment and economic dynamism. 116  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Brazil Real GDP is projected to expand by 2.1% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. Household consumption will continue to be the principal driver of growth, even if slowing, bolstered by robust wage increases. Private investment experienced a marked pickup in 2024 and is expected to remain buoyant despite easing gradually. Export momentum is projected to improve modestly, albeit against a backdrop of significant exposure to demand from China. Inflation is projected to remain above the 3% target throughout both 2025 and 2026, driven predominantly by the services sector. Fiscal policy is expected to remain slightly expansionary in 2025. A proposed income tax reform, designed to be tax-neutral, is unlikely to generate additional fiscal space to accommodate rising spending pressures. Social expenditures are set to continue to rise, putting further pressure on the public finances. A tight monetary policy stance is projected to continue for some time. Lowering market entry and exit barriers, easing regulations, boosting infrastructure investments and fostering competition have significant potential to boost productivity and growth. Economic activity is slowing down Despite robust GDP growth of 3.4% in 2024, early signs of an economic slowdown emerged toward the end of the year. Domestic demand weakened, driven by a decline in household consumption coupled with lower investment, as heightened uncertainty, rising policy rates, and persistent inflation undermined both business and consumer confidence. Industrial production remains subdued, but after five consecutive months of stagnation, it grew by 1.2% in March. Retail sales have moderated after a 4.7% annual increase in 2024. Conversely, the services sector maintained its strong momentum in early 2025, propelled by the information and communications sector. In agriculture, the 2025 harvest is projected to be much stronger than in 2024, which was affected by a drought. Although unemployment edged up slightly to 6.8% in February from its historic low in November, the labour market remains resilient, as evidenced by record\u0002high formal-sector employment and earnings.

This tightening is intended to address price pressures from a positive output gap, a tight labour market with robust wage growth, an ongoing fiscal expansion, and a depreciating currency, all of which are driving inflation expectations higher. Despite heightened policy uncertainty, the projections include further rate increases, bringing the policy rate to 15% towards the end of 2025, before a gradual reduction to 12% by the end of 2026 as inflationary pressures ease. Fiscal policy is expected to remain modestly expansionary, posing challenges for meeting the primary balance target. Under the current fiscal rule, the government is required to achieve a balanced primary budget in 2025 and a primary surplus of 0.25% of GDP in 2026. However, persistent spending pressures from social benefits and strict minimum spending requirements for healthcare and education, pose significant challenges for meeting these targets. Moreover, slower economic activity is likely to constrain government revenue growth. This financing gap may end up being bridged by one-off measures, such as increased dividend and royalty receipts, or by broad-based expenditure freezes. Additionally, interest payments, currently estimated at around 8% of GDP, will continue to follow rising interest rates, increasing the growth of gross public debt. Growth is set to ease Economic growth is projected to ease from 3.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025, and 1.6% in 2026. The moderation is largely driven by a slowdown in domestic demand. Household consumption is expected to soften as higher inflation and weaker consumer confidence take their toll. After a strong rebound in 2024, private investment will likely become weaker over 2025 and 2026 due to softening external demand and the impact of higher interest rates. On the supply side, the manufacturing sector faces challenges from rising tariffs in the United States, which remains the primary destination for Brazilian manufacturing exports. Annual inflation is forecast at 5.7% in 2025 before easing slightly to 5.0% in 2026. This reflects quarterly inflation gradually converging toward the target, reaching around 4% in the final quarter of 2026, although intermittent upticks from trade and tariff shocks remain possible. The projections are subject to several risks. Fiscal slippage could dampen investment and erode confidence. Inflation risks are slightly tilted to the upside as persistent financial market tensions and further currency depreciation could intensify price pressures. Moreover, any additional deterioration of confidence in the fiscal outlook would likely extend the current episode of unanchored inflation expectations and require higher interest rates for longer, further undermining the economic outlook. Consolidating public spending while expanding infrastructure investment Fiscal consolidation is essential to put public debt on a declining trajectory. Reforming automatic spending rules, particularly those concerning education and healthcare, would allow greater flexibility to address priority challenges, and adjusting the indexation formula for public pensions and social benefits would reduce the burden of these benefits on the public finances. Stringent regulations and high administrative burdens on goods and services markets hinder competition and hamper the entry of new firms, thus dampening productivity growth and investment. Although recent measures have trimmed unnecessary bureaucracy, further reductions in regulatory burdens and licensing requirements remain critical. Easing entry restrictions in professional services, including abolishing exclusive rights for certain ancillary tasks, could reduce the cost of doing business, thereby boosting competition and enhancing productivity. Moreover, enhanced access to foreign markets and deeper integration into global value chains can be achieved by lowering existing trade barriers. Public spending on infrastructure could become more effective by addressing shortcomings in planning and project execution, as more than 30% of public  119 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 infrastructure projects are interrupted either temporarily or permanently. Expanding technical assistance to subnational governments, which frequently face capacity constraints for infrastructure project preparation and procurement, would significantly enhance the planning and delivery of such investments. Finally, unlocking additional private financing sources is crucial for bridging infrastructure gaps in the medium term. A comprehensive reassessment of current risk-sharing mechanisms and a concerted effort to minimise policy risks and judicial uncertainty could improve the framework conditions for private infrastructure investments. 120  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Bulgaria GDP is expected to increase by 2.6% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026 driven by household consumption growth, supported by ongoing high income and credit growth, and higher government investment with the rollout of EU funds. Exports will grow slowly reflecting weaker growth in other EU economies. Headline inflation has been rising and wage pressures remain elevated. Sustained wage growth risks hindering the moderation of inflation. Interest rates have followed those in the euro area, under the currency board, but transmission to the Bulgarian economy is slow and incomplete, contributing to a household credit boom. Further macroprudential measures should be deployed. Bulgaria has requested an assessment of its readiness to join the euro area, which is assumed to occur in January 2026. The fiscal deficit is set to remain consistent with the 3% of GDP threshold. A more business-friendly administrative environment would help to boost investment, while more effective activation policies and measures to tackle informality would help to make better use of Bulgaria’s labour force. Growth has been driven by consumption GDP increased by 2.8% in 2024 with strong household consumption driven by wage increases, credit growth and higher government transfers. Both public and private investment have been weak due to political uncertainty and low absorption and delay of EU funds. Industrial activity fell below its pre-pandemic levels in the first three months of 2025 reflecting continued declines in mining and energy production. Manufacturing output continued its downward trend, though it remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels. Services and construction activity also remained above pre-pandemic levels. Overall, in the first quarter of 2025, GDP increased by 0.6% (non-annualised). Annual headline inflation increased to 3.5% in April 2025 from 2.4% in April 2024. Unemployment has been declining in tandem with the pick-up in economic activity. Bulgaria Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database.

Imports recovered more than expected in 2024, supported by domestic consumption, and outpaced exports, weighing on the current account balance. Recent changes in global trade policies and higher US tariffs on imports of goods from the EU will have a modest impact on trade, GDP growth and inflation, largely through spillover effects from weaker EU demand as direct trade linkages with the United States are weak. Interest rates will stay low, while the budget deficit will remain at 3% of GDP Interest rate developments will continue to broadly follow euro area monetary policy given the currency board regime. However, transmission of monetary policy to domestic deposit and lending rates has been slow and incomplete due to high liquidity and stiff competition in the banking sector, leading to lending rates that are below euro area norms and strong domestic credit growth. Bulgaria requested a convergence report assessing its readiness for euro adoption in January 2026. Fiscal policy is set to meet the 3% of GDP EU ceiling for the budget deficit. The government may need to make spending adjustments relative to the budget if efforts to boost VAT revenue collection fall short, given planned strong spending in public sector salaries, minimum wages, pensions and social benefits. GDP growth will remain relatively strong Growth is projected to remain strong at 2.6% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026. Private consumption will continue to be boosted by low unemployment, ongoing positive gains in real incomes and domestic credit growth.

Export growth will be more subdued due to challenges in key export markets, while imports will be strong, driven by consumption and investment growth, increasing the current account deficit. Inflation is set to increase to 3.8% in 2025, following strong readings at the beginning of 2025 due to higher food prices, excise and VAT rates as well as household utility prices. Higher minimum wages coupled with persistent labour shortages will keep wage pressures elevated. Strong wage growth due to minimum wage and pensions indexation mechanisms risks high and persistent inflation while lower revenue collection relative to budget expectations risks widening the budget deficit. More prudent fiscal policy and a business-friendly investment climate are needed A modest fiscal consolidation is warranted to help moderate domestic demand and price pressures, and manage long-term spending pressures from ageing, climate and security needs. Reforming the current minimum wage and pension indexation mechanisms to slow the pace of growth in labour costs and government spending would support price stability. A more business-friendly investment climate with lower cost of doing business and reducing perceptions of corruption would attract more capital, domestic and foreign. Bringing more people into the workforce, alongside improvements in labour quality, would strengthen investor confidence in the availability of skilled workers and the effective utilisation of their investment. Improving digital and road infrastructure would enhance the prospective return on investment.  123 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Canada GDP growth is projected to weaken from 1.5% in 2024 to 1.0% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026 due to trade tensions with the United States. Exports and business investment are expected to decline in 2025, while deteriorating employment prospects are expected to weigh on household consumption. Headline inflation will rise slightly, as the impact of higher tariffs on consumer prices is partially offset by lower energy prices due to the removal of the fuel charge. Core inflation will increase for a period before falling back towards 2% next year. Uncertainty about tariff levels and the impact on the Canadian economy remains high. The Bank of Canada has reduced interest rates to 2.75%, with further modest cuts expected this year. However, inflationary pressures from higher tariffs will require a more cautious approach to lowering interest rates. Increased government spending, particularly on housing affordability and new social programmes, has recently worsened the general government balance, although it had previously been in surplus. A key policy priority remains the need to enhance Canada’s weak productivity performance by removing internal barriers to trade and labour mobility, and by strengthening investment and innovation. GDP growth was robust in early 2025, but the outlook has deteriorated Real GDP grew robustly by 0.6% in the last quarter of 2024. Private consumption benefited from the temporary reductions in the goods and services tax (GST) and harmonised sales tax (HST) on qualifying goods. Housing investment continued to recover, and business investment rebounded after a previous quarterly decline. Leading indicators show that economic momentum continued into early 2025, with GDP growing by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2025 according to the flash estimate. However, the outlook has worsened since then due to rising trade tensions with the United States. Business and consumer sentiment have deteriorated, and policy uncertainty has increased. The labour market showed renewed signs of weakening in April, with the unemployment rate rising to 6.9%. Consumer price inflation eased to 1.7% in April, down from 2.3% in March, driven by lower energy prices following the removal of the federal fuel charge and the decline in oil prices. Core inflation increased to 2.6% in April, after 2.4% in March. Since February 2025, trade tensions and increased tariffs on imports to the United States heavily weigh on Canada’s external perspectives, given the interlinkages of the two economies. The heightened uncertainty about tariff levels also burdens long-term spending and investment decisions. For Canada, the tariffs include a 25% tariff on goods and a 10% tariff on energy and potash for imports into the United States that do not fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The projections assume that about 50% of imports do not fall under the agreement. Additionally, they incorporate the 25% tariff rate on steel and aluminium products and the 25% tariff rate on non-US content in USMCA-compliant automobiles. They also account for the counter measures announced by the Canadian government. The broader rise in US tariffs will also dampen external demand. The increased volatility of financial conditions will also adversely impact the near-term outlook. 124  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Canada 1 Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and S&P Global.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/5obnjx Monetary policy has eased, and fiscal policy will be supportive in 2025 The Bank of Canada began to lower interest rates in June 2024, with a total decline of 225 basis points as of mid-April 2025, bringing the policy rate to 2.75%. The projection includes a further 50 basis point reduction in the rate during 2025. The central bank will need to carefully balance the opposing impacts on inflation from tariffs: upward pressure from higher import prices and downward pressure from lower demand. Quantitative tightening, i.e. net asset sales, ended in March. The transmission of lower policy rates to lending rates has progressed, and its impact on the real economy is expected to become more apparent in 2026, as other uncertainty factors wane. The general government budget balance has shifted from a small surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 2023 to a deficit of 2.1% of GDP in 2024, driven by a one-off compensation payment of about 0.7% of GDP, higher interest payments and increased discretionary spending, particularly on new social programmes and affordable housing. The headline deficit is set to improve in 2025, while the underlying primary balance will slightly weaken. The removal of the federal fuel charge on April 1 will have a broadly neutral budgetary impact, as its revenues were principally recycled back to households and businesses through the \"Canada Carbon Rebate”. For 2026, a further improvement in the headline balance is assumed, helped by mild fiscal tightening. GDP growth is expected to slow due to trade tensions After still robust GDP growth in the first quarter of 2025, GDP growth is expected to drop in the second quarter due to sharply falling exports to the United States due to higher tariffs. Household consumption and business investment will also be affected negatively by trade disruptions and high uncertainty. Housing investment is anticipated to remain broadly flat in the first half of 2025, weighed down by elevated uncertainty. Imports are expected to decline less than exports, resulting in a negative net export contribution to GDP growth in 2025. Labour market conditions will further deteriorate in 2025. In 2026, GDP is projected to slowly recover as the economy adjusts to the new tariff environment. Lower interest rates will support business investment and household consumption as uncertainty declines. However, 126  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 slower population growth will moderate aggregate consumption growth. Consumer price inflation is expected to be pushed upwards by higher tariffs, which will increase import prices. However, starting April 1, this will be partly counterbalanced by lower energy prices resulting from the removal of the federal fuel charge. Core inflation is anticipated to increase more sharply in 2025 before gradually declining in the course of 2026. Substantial risks remain, reflecting the highly uncertain situation. Externally, there are risks regarding additional tariffs on Canadian imports to the United States and the potential lifting of the USMCA exemption. Conversely, tariff reductions for Canada could improve economic prospects. US tariffs on other countries could rise or remain at their current levels after the current 90-day suspension period, affecting external demand. There is also significant uncertainty regarding how tariffs will pass through to the Canadian economy, given the magnitude of the tariffs and the strong interconnectedness of North American supply chains. Domestically, new reform measures by the incoming government present upside risks to GDP, while stronger-than-anticipated spillover effects from trade tensions to domestic financial conditions could pose downside risks. Reforms could strengthen productivity and internal markets Trade tensions have highlighted Canada's dependence on the US economy. While the United States remains an important trading partner, Canada should continue to diversify its export markets. Furthermore, Canada can enhance its productivity performance and strengthen internal markets. High regulatory barriers on interprovincial trade should be reduced by expanding the scope of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement. A Canada-wide recognition of foreign credentials could improve labour mobility for immigrants. There is also room to strengthen innovation and competition. Existing R&D tax incentives should be streamlined for both smaller and larger companies and include more direct support. The competitive environment for digital and telecommunication businesses could be further strengthened. The government could also increase investment in infrastructure. Finally, the removal of the federal fuel charge will necessitate a reassessment of Canada’s carbon emissions reduction strategy.  127 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Chile Output is projected to grow by 2.4% in 2025 and in 2026. Household consumption will benefit from rising real wages and job creation, while investment will be supported by reduced credit costs and improved business confidence. Export growth is projected to remain solid, despite ongoing global trade uncertainties. A broader expansion of global tariffs could affect Chile’s exports. Inflation is projected to gradually fall to 3.3% in 2026. Monetary policy is expected to gradually converge to a neutral stance as inflation stays on a declining path. Fiscal policy will remain prudent, guided by the fiscal rule, and focused on keeping debt sustainable while supporting targeted investment and social spending. Advancing structural reforms to simplify regulations, improve permit procedures, and boost skills and innovation will be essential to lift investment and productivity growth. Growth remains resilient despite global risks Activity has strengthened since mid-2024, with annual seasonally adjusted GDP growth reaching 2.4% in the first quarter of 2025. The March monthly economic indicator points to continued expansion and an upward revision in growth in early 2025, driven mainly by non-mining components. Industrial output is recovering, helped by solid external demand and recovering business sentiment. Headline inflation has edged up recently, to 4.5% in April, reflecting the adjustment of electricity tariffs after a multi-year freeze, to align prices more closely with actual generation and distribution costs, and higher energy costs. Core inflation, however, has continued its downward trend, falling steadily to 3.7% in April 2025. The impact of the rise in energy prices on inflation is expected to be temporary. Two-year ahead inflation expectations remain firmly anchored around the central bank’s 3% target. Real wages are rising again and employment is growing, although the pace of job creation remains uneven across sectors. Chile 1. Consumer price index excluding energy and food.

China’s improved outlook has sustained demand for Chilean commodities, reinforcing export revenues. Tourism inflows have recovered, benefiting retail and services. However, global uncertainty has intensified due to new tariff increases in the United States, Chile’s second-largest trading partner. The United States accounts for just 16% of Chilean exports of goods, with 45% of those shipments – including copper, other minerals, and wood products – currently exempt from US tariffs. Monetary policy will be broadly neutral alongside fiscal consolidation The monetary policy stance is expected to converge towards the estimated neutral rate of 4%, following a pause in the easing cycle, and the output gap is narrow. Gradual rate cuts are expected in 2025 by the central bank, with policy rates falling to 4¼ per cent in the latter half of 2026. On the fiscal side, policy is assumed to remain prudent in 2025 and 2026, in line with the government’s commitment to the fiscal rule. The government announced additional fiscal consolidation measures in the first quarter of 2025, totalling about 0.6% of GDP, mainly through administrative spending cuts. The primary balance is projected to improve gradually, with debt stabilising over the projection period. Revenue raising measures including a new mining royalty are set to support revenues and help finance key programmes over the projection period.

Rising trade tensions, particularly involving the US and China, are expected to weaken growth in key export markets. Headline inflation is set to converge to 3% by the end of 2026, reflecting waning supply shocks, anchored expectations and contained wage pressures. Core inflation will continue declining, helped by prudent monetary policy and a stable exchange rate. Volatile energy and commodity prices and weather-related disruptions may cause temporary inflation fluctuations. Risks to the outlook include a sharper slowdown in global demand for copper, potentially triggered by weaker activity in China. Global uncertainty, if prolonged, could weigh on sentiment and investment. On the upside, faster progress in large mining projects and stronger household real wage growth may boost domestic demand more than expected. While financial spillovers remain contained for now, increased global market volatility could tighten financing conditions. Streamlined regulation would improve the investment climate Ensuring macroeconomic stability and public debt sustainability requires balancing fiscal consolidation with efforts to boost long-term growth. In addition to prudent budget management, continued progress in reducing regulatory barriers and fostering competition is essential, including through simplified procedures that lower entry barriers for new firms across sectors. Advancing the permit reform, currently underway, will simplify, standardise and speed up the issuance of multiple sectoral permits to boost investment while maintaining environmental safeguards. Promoting green and resilient infrastructure requires significant investment while fostering innovation, particularly in clean technologies. 130  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 China Economic growth will slow to 4.7% in 2025 and weaken further in 2026 to 4.3%.

Investment in the real estate sector will continue to contract, but business investment will be buttressed in 2025 by the trade-in programme for enterprises. Infrastructure investment will be stable. Exports will be curbed by the newly imposed tariffs on trade with the United States, while imports will fall due to continued localisation of production. Consumer price inflation will remain low, and producer prices will continue to fall. Fiscal policy will become more supportive with a sizeable stimulus approved to finance the trade-in programme and social transfers, unprecedented in recent decades. Some major state-owned banks will be recapitalised to enable them to expand lending. Monetary policy will provide liquidity as needed. Easing prudential measures surrounding mortgage lending will support housing demand. Liberalisation in several services, including healthcare and childcare, and reforms to wage setting mechanisms to support higher wages will boost efficiency and potentially consumption. The social security system should be revamped to reduce precautionary savings and support consumption in a sustainable manner. Administrative monopolies as well as illegal fees should be abolished to unleash private sector potential. Growth has been stable despite the trade conflict Annual growth was broadly stable at 5.4% in the first quarter of 2025. Consumption has been supported by the expansion of the trade-in programme, now including smartphones in addition to home electronics. Manufacturing investment has remained stable, supported by strong industrial production, and infrastructure growth has been strong. Investment in real estate, however, continues to fall, as excess supply needs to be worked off. Declining food prices have kept inflation below zero. The producer price index has continued to fall.

The tariffs will disproportionately affect private companies, including foreign ones, as they are the major exporters. While exports have been boosted by front-loading since late 2024, imports have fallen. China’s retaliatory tariffs will affect imports from the United States. New and existing external restrictions on trade in specific products and investment will further impede Chinese trade with the United States and contribute to risks of supply-chain disruption in the longer term.

The headline fiscal balance is the official balance defined as the difference between revenues and outlays. Revenues include: general budget revenue, revenue from the central stabilisation fund and sub-national budget adjustment. Outlays include: general budget spending, replenishment of the central stabilisation fund and repayment of principal on sub-national debt. 132  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Fiscal stimulus is being stepped up and monetary policy remains supportive Fiscal policy has become more supportive in 2025 with the official budget deficit (which is the deficit on the major budget account out of the four accounts) planned to increase by one percentage point of GDP this year, a move unseen in the recent decade. Spending on social policies and transfers will increase, including on public health services, subsidies for citizen health insurance, raising the minimum citizen pension, child subsidies and making childcare services available countrywide. These policies, alongside the extension and expansion of the trade-in programme to include smartphones in addition to home appliances, will mostly benefit low-income groups, who have a higher propensity to consume. In addition, liberalisation of health, elderly care, childcare and household services will support consumption. A new wage-setting mechanism will help raise annual wage growth. Use by local governments of special bonds will be more flexible, boosting infrastructure spending. The debt burden of heavily indebted local governments is being alleviated and some consumption taxes are being assigned to the local level, although the core imbalance between revenue assignments and spending responsibilities at sub-national government levels has yet to be addressed, and local governments continue to face financial pressure from lower real estate prices. Fiscal policy is assumed to be broadly neutral in 2026. Monetary policy rates will remain low, and the authorities are ready to lower them or the reserve requirement ratio further if needed. There was a 10 basis point cut in the loan prime rates, the seven-day reverse repo rate and the interest rates for the standing lending facility as well as a 50 basis point cut in the reserve requirement ratio in May. Banks have started a new round of deposit rate cuts. Special treasury bonds are being issued to recapitalise some of the major state-controlled banks so that they can step up their lending to support the private sector. Prudential easing measures adopted in late 2024 will continue to support housing demand, including for second-hand housing. Growth will be held back by higher trade barriers Growth is expected to slow in 2025 and weaken further in 2026 due to higher trade barriers and the continuing adjustment in the real estate sector. The higher level of tariffs on trade with the United States will contribute to lower exports and imports, with the impact in 2025 mitigated by the front-loading of trade. The impact on trade will further be mitigated by lower administrative burdens on firms, the full VAT refund on exports, the critical nature of some trade and through increased trade to other markets. However, it will be dampened by weaker demand in China’s export markets due to higher uncertainty. Consumption will be supported by higher incomes and increased social spending. Inflation will remain low, despite a small boost form higher import prices. Risks to growth are tilted to the downside. While an easing of trade restrictions between China and the United States would improve the outlook, any further increase of trade restrictions internationally or a slowdown in other economies would slow export growth and industrial activity. The small boost to social transfers cannot replace social security reforms and may keep uncertainty and precautionary savings high. Potential further credit events may disrupt the orderly adjustment process in the real estate sector. Excessive relaxation of demand-side restrictions in the property sector could result in stronger growth, but also in a further build-up of imbalances and sharper adjustment in the future. Delaying addressing the funding gap at sub-national government levels may lead to further accumulation of implicit debt and costly resolution later. Fiscal expansion coupled with more stringent measures to raise spending efficiency may lift the impact of the spending and result in higher growth. Excessive subsidies to import-dependent high\u0002technology sectors that face high tariffs and other restrictions could temporarily boost those industries but would waste scarce fiscal resources and potentially lead to excess capacity. Reducing the mortgage burden and targeting low-income groups with transfers may result in somewhat higher consumption.  133 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Structural reforms could hold up growth in the medium term While China’s potential growth is slowing due to population ageing, there is ample room for structural reforms to keep growth at a reasonably strong level in the medium term. At the current juncture, a range of measures are being explored to mitigate the impact of US tariffs: VAT refund on exports, tariff cuts on other countries and lowering the administrative burden on enterprises and abolishing illegal fees, as there is little room to cut profit margins due to cut-throat competition in many manufacturing industries. In services, where markups are much higher, strengthening the Fair Competition Review Mechanism and abolishing local protectionism should be pursued. New social transfers will boost consumption, but bolder social security reforms are needed. Unemployment insurance coverage needs to be extended to all, and pensions should provide at least a minimum standard of living to all eligible people. Furthermore, the list of treatments and medicines covered by health insurance needs to be widened so that health costs do not push people into poverty. 134  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Colombia Growth will recover to 2.5% this year and 2.6% in 2026. Investment will continue growing as it recovers from a historical fall and as financial conditions ease, though uncertainty and a weak housing market will keep it subdued. Consumption and exports will moderate due to US tariffs and a global economic slowdown. The decline in inflation, temporarily interrupted in early 2025, will resume but inflation will stay above the 3% target throughout 2026. Monetary policy should continue its data-dependent, prudent easing cycle to ensure durable disinflation towards target. The fiscal deficit is projected to remain high in 2025 and 2026, requiring additional fiscal consolidation to abide by fiscal rules, debt stabilisation, and a reduction of high debt servicing costs due to large risk premia. In the medium term, reducing budget rigidities and a comprehensive tax reform are needed to rebuild fiscal space. Easing administrative burdens and improving infrastructure would help revitalise productivity and investment growth. Growth sustains its momentum In 2024, growth averaged 1.6% year-on-year but picked up to 3.7% (saar) in the final quarter. This momentum was largely sustained in the first quarter of 2025. Investment continued to recover from its sharp fall in 2023 and remained a main driver of growth. Soft indicators give mixed messages, with business sentiment fluctuating around its slightly upward 12-month trend but consumer sentiment softening since February. The labour market remains strong, with unemployment at 9.1% in March. Inflation has hovered around 5.2% since November, although core inflation continued to fall. With a slower-than\u0002expected path of disinflation, inflation expectations for end-2025 have increased, from 3.9% in October to 4.8% in May. Colombia 1.

Colombia has maintained its tariffs from the bilateral free trade agreement with the United States. The peso depreciated strongly (around 5%) in April but largely recovered in May. Lower oil prices will suppress exports and budget revenues, increasing pressures on an already tight fiscal position. Fiscal deficits and monetary policy rates will remain higher for longer The fiscal position has deteriorated sharply in 2024, with a 6.8% headline deficit and a 2.4% primary deficit. Deficits are projected to stay high at 6% in 2025 and 5.6% in 2026 based on current spending plans and medium-term revenues estimates. The government assumes a short-term increase in tax revenue of 2.4% of GDP from unidentified measures. Unless there is evidence that tax collection significantly exceeds its current level, spending cuts of at least 0.9% of GDP are needed to comply with the fiscal rule in 2025. The central bank paused its monetary easing cycle in the first quarter when inflation stabilised but resumed it with a 25 basis points cut in April. With a continuation of the cautious, data-dependent easing cycle, the policy rate is projected to decline to 7% by the end of 2026. Growth will be moderate, but with increasing downside risks The economy will grow at moderate rates of 2.5% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026. Investment will continue its recovery from a fall to below 17% of GDP, but uncertainty and a housing market downturn will prevent a full return to the pre-pandemic investment rate of 21%. Uncertainty will similarly subdue private consumption in 2025. With growth close to potential, unemployment will stay around its current level.

Inflation will gradually slow to 4.5% year-on-year by late 2025 and 3.8% by the end of 2026. Strong remittances and reinvested profits will keep the current account deficit contained. Risks are tilted to the downside. Uncertainty has already put downward pressure on the exchange rate in recent weeks, which could intensify, adding to inflationary pressures. Larger fiscal deficits and a failure to comply with the fiscal rule would further increase risk premia and already high sovereign interest payments and dampen investor confidence. Fiscal discipline would help mitigate uncertainty Cuts to planned expenditure are required to intensify fiscal consolidation, comply with the fiscal rule, and ensure debt sustainability. Diesel subsidies could be removed, following earlier commendable measures for petrol, and social spending could be better targeted. Spending reviews could help identify further room for raising spending efficiency. A comprehensive tax reform, involving reductions in tax expenditures, a shift from corporate to personal income taxes, tackling tax evasion, and reducing budget rigidities, would also help increase fiscal space. Measures to restore investment and revitalise productivity growth include lowering administrative burdens on businesses, improving transport infrastructure, building subnational government capacities, and strengthening macroeconomic governance, transparency, and policy certainty.  137 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Costa Rica GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025 and 2026, after 4.3% in 2024. Domestic demand will drive growth, while external demand will deteriorate following the introduction of a 10% tariff on Costa Rican goods exports to the United States, its main trading partner. Private consumption will remain solid due to incremental increases in disposable income and employment creation. Inflation is gradually rising towards the 3% target and will reach 1.8% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026, as the gradual improvement in domestic conditions leads to a slow increase in domestic inflationary pressures. The fiscal situation has improved but ensuring fiscal sustainability requires the strict implementation of the fiscal rule to contain public spending, along with spending reviews to improve public spending efficiency and expansion of tax bases. The monetary policy rate will remain stable as inflation is gradually approaching the target rate. Continuing to expand trade opportunities via trade agreements that open new markets would help diversify Costa Rica’s concentrated export markets. Growth remains solid amid low inflation Strong net exports and domestic demand boosted GDP growth in the second half of 2024. Household consumption was supported by robust credit consumption growth (8.8% year-on-year in November 2024) and the increase in real wages (5.6% year-on-year in March 2025) and employment (2.5% year-on-year in March 2024). Investment also benefited from strong FDI inflows growing by 14% over the year in December. Economic activity remains robust, with the Monthly Index of Economic Activity increasing by 3.6% (year-on-year) in March 2025, driven by both traditional (utilities, transport) and special regime sectors (manufacturing). Headline inflation continues rising slowly and reached 0.4% (year-on-year) in April 2025. Core inflation is positive but low, at 0.9% in April. Costa Rica 1.

Services (tourism and business services) and semiconductors, a sizable part of Costa Rican exports to the United States, are excluded from the tariff. Perceived country risk, as measured by the Emerging Market Bond Index spread, averaged 2.1% in early May 2025, slightly above the 10-year historical low of around 2% in the first quarter of 2025. Monetary policy will maintain a neutral stance as fiscal policy remains prudent The monetary policy rate is expected to remain at 4% over the projection period, as inflation gradually increases towards the target rate of 3%, and in line with the neutral interest rate (estimated between 1% and 1.9%). The central government primary surplus is projected to remain positive (1.3% of GDP in both 2025 and 2026), as the fiscal rule constrains current expenditure growth. The central government budget deficit is projected to reach 3.3% of GDP in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, reflecting large public debt servicing costs of around 4.7% of GDP in 2025 and 4.5% in 2026. Public debt is expected to continue falling to 59.4% of GDP by end-2026. Trade tensions will slow growth GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025 and 2026. Export growth will weaken in 2025 due to the US tariff on merchandise imports from Costa Rica and is expected to remain subdued in 2026, reflecting moderate global demand and higher trade costs.

Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Increasing violence and criminality may impact negatively tourism and FDI inflows. The high degree of dollarisation of Costa Rica’s economy, with credit in dollars on the rise recently and two thirds of the dollarised debt unhedged, exposes the country to external funding and exchange rate risks, notably against the US dollar. Escalation of geopolitical or trade tensions might provoke trade disruptions and further reduce external demand. On the upside, renewed efforts to deepen trade integration might strengthen net exports. Persevering with reforms will help ensure fiscal sustainability and support investment The fiscal outlook has improved but the fiscal rule should continue to be strictly implemented to limit public spending and further reduce fiscal sustainability risks. Spending reviews should be introduced and tax bases expanded to increase public spending efficiency and create fiscal space. Continuing efforts to open new markets for exports via trade agreements would help export diversification. Eliminating restrictions and caps on private sector participation in electricity generation and retail supply and removing barriers to foreign investment in the electricity sector would help attract investment required for meeting the increasing demand in electricity. Reorientating vocational training towards highly demanded skills (digital and technical) and increasing the number of STEM graduates would support investment, create better jobs and enhance growth. 140  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Croatia GDP is projected to grow by 2.9% in 2025 and 2.7% in 2026. Private consumption growth will moderate as real income growth slows. High uncertainty and moderation in the absorption of EU Structural and Recovery and Resilience Funds will weigh on investment growth. Export growth will be affected by the weakening of foreign demand due to rising trade restrictions. Risks are related to an escalation in trade tensions, mainly through weakening demand from key European trading partners. Fiscal prudence is needed to support disinflation and rebuild fiscal buffers to prepare for the challenges of population ageing, the green transition and higher defence spending. Efforts to enhance the regulatory framework and judicial efficacy are needed to support investment amid high uncertainty. Policies to upskill and reskill the workforce would help alleviate skill shortages and support productivity growth. Economic growth is moderating GDP growth was strong in the last quarter of 2024, but high frequency indicators point to a moderation in the beginning of 2025. Consumer confidence remains subdued, and retail sales growth has continued to slow in early 2025, partly reflecting consumer boycotts of supermarkets and retailers over high food prices in January and February. Harmonised headline consumer price and core inflation moderated to 3.9% and 4.2% in April, respectively, but remain high. The labour market has started to cool.

Export order books are subdued, suggesting weaker foreign demand and increasing uncertainty over international trade. Croatia’s direct trade exposure to the United States is limited, but the country will nevertheless be affected by the recently increased trade tariffs on EU goods through weaker external demand from key European partners. Growth in tourism continues to moderate due to high prices. Easier financial conditions in the euro area have passed through to borrowing costs, and bank lending to the private sector is strong.

Reduced VAT rates on energy were extended into 2025 and the list of food items subject to price caps was expanded amid high inflation. Mild fiscal consolidation is projected for 2026 as energy support and one-off measures are set to be phased out.

The ongoing recovery in households’ real disposable income will support robust consumer demand. High trade policy uncertainty and trade restrictions, especially in the automotive sector, are weighing on investment and exports. The fiscal expansion in Germany and stronger use of EU funds will support faster growth in 2026. Headline inflation is projected to fall back gradually to the 2% target. Risks are tilted to the downside, related to a further escalation of trade tensions that could lead to lower growth. Given high uncertainty, monetary policy needs to remain vigilant. If inflationary pressures subside durably, the central bank should further ease policy interest rates. A broadly neutral fiscal stance is appropriate in the short-term, while spending efficiency needs to be improved in the medium-term to accommodate higher spending for defence, an ageing population and the green transition. Further developing the capital market and streamlining regulations to facilitate the entry and scaling up of firms can boost investment and business dynamism. Household consumption is driving growth GDP growth continued to expand robustly in the first quarter of 2025, by 0.5% compared to the previous quarter, helped by a strong recovery in household consumption. High frequency indicators point to some moderation of growth in the near term. Retail sales growth remained solid in March but economic sentiment declined markedly in April. The manufacturing purchasing managers index continued to recover from a subdued level in April but export orders declined. Falling interest rates supported a pick-up in loan growth to the private sector in the first quarter of 2025. Consumer price inflation eased to 1.8% in April 2025 as food price inflation abated, but service price inflation remained elevated at close to 5%. The labour market remains tight, with employment growth concentrated in the services sector. Labour shortages are contributing to continued strong wage growth. Czechia 1. 3-month moving average.

While direct trade exposure to the United States is limited, with goods exports to the United States accounting for around 3% of total exports in 2024, the recent increase in US tariffs will affect the economy via European manufacturing supply chains, especially for automotive parts. The koruna exchange rate has been relatively stable vis-à-vis the euro since the beginning of 2025. Monetary policy is slightly restrictive and fiscal policy is neutral in 2025 The central bank lowered its policy rate from 7% to 3.5% between December 2023 and May 2025. Monetary policy is projected to remain slightly restrictive in 2025 and broadly neutral in 2026, with the policy rate declining to 3%. The fiscal position has improved significantly, with the budget deficit falling from 3.8% of GDP in 2023 to 2.2% of GDP in 2024, helped by the phasing out of energy support measures and the implementation of a consolidation package. In line with the fiscal-structural plan the projections assume a neutral fiscal stance in 2025 and a moderately restrictive stance in 2026. Growth is set to pick up but uncertainty is high Robust private consumption growth supported by gains in real disposable income will be the main driver of growth in 2025. High trade policy uncertainty will weigh on investment growth this year but a stronger drawing of EU funds will support a pick-up in 2026. Export growth will be subdued due to the increase in trade restrictions, particularly in the automotive sector, which are offset only partly by the fiscal expansion 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Czechia Current prices CZK billion GDP at market prices 6 306.1 2.9 0.1 1.0 1.9 2.2 Private consumption 2 979.5 0.5 -2.7 2.1 3.1 2.8 Government consumption 1 318.7 0.4 3.4 3.3 2.1 1.3 Gross fixed capital formation 1 654.3 6.3 2.7 -1.4 -0.6 2.7 Final domestic demand 5 952.5 2.1 0.1 1.3 1.9 2.5 Stockbuilding¹ 119.4 1.2 -2.7 -0.9 0.8 0.0 Total domestic demand 6 071.9 3.3 -2.6 0.4 2.7 2.5 Exports of goods and services 4 446.9 5.2 3.1 1.5 1.0 2.2 Imports of goods and services 4 212.7 6.0 -0.6 0.7 2.0 2.6 Net exports¹ 234.2 -0.3 2.7 0.6 -0.6 -0.1 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 8.7 8.1 4.0 2.2 2.0 Consumer price index _ 15.1 10.7 2.4 2.4 2.1 Core inflation index² _ 12.2 7.7 4.0 2.8 2.2 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 2.2 2.6 2.6 2.7 2.6 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 11.5 13.1 12.2 11.4 9.6 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -3.1 -3.8 -2.2 -2.2 -1.9 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 45.9 48.6 49.4 50.5 51.1 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 42.5 42.4 43.6 44.6 45.3 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -4.7 -0.1 1.8 0.9 0.8 Percentage changes, volume (2020 prices) 1.

Stronger productivity growth will mitigate labour cost growth and help ease inflation, which should fall back to target in 2026. Risks are tilted to the downside. A further escalation of trade and geopolitical tensions could depress confidence and foreign demand and lead to a resurgence of supply chain disruptions. Managing uncertainty through prudent macroeconomic policy Monetary policy needs to remain vigilant given the high uncertainty about future trade policy and the effects on prices, exchange rates and demand. If inflationary pressures durably subside, the central bank should further ease monetary restrictiveness. In this environment, the neutral fiscal stance in 2025 is broadly appropriate and automatic stabilisers should be allowed to work freely if downside risks materialise. In the medium-term, spending efficiency needs to improve to accommodate spending pressures related to military spending, population ageing and the green transition. For example, building capacity to regularly conduct spending reviews can help identify saving potential without harming outcomes but requires better access to data. Recent reforms to improve the overall sustainability of the pension system should be fully implemented. Further developing the capital market and streamlining regulations to facilitate the entry and scaling up of firms can boost investment and business dynamism. 146  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Denmark After a rebound to 3.7% in 2024, GDP growth is projected to moderate to 3.0% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. Rising household real disposable income will sustain consumption and housing investment. Export growth will be supported by the pharmaceutical sector and the reopening of gas fields but will nevertheless slow amid softer foreign demand. Business investment will lose momentum due to high uncertainty about the global trade outlook. Inflation is projected to decline from 1.9% in 2025 to 1.7% in 2026 as capacity pressures ease and wage growth moderates. Risks are to the downside, as further trade restrictions could hit key export sectors. The central bank is projected to gradually lower policy rates, matching the expected easing of euro area rates. Fiscal policy is expected to be expansionary in 2025 and 2026, while maintaining fiscal space to respond to potential adverse economic shocks. Sustained public support to innovation and knowledge diffusion is needed to safeguard investment and competitiveness and facilitate the green and digital transitions amid rising uncertainty and risks. GDP growth has become more balanced GDP contracted by 0.5% in the first quarter of the year, mostly due to a fall in volatile pharmaceutical exports. Output recovered in non-pharmaceutical sectors and investment in building and construction rebounded. Available indicators suggest a softening of manufacturing activity in early 2025, with low demand identified by firms as the main production constraint. Labour market tightness remains elevated relative to historical norms but has eased. While household purchasing power has improved as employment and real wages have continued to grow; falling consumer confidence has restrained consumption appetite. Housing, energy and food prices have moderated; and headline and core inflation have fallen to around 1.5%. Wage growth has remained aligned with collective agreements and recent negotiations suggest it should slow to around 3.5% per year. House prices have recovered and now exceed their 2022 peak amid lower interest rates. Denmark Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and Danmarks Statistik.

The impact of tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector is limited, as pharmaceutical exports are currently exempt from tariffs and there is substantial production in the United States. The slowdown in international trade flows will affect the maritime transport sector, already challenged by supply overcapacity. The outlook for the wind energy industry has been clouded by increasing investment costs and changes in US energy policy. Denmark is also dependent on prospects for demand in the euro area. Monetary and fiscal policies will be supportive The Danish central bank will follow anticipated rate cuts by the European Central Bank as part of the currency peg arrangement. Lower interest rates will support demand for credit. Stronger than expected labour market outcomes and exceptional revenues from corporate and pension taxes have led to another upward revision of the government balance in 2024. Rising spending on defence with the “Acceleration Fund” in 2025 and 2026 (0.8% of GDP) and personal income tax cuts (0.2% of GDP by 2026) will contribute to reducing the budget surplus. The fiscal impulse is projected to be expansionary in 2025 and 2026, at over 2% of GDP, but additional spending on defence and falling tax revenues from firms operating abroad will have only a limited impact on the domestic economy. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Denmark Current prices DKK billion GDP at market prices 2 567.5 1.5 2.5 3.7 3.0 1.5 Private consumption 1 187.9 -2.1 1.4 0.9 1.1 1.6 Government consumption 613.5 -2.5 0.2 1.4 4.7 0.6 Gross fixed capital formation 578.3 2.8 -6.6 2.7 4.1 0.6 Final domestic demand 2 379.7 -1.0 -0.9 1.5 2.8 1.1 Stockbuilding¹ 27.7 0.6 -1.7 -1.0 0.1 0.1 Total domestic demand 2 407.4 -0.2 -2.7 0.7 3.1 1.2 Exports of goods and services 1 510.4 7.2 10.4 7.5 4.1 2.1 Imports of goods and services 1 350.2 4.4 3.7 3.0 4.0 1.8 Net exports¹ 160.1 1.9 5.1 3.3 0.5 0.4 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 9.1 -3.8 1.8 2.3 1.8 Consumer price index _ 7.7 3.3 1.4 1.9 1.7 Core inflation index² _ 4.0 4.3 1.4 1.5 1.7 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 4.5 5.2 6.3 6.8 6.8 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 3.5 3.0 2.1 2.8 2.6 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ 3.4 3.3 4.5 2.4 1.8 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 40.1 39.8 36.7 34.0 32.1 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 34.1 33.6 31.1 28.4 26.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ 11.7 9.8 13.0 12.5 12.2 Percentage changes, volume (2020 prices) 1.

Exports will lose momentum due to slowing foreign demand, lowering the current account surplus. High uncertainty will weigh on business investment. Tensions on the labour market will ease and employment growth will stabilise. Private consumption will pick up gradually and housing investment will continue to recover, supported by real wage growth and tax reductions. After the rebound in early 2025 due to rising energy and food prices, headline inflation is expected to level off at 1.7% in 2026 in line with moderate labour cost growth and reduced capacity pressures. Economic prospects significantly rely on a few large firms, increasing the level of risks to the outlook. An introduction of tariffs on pharmaceuticals or transport services would further challenge key Danish firms. Stronger-than-expected growth in European main trading partners, following fiscal policy easing in Germany, could boost exports and help restore confidence. Policies should adapt to uncertain economic developments As fiscal space is large, with low public debt and a fiscal surplus, further fiscal policy easing could be envisaged if a further deterioration of the global trade outlook significantly hits the domestic economy. Efforts should concentrate on promoting productive investment for the green and digital transition. Reducing administrative burdens on firms, addressing skills shortages in strategic fields, including STEM, and streamlining processes to establish collaborations between businesses and universities would improve the business environment, stimulating investment and innovation capacities and maintaining high competitiveness. Clarifying government plans for the expansion of renewable energy and further accelerating network infrastructure developments would reduce uncertainty for investors in the energy sector.  149 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Estonia The economy will continue to recover with growth of 1.5% in 2025 and 2% in 2026, despite weaker external demand growth and ongoing tax increases. The recovery will be driven by consumption growth and higher public investment supported by EU funds. Inflation will pick up again in 2025 due to a VAT rise in July but moderate subsequently. Stronger spillovers from global trade developments and geopolitical tensions in the region pose downside risks. The slowing pace of tax increases is appropriate given unfolding global uncertainties, although medium-term fiscal pressures will need to be addressed. Investment in railway connections and electricity grid upgrades should be implemented without delay, as they can help boost the recovery and strengthen Estonia’s security. Increasing uptake of adult learning to drive the digital transition beyond ICT sector could help to improve competitiveness. Growth has resumed, despite headwinds The Estonian economy returned to growth in the middle of 2024, following two years of recession, with the upturn driven by trade and consumption. Although part of the growth in consumer spending was due to year-end car purchases in anticipation of a new vehicle tax this year, households have benefitted from a recovery in real incomes and lower interest rates. Preliminary estimates suggest GDP rose by 1.2% over the year to the first quarter of 2025, confirming the recovery despite growing headwinds. Inflation remained elevated at 4.4% in April, largely due to tax increases, higher prices for services and a pick-up in food prices. The unemployment rate remains high, while employment in manufacturing has started to increase. Business confidence indicators point to an improving outlook and consumer confidence has started to improve but remains subdued. Estonia 1. Excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco.

Trade growth has been sluggish due to the weakness in key export markets in the Nordic region, particularly in construction and manufacturing. Estonia’s direct exposure to trade with the United States is modest, although indirect linkages due to demand from the European market are more significant. The budget deficit has narrowed but will deteriorate again Falling interest rates will support the nascent recovery, but ongoing tax increases will weigh on household consumption. Last year, the budget deficit narrowed to 1.5% of GDP and will remain at a similar level this year. Increases in value added tax (VAT) and excise duties under way will weigh on consumption and temporarily raise headline inflation in the middle of the year. Next year, fiscal policy will ease significantly, and the budget deficit will deteriorate to 3% of GDP, with defence spending set to reach 5 % of GDP from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 and an increase in personal income tax allowance, despite further increases in the rates of personal and corporate income taxes. EU structural funds, targeted at the green and digital transitions of the economy, should strengthen public investment and provide funding for upskilling opportunities and energy-saving measures. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Estonia Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 31.4 0.0 -3.1 -0.2 1.5 2.0 Private consumption 15.8 2.7 -1.6 0.0 1.8 1.9 Government consumption 6.3 -1.4 0.7 0.4 0.2 1.4 Gross fixed capital formation 9.1 -10.3 8.7 -6.7 -0.6 6.5 Final domestic demand 31.2 -2.0 1.7 -1.6 0.8 3.0 Stockbuilding¹ 0.6 1.7 -3.3 1.2 2.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 31.8 -0.6 -1.7 -0.6 2.9 3.0 Exports of goods and services 25.0 5.1 -9.0 -1.1 2.3 2.1 Imports of goods and services 25.4 5.1 -6.6 -0.1 3.2 3.4 Net exports¹ - 0.4 -0.1 -1.9 -0.8 -0.6 -1.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 15.9 8.2 3.6 2.7 1.0 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 19.4 9.1 3.7 4.2 2.3 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 10.3 8.7 5.1 4.0 2.2 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 5.6 6.4 7.5 7.8 7.6 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ -1.6 -0.3 -1.3 0.4 4.2 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -1.1 -3.1 -1.5 -1.5 -3.0 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 26.9 29.6 33.4 32.6 35.4 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 19.1 20.2 23.6 22.8 25.7 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -4.3 -2.2 -1.5 -2.3 -2.9 Percentage changes, volume (2020 prices) 2.

It will be supported by monetary policy easing in the euro area and a pick-up in demand from the Nordic trading partners, as well as by public investment. Much of the defence expenditure increase will be spent on equipment purchases from abroad. Increased uncertainty stemming from both Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and global trade tensions will continue to keep business investment muted. Inflation will temporarily rise in the second half of the year because of tax increases but decline thereafter to 2.3% in 2026. The recovery could be derailed by a worsening of spillovers from global trade developments and geopolitical tensions in the region. More persistent inflationary pressures and wage demands are upside risks to inflation. Reforms are needed to ensure sustainable financing of new spending and enhance competitiveness Given high global uncertainties, the planned more gradual pace of tax increases seems appropriate. The distributional impact of the increased tax burden should be carefully assessed. Higher defence expenditures and spending pressures from an ageing population will eventually require new sources of revenue, which could come for instance from an annual tax on property. Ongoing expenditure reviews should continue. Public investment projects such as international railway connections and electricity grid upgrades can help strengthen Estonia’s security and should be implemented without delay. To advance the digital transition among businesses beyond the ICT sector and contribute to improving competitiveness, it will be important to increase the uptake of adult learning. 152  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Euro area GDP growth is projected to strengthen to 1% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026 as foreign demand recovers. Private consumption will be supported by sustained growth of real disposable incomes. Private investment will be constrained by high uncertainty but will benefit from improved financing conditions; public investment will be supported by the Recovery and Resilience Facility funds. Wage growth is projected to ease gradually, helping core inflation to return to 2% by the second half of 2025. Fiscal policy will tighten in 2025 and remain broadly neutral in 2026, as countries make use of the national escape clauses under the new fiscal rules. Although defence spending is set to rise and debt financing could be required in the short term, prudent fiscal policy is needed to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability. Monetary policy should remain prudent to ensure that inflation is durably reduced to target. Reducing regulatory burdens on labour mobility would help alleviate labour shortages, while progress on financial integration could boost cross-border financial flows, lifting private investment. The economy remains resilient amid increasing global uncertainty. GDP grew by 0.3% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2025. Recent indicators suggested some rebound in the economy, but the composite PMI declined in May, reflecting weakening in services and only modestly improving activity in manufacturing. Headline inflation stood at 2.2% in April, unchanged from March. Core inflation increased to 2.7% in April, from 2.4% in March, partly driven by the timing of Easter, but market and survey-based inflation expectations have remained broadly stable at the 2% target since December 2024. Services inflation also increased in April, to 4% in annual terms, up from 3.5% in March. The labour market is gradually normalising, with both employment growth and nominal wage growth slowing in the fourth quarter of 2024. At the same time, the euro area seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained low at 6.2% in March. Financial conditions continue to be mildly restrictive, with the corporate demand for loans decreasing, but a continuing rebound in housing loans and other lending to households. The number of bankruptcies fell slightly in the fourth quarter of 2024, from a high level in the first half of the year. Benign energy prices and increasing exports of chemicals and manufactured goods brought the goods trade surplus to EUR 44 billion or 0.3% of euro area GDP in March. Exports were affected by front-loading amid growing trade frictions and elevated geopolitical tensions. At the same time, the balance of services trade remained positive, and the current account surplus for the last 12 months increased to 2.9% of GDP in March. Energy commodity prices have decreased, but the recovery from the recent energy price shock has been uneven, with output and profits of energy-intensive firms decreasing. The US has introduced a 10% tariff on imports of EU goods, with a 25% tariff on imports of steel and aluminium and cars and car parts. The EU postponed its countermeasures for 90 days in April. In support of Ukraine, EU countries have extended temporary protection to more than 4 million Ukrainian refugees until March 2026, helping to reduce labour shortages in certain sectors. The EU has disbursed almost EUR 20 billion (0.1% of euro area GDP) from the EUR 50 billion Ukraine Facility and approved an additional loan of up to EUR 35 billion (0.2% of euro area GDP), financed by proceeds from frozen Russian assets.  153 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Euro area 1 1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/maqz6b Macroeconomic policy is to become less restrictive The aggregate euro area fiscal stance is projected to tighten by about ¼% of GDP in 2025 and remain broadly unchanged in 2026. The fiscal measures to stem the effects of the energy crisis have been withdrawn, while spending under the NextGenerationEU (NGEU) programme could provide support of about 1% of GDP in 2025 and 2026. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has triggered additional military spending and the EU fiscal rules were relaxed by allowing the coordinated use of national escape clauses for up to 1.5% of GDP per year for defence purposes, enabling additional spending of about EUR 650 billion (4.3% of euro area GDP) over the next four years. In addition, the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) instrument will allow EU countries to borrow up to EUR 150 billion to facilitate the increase in defence spending. The European Central Bank’s monetary policy stance has become less restrictive, as the deposit facility rate has been cut by a cumulative 175 basis points since June 2024, to 2.25% in April 2025. The policy rate is projected to decrease further, reaching 1.75% in the latter part of 2025. While the interest rate cuts will support aggregate demand, the overall policy stance is projected to remain cautious for some time to durably reduce inflation to the 2% target. The short-term inflationary pressures stem from labour shortages and additional public expenditure under the NGEU programme, estimated to total 2.5% of GDP by end-2026. Economic growth will strengthen as domestic demand picks up Growth is projected to strengthen, supported by easing financial conditions and lower energy prices. The labour market will remain tight, with labour shortages in some occupations and historically low unemployment slowing down wage growth normalisation. Growing real disposable incomes will support consumption, albeit at a slowing rate as disinflation comes to an end. Elevated uncertainty related to trade tensions will weigh on private investment, but public investment will be supported by spending under the NGEU programme. Headline inflation is projected to moderate further, as labour cost pressures gradually dissipate. Core inflation is also projected to decline, returning to the level consistent with the ECB inflation target by mid-2026.  155 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Risks to the projections are tilted to the downside. Worsening trade tensions, such as an increase in US reciprocal tariffs and possible EU countermeasures, would weigh on external demand, while the tariffs already in place could trigger unfavourable trade diversion flows towards the euro area. Trade retaliation measures by the EU could add to inflationary pressures. Financial stability risks continue to exist in the euro area, with pockets of financial vulnerabilities in the commercial real estate and nonbanking financial sector. On the upside, a stronger use of accumulated household savings could strengthen private consumption. In addition, a durable reduction of geopolitical uncertainty and trade tensions could hasten disinflation and help lift external demand. Structural reforms are needed to complement prudent macroeconomic policies The investment needs associated with defence, energy security and decarbonisation are considerable. While defence spending is set to rise, it should not be financed by debt issuance in the long term. Reprioritisation of fiscal spending and prudent fiscal policy will be needed to rebuild fiscal buffers and address other spending pressures, such as population ageing. Effective disbursement of the NGEU funds will help expand medium-term productive capacity but it is associated with short-term inflationary risks that need to be monitored at the EU level. The new EU fiscal rules encourage structural reforms and safeguards for medium-term fiscal sustainability, but the impending activation of the national escape clauses may further delay reduction of existing excessive deficits. To ensure a level playing field and effective use of public funds, state-aid rules should not be relaxed further. The monetary policy stance should not be eased prematurely and macroprudential instruments should be used to address potential financial sector vulnerabilities. Furthermore, labour shortages could be alleviated by attracting high-skilled non-EU workers and by reducing regulatory and administrative burdens on intra-EU mobility. Finally, progress on the Capital Markets Union and the banking union could help boost cross-border financial flows, lifting private investment. 156  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Finland The Finnish economy is set to grow by 0.7% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026 after contracting by 0.1% in 2024. Lower interest rates will support private consumption and investment, notwithstanding subdued confidence. Inflation is projected to remain modest, as lower energy prices and weak activity offset pressures from rising import costs. Imports should recover gradually, while export growth will be dampened by trade restrictions and lower global growth. Unemployment will remain elevated in 2025 before gradually declining. Russian hybrid warfare, including infrastructure sabotage and cyber-attacks, and escalating trade barriers continue to be key risks. Fiscal consolidation remains essential to place public debt on a downward path, amid rising pressures from population ageing and growing defence and security needs. Priorities include improving the efficiency of spending, particularly in health, and further normalising reduced VAT rates once the recovery is firmly underway. Boosting private R&D investment, expanding the pool of high-skilled workers through a more effective allocation of study places and better integration of foreign talent, as well as enhancing investment in renewable energy, will be key to strengthen innovation and investment and revive productivity. Weak confidence and high unemployment continue to weigh on the recovery Economic activity is gradually recovering. GDP grew in the first three quarters of 2024 but stalled in the fourth quarter, mainly due to sluggish private consumption and investment, before rising by an estimated 0.1% in the first quarter of 2025. Consumer and business confidence remain below long-term averages, particularly in construction. The unemployment rate stood at 9.5% in March, up from 8.4% a year earlier, reflecting continued weakness in construction and job losses in the public sector. Both headline and core inflation have picked up somewhat in 2025, although lower energy prices and subdued domestic demand are helping to contain underlying inflationary pressures. Wage growth moderated in 2024 after strong gains in 2023, but nominal earnings still outpaced inflation. House prices have stabilised after earlier declines, while falling interest rates are reducing household mortgage expenses. Finland 1. Real price index of old dwellings in housing companies.

Weak demand in key trading partners has dampened exports, while escalating trade restrictions, including the 10% US import tariffs on EU goods and increasing geoeconomic fractures have heightened uncertainty. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine continues to weigh on regional stability and the economic recovery. Russian hybrid warfare threats, including cyberattacks and infrastructure sabotage, have undermined business sentiment. The fiscal stance needs to tighten more Fiscal policy is set to tighten gradually in 2025, following an expansionary stance in 2024, with consolidation of a bit over ½ per cent of GDP. The fiscal deficit widened to 4.4% of GDP in 2024, driven by rising pension costs and spending pressures from health and defence, which were only partly offset by higher revenue from the increase in the standard VAT rate in September. Most wellbeing services counties, which assumed responsibility for social welfare and healthcare from municipalities in 2023, continue to record deficits despite efforts to reduce staffing. Ongoing consolidation, including spending cuts in social welfare programmes, is projected to reduce the deficit to 3.7% this year. The General Government Fiscal Plan for 2026–29 announced in April will slow the pace of consolidation. The plan includes cuts to personal and corporate income tax rates and a rise in defence spending, from 2.4% of GDP in 2024 to 3% by 2029, part of which will be implemented only after the 2026 projection horizon. Abstracting from the uncertain dynamic effects of tax cuts, these measures widen the fiscal gap by around 1.7% of GDP. With European Central Bank policy rates gradually declining, retail interest rates in Finland have been adjusting swiftly, given the high share of variable-rate mortgages, which will help drive a moderate recovery. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Finland Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 248.8 0.8 -0.9 -0.1 0.7 1.1 Private consumption 125.3 0.9 0.0 -0.1 0.0 1.7 Government consumption 61.7 -0.6 3.4 0.7 0.1 0.1 Gross fixed capital formation 60.7 1.5 -7.4 -7.1 -0.2 3.9 Final domestic demand 247.7 0.7 -1.0 -1.5 0.0 1.8 Stockbuilding¹ , ² 0.9 2.0 -3.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 248.6 2.8 -4.0 -0.8 0.0 1.7 Exports of goods and services 99.3 4.4 0.2 0.1 0.6 -0.7 Imports of goods and services 99.2 9.3 -6.7 -2.4 -0.2 0.9 Net exports¹ 0.1 -1.9 3.3 1.1 0.3 -0.7 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.2 3.5 1.4 1.6 1.9 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 7.2 4.3 1.0 1.8 1.9 Harmonised index of core inflation³ _ 3.6 4.1 2.2 2.5 2.0 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 6.8 7.3 8.4 9.1 8.7 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 1.5 2.0 2.8 4.1 4.3 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -0.2 -3.0 -4.4 -3.7 -3.2 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 81.4 85.6 90.4 93.7 96.3 General government debt, Maastricht definition⁴ (% of GDP) _ 74.0 77.5 82.1 85.4 88.0 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -2.4 -0.4 0.1 -0.2 -0.9 Percentage changes, volume (2015 prices) 3.

Lower interest rates, rising real wages and stabilising house prices are expected to support private consumption. Investment is also set to recover gradually, although heightened uncertainty, persistent weakness in construction and elevated unemployment may continue to weigh on domestic demand. Exports are projected to slow due to increasing trade restrictions and weak trading partner growth. Inflation is expected to remain moderate, at around 2% in 2025 and 2026, as rising import costs are partly offset by lower energy prices. The recovery is fragile and risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. A further escalation of global trade tensions could weaken export performance and delay investment. The persistent geopolitical rift with Russia may dampen confidence and foreign investment. On the upside, positive spillovers from stronger-than-expected investment in the green industrial transition or higher-than-anticipated large-scale defence and industrial orders, such as for steel and icebreakers, could lift growth above current projections. Facilitating investment and expanding the skilled workforce are key to boosting productivity Stepping up fiscal consolidation is key to reversing the rise in public debt and rebuilding fiscal buffers in the face of population ageing and growing security needs. Improving the efficiency of public spending, particularly in the health sector and wellbeing services counties, remains essential for achieving debt sustainability. Further normalising reduced VAT rates as the recovery gains traction would help broaden the tax base and raise revenue. Strengthening investment through government support, such as R&D tax credits, and improving regulatory predictability, especially in renewable energy, forestry and clean technologies, will spur Finland’s green industrial transition, where the country holds vast potential. Additionally, expanding the supply of high-skilled labour through better allocation of higher education places, faster completion rates, and more effective attraction and integration of foreign talent would also help boost innovation, investment and productivity.  159 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 France After growing below potential in 2023-24, at 1.1%, GDP growth is set to slow further to 0.6% in 2025 due to heightened economic policy uncertainty, before gradually recovering to 0.9% in 2026. Private consumption will become the main growth engine in 2025, as exports will suffer from increased trade tensions and investment will be held back by increased uncertainty. The recovery in 2026 is set to be supported by stronger investment and steady consumer spending. Inflation is expected to fall to 1.2% in 2025, driven by cuts in electricity tariffs, before edging up to 1.7% in 2026. The fiscal deficit is expected to narrow gradually to 5.4% and 5% in 2025 and 2026, respectively, from 5.8% of GDP in 2024. As the associated fiscal effort, of 1% of GDP in 2025, would be the largest in over a decade, there is a significant risk of fiscal slippages. Weaker-than-expected growth and rising defence spending would also make it harder to reach fiscal targets. Public debt is projected to remain high at nearly 120% of GDP in 2026. Stabilisation will require continued deficit reduction and growth-enhancing reforms. To unlock greater investment, structural reforms should prioritise digital uptake, simplifying regulations in the services sector and better targeting of innovation support towards innovative small and medium-sized enterprises. Activity has slowed amidst rising policy uncertainty Economic activity grew by 1.1% in 2024, reflecting a degree of resilience amid a challenging policy environment, heightened uncertainty after a government no-confidence vote, and a mild output fall in the fourth quarter that reduced the 2025 carry-over. GDP rebounded moderately in the first quarter of 2025, driven primarily by inventory accumulation, while private consumption stagnated and both investment and net exports both declined. However, business investment has stabilised since two quarters, after nearly five consecutive quarters of decline. Indicators remain gloomy though. Business confidence has remained below its long-term average since August 2024, while household confidence hit its lowest since the Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine began. The labour market has worsened, with employment falling by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Inflation decreased faster than expected at the end of 2024 and early 2025, reaching 0.9% year-on-year in April, helped by lower regulated tariffs on electricity in February. Core inflation continues to be higher than headline inflation. Business uncertainty has risen due to the lack of clarity around the tariffs imposed by the United States and potential retaliation by other major economies. France’s direct exposure to higher US tariffs on EU goods is relatively limited, with the US accounting for 5% of exports and 5.3% of imports of goods. However, France remains highly vulnerable to a broader slowdown in global demand, especially in Europe, which is the destination for 55% of its exports. 160  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 France 1 Source: www.policyuncertainty.com; and Banque de France.

Year-on-year growth rates. Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. StatLink 2https://stat.link/spxefh Credit conditions will improve while fiscal policy will tighten The fiscal deficit is projected to have been 5.8% of GDP in 2024, slightly lower than earlier expectations. The government is targeting a reduction to 5.4% of GDP in 2025, requiring a 1% improvement in the structural primary balance, with additional measures beyond the current Budget. If fully implemented, this would be the strongest improvement since 2010. A consolidation effort in line with the government’s announcements is incorporated in the projections. Most of the consolidation will come from higher taxes, including exceptional taxes on high-income earners and large profitable firms, as well as on air travel and high-emitting vehicles. On the spending side, measures include a slowdown in municipal spending, cuts in central government spending, lower subsidies for low-wage workers, reductions in sick leave benefits and a tightening of unemployment benefits. No detailed consolidation plan has been set for 2026; an effort of 0.7% of GDP is assumed, though rising defence spending may hinder this. Since mid-2024, European Central Bank policy interest rate cuts have eased lending conditions, gradually supporting business and housing investment. However, private sector debt repayments remain high because of fixed-rate loans from the earlier high-interest period. The interest rate on new housing loans (excluding renegotiations) declined to 3.2% in March, the lowest level since May 2023, while new loan rates to businesses fell to 3.76%, 95 basis points lower than a year ago. The sovereign spread between France and Germany also narrowed to 68 basis points in May, almost 20 basis points below its December 2024 peak amid political turmoil. Nevertheless, it remains elevated relative to its long-term average, reflecting ongoing concerns over debt and economic policy uncertainty. High economic policy uncertainty will delay the rebound in growth Economic growth is expected to slow significantly in 2025, with the output gap widening throughout the next two years, driven by heightened uncertainty and rising trade tensions. The contribution of exports to growth will weaken. Private consumption will be supported by disinflation, transfers indexed on past inflation and a lower saving rate—though real income gains will be tempered by a slowing in wage catch- 162  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 up compared to 2024 and higher taxes on income. Unemployment is expected to rise with the slowdown in growth. The social assistance (RSA) reform requiring beneficiaries to register with public employment services and actively search for a job will add upward pressure on the unemployment rate while tighter low-wage subsidies may also reduce the employability of this group. Business investment will remain subdued over 2025 and will only gradually recover towards the end of the year, given weak trade prospects and policy uncertainty. Residential investment is expected to turn positive from mid-2025, following a progressive rise in building permits since the last quarter of 2024. Ahead of municipal elections, public investment is expected to rise in 2025, albeit at a slower pace. Inflation is expected to ease further in 2025, as economic activity slows and tariffs on US imports only have a limited impact due to France’s low exposure to the US market. The gap between headline and core inflation is expected to narrow as energy prices stabilise and services inflation eases. Risks are tilted to the downside. Higher tariffs on French exports and those of its key partners, especially in Europe, could weaken growth further. Retaliatory trade measures could push inflation higher. A softer stance on fiscal consolidation would support growth but push up the public debt ratio, raising bond yields and crowding out private investment. The risk of renewed policy turmoil later this year – due to the absence of a clear majority in the National Assembly – and the resulting uncertainty over fiscal policy may further constrain firms’ investment decisions. Stabilising debt and raising potential output call for broad-based reforms Sticking to fiscal consolidation plans is essential for France to stabilise and reduce public debt. While efforts so far have focused on tax increases, achieving medium-term fiscal targets will require a broader strategy, including spending cuts, shifting the tax structure toward less distortive taxes and implementing structural reforms to boost potential growth. Greater support for the labour market participation of older workers should focus on lifelong learning, especially investment in digital skills. Accelerating investment in digital technologies, especially among SMEs, requires boosting fibre adoption by clarifying tariffs and service offers, and by lowering installation costs. The innovation ecosystem is strong and dynamic but incentives for research and development should be more directed towards SMEs with high potential for breakthrough innovation. Further streamlining administrative procedures, easing regulatory barriers to market entry and simplifying regulations in key service sectors would stimulate competition and attract new capital.  163 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Germany The economy is projected to grow by 0.4% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. Private consumption will increase due to low inflation, rising nominal wages and decreasing domestic policy uncertainty following the formation of a new government. High trade policy uncertainty will hamper investment in export-oriented manufacturing but, overall, private investment will pick up, supported by high corporate savings, declining interest rates and lower domestic policy uncertainty. Public investment in defence and infrastructure will rise strongly due to the increased flexibility in the fiscal rules and large investment needs. Rising US tariffs will weigh on foreign demand. Ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability requires improved public spending efficiency, reallocation of spending and broadening the tax base, while addressing rising spending pressures due to rapid population ageing. Continuing to reduce the administrative burden, digitalise the public administration and improve infrastructure implementation capacity, particularly at the municipal level, is needed to support the pick-up in public and private investment. To avoid rising inflationary pressures due to the significant demand shock from fiscal easing, it is key to reduce barriers to firm entry and growth and address skilled labour shortages. Weak external demand and high uncertainty have weighed on economic activity Real GDP increased by 1.7% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (saar) in the first quarter of 2025, mainly driven by private consumption and investment. Energy prices remain higher than before the war in Ukraine, particularly affecting output in energy-intensive industries. Monthly manufacturing production increased by 3% in March and was 0.2% below the level a year earlier. Despite an increase of real wages by 3.1% in 2024, the recovery of private consumption has been slow due to high domestic policy uncertainty. However, since the federal elections in February and a reform of the fiscal rules in March, policy uncertainty has declined. The ifo business expectations indicator has increased since March, despite higher trade policy uncertainty. Retail sale volumes decreased in March by 0.2% but stood 2.2% above the previous year’s level. Annual headline inflation declined to 2.2 % in April from 2.3% in March, mainly driven by declining energy prices. However, core inflation remains sticky, at 3.1% in April, due to strong services price inflation of 4.5% driven by strong nominal wage gains. Although labour markets have cooled, they remain robust with low unemployment and high vacancies still signalling strong labour shortages. Rising trade protection and increasing competition from China in key export markets have weighed on export volumes, which strongly declined in the second half of 2024. However, in March 2025, nominal exports were 2.3% above the level observed one year earlier, helped by rising export prices and a structural shift in manufacturing towards higher value-added products. The recent rise in uncertainty about future US trade policy also led to a front-loading of exports in the first quarter of 2025. Higher US tariffs will strongly affect manufacturing firms as about 10% of total goods exports are shipped to the United States. 164  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Germany 1 Source: Federal Statistical Office; Bundesbank; ifo business surveys; and GfK.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/1qpxgz Defence spending and infrastructure investment are set to increase strongly The fiscal stance will tighten by 0.3% of GDP in 2025 and expand by 0.9% of GDP in 2026. Due to the fall of the previous coalition government and failure to conclude negotiations on the 2025 budget, a provisional budget for 2025 extends nominal spending levels from 2024 to 2025. However, a recent reform of the national fiscal rules will allow for raising investments in defence and infrastructure in the next few years. Additional spending exceeding 1% of GDP in the areas of defence, civil protection, intelligence services, protection of IT systems, and support for states attacked in violation of international law will be exempted from the fiscal rules. A special infrastructure fund will provide up to EUR 500 bn or about 12% of GDP for additional investment in infrastructure and the green transformation over the next 12 years. Moreover, the structural deficit ceiling for sub-national governments will be raised from 0% to 0.35% of GDP, and EUR 100 billion from the new infrastructure fund will be allocated to fund local public investment. The effects of this reform on public investment are expected to start materialising only in 2026 as the approval of the 2025 and 2026 budget and detailed investment plans as well as infrastructure planning and procurement procedures will take time. Negotiations to form a new coalition government have been successful. The policy plans laid out in the coalition treaty emphasise the need to strengthen defence and internal security, address the large infrastructure backlog, revive the stagnating economy, modernise and digitalise the public administration, and address skilled labour shortages. It is planned to raise depreciation allowances for equipment investment, reduce the electricity tax and network charges, raise subsidies for energy-intensive firms, and support the car industry by increasing subsidies for electric vehicles and the commuter allowance. Labour supply incentives are planned to be raised by exempting additional income from working extra-hours, wage premia if switching from part-time to full time work, and earnings of workers above the statutory retirement age from labour taxes. 166  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The recovery will be driven by domestic demand GDP will grow by 0.4% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. Private consumption will increase due to low inflation, rising nominal wages and declining domestic policy uncertainty. High trade policy uncertainty will hamper investment in export-oriented manufacturing but, overall, private investment will pick up, supported by high corporate savings, declining interest rates and decreasing domestic policy uncertainty, including on the financing of measures to support firms during the green transition. Public investment in defence and infrastructure will rise strongly due to the increased flexibility in the fiscal rules and large investment needs. Rising US tariffs will weigh on export demand. Headline inflation will converge towards 2% in 2026, but core inflation will be sticky, reflecting the impact of wage gains amidst skilled labour shortages and rising public investment and domestic demand. A further escalation in trade policy tensions would weigh on GDP, as the manufacturing sector is strongly integrated in global supply chains and the United States is the main export market. If public procurement and infrastructure planning and approval procedures are not accelerated, the implementation of public investment projects will be delayed, reducing GDP growth in 2026. Moreover, if structural reforms to support the supply side of the economy are not implemented, the significant demand shock from increased public investment may lead to strongly rising inflationary pressures. Structural reforms should complement the reform of fiscal rules Further simplification and harmonisation of public procurement, infrastructure planning and approval procedures should be combined with improvements to the capacity of public administration, particularly at the local level. This will ensure a quick and efficient implementation of public investment projects. To avoid rising inflationary pressures, it is key to combine the reform of the fiscal rules with structural reforms. Reducing high administrative burdens and regulatory barriers to entry and growth of firms, particularly in construction and services, is key to strengthen competition and revive business dynamism, investment and innovation. This will require accelerating the digitalization of the public administration, including by setting mandatory common IT standards, and expanding efforts to review, simplify and harmonise existing regulations and administrative procedures across levels of government. Occupational entry regulations and licensing requirements to open a business should be reduced to strengthen competition. Shifting the tax burden away from labour towards capital income and wealth, for example by reducing inheritance tax exemptions for business assets, would help improve labour supply incentives. Reducing fiscal incentives for early retirement would improve work incentives for older workers and help to stabilise pension spending amidst rising fiscal pressures due to ageing. To address skilled labour shortages, it is key to expand training opportunities for workers and the unemployed, including support for completing formal VET degrees.  167 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Greece GDP growth is projected to remain resilient at 2.0% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. Disbursements of EU Recovery and Resilience Funds will strengthen investment, and minimum wage increases will support a pick-up in consumption, as exports slow alongside external demand. Headline inflation will ease to 2.0% in 2026, helped by lower oil prices, despite rising trade costs and persistent services inflation. Implementation delays of EU funds, excessive wage growth or renewed extreme weather events could dampen the outlook. Sizeable primary fiscal surpluses are projected in 2025 and in 2026, at 2.1% and 2.2% of GDP respectively, underpinned by improved tax compliance. Keeping public debt on a firmly declining path should remain a priority, as ageing costs and investment needs add to future spending pressures. Maintaining the reform momentum to improve the business environment and ease high labour shortages would support investment growth. Continuing efforts to reduce tax evasion and limit tax expenditures would raise revenues, while making room to reduce the labour tax on low-wage earners, and encouraging further employment gains. The economy remains strong The economy grew by 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by investment. Business expectations in manufacturing and service sectors have softened but continued to point towards expansion in April 2025. Employment rose by 0.5% in the year to March 2025, while nominal wages grew by 5.4% in the year to the fourth quarter of 2024, with labour shortages remaining historically high. Annual headline inflation remained elevated at 2.6% in April 2025 and core inflation stood at 3.8%, driven by services price inflation.

Lending to non-financial corporations from August 2024 to March 2025 was 14% higher than a year earlier. Interest rates for new loans to households and firms fell from 5.7% in August 2024 to 4.3% in March 2025. The trade deficit widened in 2024, with import growth outpacing exports amidst moderate growth in tourism. Travel receipts over the second half of 2024 were 1.8% higher than a year earlier, down from high growth rates in previous years, and exports of goods in the fourth quarter of 2024 were 3.3% lower compared than a year earlier. Trade links with the United States are limited, but new US tariffs will also weigh on exports by lowering demand from trading partners such as Germany. Fiscal policy will remain supportive The fiscal stance will remain supportive, as disbursements of Recovery and Resilience grants and loans are projected to rise from 1.8% of GDP in 2024 to 3.6% in 2026. Stronger tax revenues, bolstered by enhanced tax collection measures, are projected to support sustained primary surpluses and create room for additional spending. A primary surplus of 2.1% of GDP in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026 will contribute to a further decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio to 140% in 2026 (Maastricht definition). New fiscal measures for 2025 include a reduction in social security contributions by 1 percentage point (0.2% of 2024 GDP) and permanent increases of incomes for pensioners (0.2% of GDP) and public servants (0.1% of GDP).

Public sector wages, which were frozen, are being raised to align with the rising minimum wage. Growth will remain resilient GDP growth is projected to remain resilient at 2.0% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. Rising disposable income will support a pick-up in consumption. Investment growth, supported by growing disbursements of Recovery and Resilience Funds, will remain robust despite heightened international uncertainty. Rising labour shortages will moderate employment growth while supporting rising wages. New US tariffs and easing external demand, notably from EU trading partners, will slow export growth. Headline inflation is projected to return slowly towards 2.0% in 2026 amidst persistent core inflation. Implementation delays of the Recovery and Resilience Plan “Greece 2.0” could put the planned investment growth at risk. If wage growth were to persistently outpace productivity gains, this could weaken exports further. Extreme weather events, such as the 2023 floods in Thessaly, could also weigh on domestic demand. Strengthening investment further is a key challenge The still high public debt level poses risks in the medium-term, while population ageing and climate change add to future domestic spending pressures. Low productivity continues to hold back competitiveness and living standards. Boosting investment will be key to strengthening growth while maintaining public debt on a firmly declining path. This will require an easing of remaining regulatory burdens and improvements in workers’ skills. Formalising and accelerating the review of existing business regulations while ensuring an effective consultation of stakeholders on new legislation would help continue recent success with making the regulatory framework more business friendly. Strengthening vocational training, rebalancing labour market policies towards training and counselling for unemployed workers and ensuring high training quality would reduce skill mismatches. Further reducing tax evasion and limiting tax expenditures – notably reduced VAT rates, which mostly benefit wealthy households – would raise revenue, making room for targeted social contribution cuts to strengthen work incentives. 170  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Hungary After growing by 0.5% in 2024, GDP is projected to increase by 0.9% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026. Private consumption, supported by real wage growth, will be the main engine of growth, especially in 2025. Following a significant decline in 2024, investment is expected to increase gradually but will remain hampered by weak economic prospects and trade policy uncertainty. Exports are projected to pick-up in line with demand from Hungary’s main trading partners, but growth in the euro area, particularly Germany, is a key risk for the economy. Monetary policy easing is expected to continue, but at a moderate pace to ensure that inflation reverts back to target. While necessary to prepare for rising ageing-related spending needs, fiscal consolidation is weakening. Better financing conditions, lower trade policy uncertainty and full implementation of recent public integrity reforms will be key to support a rebound in investment. Reforming the insolvency framework would facilitate capital reallocation towards productive investments. Improving regulations in energy, transport and professional services would encourage business creation. Economic activity is weak Economic growth has been volatile since 2023, with alternating quarters of positive and negative GDP growth. In 2024 as a whole, GDP growth was only 0.5% and GDP declined by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025. While strong real wage growth supported private consumption, there was a strong decline in investment due to low business confidence, low capacity utilisation and tight financing conditions as monetary policy remained restrictive to fight remaining inflationary pressures. Headline inflation ticked up to 5.6% in February 2025 due higher food and energy prices. It was still 4.2% in April and core inflation remains above 5%. Despite subdued economic activity, the labour market is robust. Unemployment declined to 4.2% in March 2025 and job vacancies are high. Hungary 1.

Higher US tariffs on EU goods will thus indirectly weigh on Hungary through reduced activity in the European Union and Germany, representing 65% and 21% of total Hungarian exports, respectively. Monetary policy is expected to continue easing at a moderate pace and the fiscal stance to weaken in 2026 Given persistent services inflation and exchange rate weakening, the central bank has kept its policy rate at 6.5% since September 2024. Looking ahead, it is expected to implement gradual and small policy rate cuts to ensure that inflation reverts back to the 3% target. The policy rate is projected to settle around 5.5% by the end of 2026. The headline fiscal deficit is expected to narrow from 4.9% of GDP in 2024 to 4.2% in 2025 and 4.0% in 2026, which is still higher than before the pandemic. Abstracting from business cycle developments and interest payments, the fiscal stance is projected to be neutral in 2025 and to weaken in 2026, after two years of significant fiscal consolidation. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Hungary Current prices HUF billion GDP at market prices 55 560.5 4.3 -0.8 0.5 0.9 2.4 Private consumption 26 761.3 6.9 -1.0 5.1 5.4 3.9 Government consumption 11 552.0 3.2 3.3 -4.6 0.6 0.9 Gross fixed capital formation 15 144.2 0.7 -7.7 -11.1 -3.0 5.4 Final domestic demand 53 457.5 4.2 -2.1 -1.4 2.3 3.6 Stockbuilding¹ 2 041.0 0.2 -3.6 1.2 -0.2 0.0 Total domestic demand 55 498.4 4.2 -5.1 -0.1 2.2 3.6 Exports of goods and services 44 126.5 10.7 1.7 -3.0 -0.4 2.4 Imports of goods and services 44 064.5 10.7 -3.4 -4.0 1.2 4.1 Net exports¹ 62.0 0.0 4.8 0.6 -1.2 -1.1 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 14.2 15.2 7.3 6.5 4.0 Consumer price index _ 14.6 17.1 3.7 4.9 3.6 Core inflation index² _ 10.2 13.8 5.7 5.2 3.6 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 3.6 4.1 4.5 4.3 3.9 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 11.8 14.4 15.5 12.8 12.2 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -6.2 -6.7 -4.9 -4.2 -4.0 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 77.5 81.9 82.2 81.7 82.1 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 73.9 73.0 73.5 73.5 74.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -8.6 0.3 2.2 1.6 0.5 Percentage changes, volume (2021 prices) 2.

Private consumption will be supported by strong real wage growth, especially in 2025, and the household saving rate returning to its long-run level after a significant increase since the pandemic. Inflation is projected to be slightly above 3% by the end of 2026. Investment is expected to rebound progressively but will be hampered by low business confidence, low capacity utilisation, and significant trade policy uncertainty. Exports are projected to pick up but will remain closely connected to external demand from Hungary’s main trading partners, especially Germany. Economic activity in these countries is a key risk to the outlook. The availability of new manufacturing capacity, especially in the automotive sector, may provide a further boost to Hungarian exports over 2025-26, but industrial capacity utilisation is currently low and the potential of the new factories will be fully exploited only if external demand picks up significantly. Structural reforms would improve fiscal sustainability and long-term growth Reforming public pensions would limit the increase in ageing-related spending, which is projected to exceed 5 percentage points of GDP by 2070 under current legislation. Beyond possible options to tighten eligibility conditions and adjust benefit levels, financing future pensions will require additional fiscal space, which calls for consolidation. As a share of GDP, investment remains higher than the EU average but has significantly weakened in recent years. Better financing conditions, reduced trade policy uncertainty, and fully implementing recent reforms to promote public integrity and bolster investor confidence will be key to reverse this trend. Improving the insolvency framework would also facilitate the reallocation of capital across firms and the financing of productive investments. Improved regulations in the energy, transport, professional services and telecommunication sectors would strengthen competition and support the entry of new firms and investments in these sectors.  173 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Iceland GDP growth is set to recover to 1.4% in 2025 and 2.8% in 2026, driven by household consumption and the rebound of exports. Business investment will be strong in 2025 but weaken in 2026 as several projects will end. Unemployment will edge up, but the labour market remains tight. Major risks include a violent volcanic eruption and further tariff escalation affecting Iceland’s main export goods. In May, the central bank cut the policy rate to 7.5%, the fifth cut since monetary easing started in October 2024. Inflation has fallen to around 4% and is expected to reach the target by the second half of 2026. The new government has committed to a tight fiscal stance over the next two years, which will help underpin disinflation and build up fiscal space. Reforming the fiscal framework and business regulation will help increase stability and sustainability of the public finances and foster productivity, investment and growth. Economic growth has likely bottomed out Economic growth has slowed against the backdrop of tight monetary policy but seems to have passed its low point. Household consumption is expanding gradually, driven by growing real wages following the 2024 agreements and rising consumer confidence. The wage agreements of 2024 imply wage increases of over 6% per year including wage drift. Business investment has begun to recover from the downturn in the second half of 2024 as financial conditions eased. Despite slowing population growth, investment in housing remains substantial, supported by rising incomes. Exports have rebounded, particularly in the fisheries sector, which benefits from increased catch quotas. The unemployment rate has risen slightly from around 3.5% at the end of 2024. Volcanic activity on the Reykjanes peninsula has had minimal impact over the past six months. Various inflation measures have declined sharply, but annual headline inflation, at 4.2% in April, is still well above the 2.5% target. Iceland 1. Year-on-year growth rates.

Icelandic goods are subject to a general 10% US import tariff. The additional increase in US tariffs on aluminium imports from 10% to 25% in March has had little effect so far, as Iceland does not export aluminium to the United States. Monetary policy is easing, while fiscal policy remains contractionary The central bank began easing monetary policy in early autumn 2024 and has cut the key interest rate to 7.5% by May 2025. It is projected to be lowered further throughout 2025 and more gradually thereafter, to around 5% by end-2026. The trade-weighted exchange rate has appreciated since early 2025, largely due to a weaker USD. Fiscal policy, as indicated by the underlying primary balance, will be tightened further by approximately 1.4% of GDP in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026. These measures will help alleviate inflationary pressures and build fiscal space. Gross public debt will decline further as the government-owned Housing Financing Fund is wound down. The economy is set to recover gradually The economy is projected to grow by 1.4% in 2025 and 2.8% in 2026. Private consumption will expand, driven by real wage increases. Residential investment will remain robust, supported by improving financial conditions and sustained housing demand. Business investment is projected to grow as confidence rises and financial conditions continue to ease. Export growth will be broad-based but moderate as foreign tourism will expand modestly, while aluminium production remains largely unaffected by higher tariffs with smelters operating at full capacity. The unemployment rate will rise to above 4% in 2025 and stabilise thereafter.

However, it could exceed expectations if import prices, especially for food and oil, begin to rise again. Escalating trade tensions could strangle goods exports and dent tourism if disposable incomes decline in the countries raising tariffs. Volcanic activity on the Reykjanes peninsula and near the capital area could cause further infrastructure damage and require additional public relief spending. Reforming the fiscal framework would strengthen public finances Replacing the current budget balance rule with a structural spending rule could mitigate pro-cyclical fiscal policy, enhancing the stability and sustainability of public finances. The introduction of resource taxes, including the planned reform of fishing fees and the implementation of a new visitor tax, will support the sustainable management of natural resources. Eliminating exemptions in the value-added tax, particularly by reinstating the standard VAT rate on tourism services, will reduce distortions within the tax system. Lowering barriers to market entry will encourage investment. Easing the licensing and permit system for various professions and accelerating further the recognition of foreign diplomas will help to boost productivity and alleviate labour shortages. 176  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 India Real GDP is projected to grow by 6.3% in fiscal year 2025-26 and 6.4% in 2026-27. Private consumption will gradually strengthen, driven by rising real incomes that are helped by moderate inflation, recent tax cuts and a strengthening of the labour market. Investment will be supported by declining interest rates and substantial public capital spending, but higher US tariffs will weigh on exports. Inflation will remain contained at around 4% as economic activity grows around trend. A less benign monsoon season or higher global commodity prices could drive up food prices and inflation. The Union Budget for the fiscal year 2025–26 foresees a moderate fiscal consolidation, aiming to reduce the headline budget deficit from 4.8% of GDP in fiscal year 2024-25 to 4.4% in 2025-26. With inflation firmly within the target range, monetary policy is gradually expected to become more accommodative. Better targeting of energy and fertiliser subsidies, and an overhaul of tax expenditures, could enhance spending efficiency and free resources for other policy priorities. Improving logistics efficiency, upgrading digital infrastructure, and enhancing policy predictability, particularly in tax administration, could bolster private investment. Domestic demand supports activity Real GDP expanded by 6.2% year-on-year in the third quarter of FY2024-25, supported by robust domestic demand and strong investment. High-frequency indicators suggest that economic activity remained solid in the fourth quarter. Industrial production rose by 3.7% year-on-year in the first four months of 2025, with the manufacturing sector regaining strength. India’s current account deficit widened in the first three quarters of FY2024-25, due to a persistent merchandise trade deficit that was only partially offset by strong services exports. More recent data suggest a slight improvement in the trade balance. The labour market was resilient in 2024 with the labour force participation rate increasing to 45.1% and employment continuing to rise. Survey data from early 2025 show optimism in the labour market, especially in sectors such as information technology, retail, and finance. Monetary conditions remain restrictive, despite policy rate cuts in February and April. Headline inflation eased to 3.2% in April 2025 and is now within the central bank’s target range of 4% ± 2%, largely due to a substantial moderation in food inflation, which accounts for nearly half of the CPI basket, and declining energy prices. Easing food prices reflect a strong autumn harvest, and government interventions, such as export restrictions. As a major oil importer, India has benefited from lower global crude oil prices in recent months, which reduced domestic fuel costs and helped contain input costs in energy-intensive sectors such as transport, manufacturing, and agriculture. While core inflation remains slightly above 4%, wage growth remains moderate. High merchandise export exposure to the United States, which is India’s largest export market, increases the vulnerability of private investment to shifts in trade policy. Tariff increases and broader trade tensions may damp investor sentiment, particularly in export-oriented sectors such as chemicals, textiles, and electronics. However, the overall GDP effects will be limited by the moderate share of exports in GDP, with merchandise exports towards the United States accounting for only 2.1% of GDP.  177 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 India 1 1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/1e0bsf Monetary policy is expected to ease amid rising public investment The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its current easing cycle in February 2025, followed by a second policy rate cut in April. Despite the cumulative 50 basis point reduction, which lowered the policy rate from 6.5% to 6.0%, financial conditions remain tight. Monetary policy is expected to ease further over FY2025– 26 as headline inflation remains within the target range over 2025 due to the moderation of food and energy prices, which make up a large share of the consumer price index. Low global commodity prices and a broadly balanced output gap are helping to contain demand-side pressures. In addition, the credibility of the RBI’s inflation-targeting framework continues to anchor inflation expectations. With headline inflation expected to remain within the target range in the following years and inflation expectations projected to remain anchored, there is scope for the central bank to reduce the policy rate towards a more neutral level. A further 25-basis point cut is expected by the end of 2025. The central government is expected to pursue fiscal consolidation, bringing the budget deficit from 4.8% of GDP in FY 2024-25 to 4.4% in FY 2025-26, with local governments projected to adopt a similar stance. The adjustment relies primarily on higher revenues. Although the recently approved Union Budget includes income tax cuts for middle-income households, overall tax revenues are projected to increase by 0.3% of GDP, partly reflecting the positive impact of tax code simplification and digitalisation on compliance. On the expenditure side, total spending is set to decline by 0.1% of GDP, largely reflecting reduced subsidies. Public capital expenditure and defence spending are maintained at their current levels as a share of GDP. Private demand will drive growth amid emerging external headwinds Real GDP is projected to grow by 6.3% in FY2025-26 and 6.4% in FY2026-27. Private consumption is supported by rising real incomes and lower personal income taxes. Investment will remain strong, bolstered by easing financial conditions. However, export growth is expected to slow due to weaker global demand, the impact of higher tariffs and heightened trade policy uncertainty. Headline inflation is projected to average 4.1% in FY2025-26 and 4.0% in FY2026-27. Inflation expectations remain well anchored, and wage pressures are expected to remain contained with the economy projected to grow around potential, suggesting limited demand-driven inflation pressures.  179 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The balance of risks is tilted to the downside. The summer monsoon is projected to be normal. A less benign monsoon would reduce agricultural output and rural incomes, push up food prices, and weigh on GDP. The agricultural sector accounts for over 15% of GDP and employs a large share of the population. Additionally, the risk of increased trade tensions, including the imposition of higher US tariffs on Indian exports, could dampen external demand and harm export-oriented sectors such as textiles, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Trade tensions may also discourage private investment in tradable sectors. Stronger-than-expected remittances and investment inflows, coupled with robust infrastructure implementation, could lift growth above current projections. Fiscal prudence and reforms are important to sustain growth Phasing out tax expenditures, rationalising subsidies, and expanding tax bases would improve the quality and sustainability of public finances, creating room for expanding social protection, higher public investment, and active labour market policies. Emphasis should be placed on policies that raise labour force participation, especially among women. Although female employment has increased markedly, from 17.5% in FY2017–18 to 31.7% in FY2023–24, strengthening women’s access to formal jobs will require coordinated reforms in childcare availability, safe and affordable transportation, skill-building, and enforcement of workplace protections. India has scope to accelerate trade liberalisation, simplify customs procedures, and reduce tariffs. Further reforms are needed to improve the efficiency of logistics networks, upgrade digital infrastructure, and reduce regulatory uncertainty, especially in tax administration. Enhancing the availability and accessibility of long-term finance, including through deepening capital markets and improving credit access for SMEs, would further strengthen the investment climate. 180  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Indonesia Real GDP is projected to grow by 4.7% in 2025 and 4.8% in 2026. Low inflation and easing financial conditions will spur private consumption and investment. However, uncertainty about domestic fiscal policy will temper these gains, while export growth is expected to slow amid global trade tensions. Inflation is projected to pick up to 2.3% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, as the recent depreciation of the currency gradually feeds into domestic prices. The current account deficit is expected to widen modestly, but a further decline in commodity prices could exacerbate this by driving down export revenues. Monetary policy is expected to continue to ease over 2025 and 2026, as inflationary pressures remain contained amid soft growth. Fiscal policy is projected to be broadly neutral in 2025, as increased spending on a free meals programme and additional public investment through the new sovereign wealth fund (“Danantara”) will be financed by spending cuts elsewhere. Reducing regulatory barriers to foreign investment and raising the efficiency of public spending through improved targeting of social benefits to vulnerable households are key medium-term policy priorities. Reducing informality would help improve social protection and raise tax revenues. The economy is going through a soft patch Annual seasonally unadjusted real GDP growth slowed to 4.9% in the first quarter of 2025, amid soft investment, stable household consumption and a positive contribution from net exports. While the unemployment rate declined to 4.8% in the first quarter of 2025, among the lowest values in two decades, the economy appears to have slowed, as consumer and business sentiment deteriorated and prices of key export commodities declined. Low inflation is supporting real household incomes, but high borrowing costs continue to weigh on investment. Inflation has come down from around 6% in the second half of 2022 to 2% in April 2025, on the back of monetary policy tightening, the normalisation of food and commodity prices and a temporary electricity price discount in January and February of 2025. The phase-out of the price discount and the depreciation of the currency – around 4% relative to the US dollar since the beginning of the year – will put upward pressure on prices in the near term, but core inflation remains close to the mid-point of the central bank’s target band of 1.5-3.5% and inflation expectations are stable. Exposure to higher US import tariffs is relatively limited, with goods exports to the United States amounting to less than 2% of GDP.  181 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Indonesia 1 1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/t3cdvl Macroeconomic policies are becoming less restrictive Monetary policy is expected to ease over 2025-26. The central bank initiated the ongoing easing cycle in August 2024, bringing the policy rate from 6.25% to 5.5% in May, but financial conditions remain restrictive. With stable inflation expectations and domestic demand growth projected to be below trend, there is room for the central bank to further reduce the policy rate towards a more neutral level of around 5%. Pursuing a data-dependent approach that balances support to economic growth and close monitoring of price pressures from the recent currency depreciation is key to durably maintain inflation within the central bank’s target band. The government budget deficit is expected to increase from 2.3% of GDP in 2024 to 2.8% in 2025. The expansion of a free meals programme for schoolchildren and pregnant women and the creation of a new sovereign wealth fund, as well as foregone revenue from a temporary electricity price discount in early 2025 will put upward pressure of around 1.6% of GDP on the budget deficit. This will be mitigated by across-the-board spending cuts amounting to around 1.3% of GDP, which will maintain the budget deficit below the statutory limit of 3% of GDP. Despite the rising budget deficit, the fiscal policy stance will be neutral in 2025, as only part of the funds transferred to the new sovereign wealth fund will translate into new public investment outlays in 2025. Accelerating disbursements from the new sovereign wealth fund in the near term while ensuring transparency and accountability in its management would support growth in 2025, which appears appropriate amid rising uncertainty about the growth outlook. Gradually raising government revenue from 2026 would put public debt – which is currently around 40% of GDP – on a declining path. Growth is expected to slow in the near term Real GDP growth is expected to slow to 4.7% in 2025 before picking up slightly to 4.8% in 2026. The recent weakening of business and consumer sentiment amid fiscal policy uncertainty and high borrowing costs will weigh on private consumption and investment in the first half of 2025. As financial conditions gradually ease, inflation remains comfortably within the central bank’s target band, and public investment outlays  183 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 from the new sovereign wealth fund gather momentum, domestic demand is expected to gradually increase over the second half of 2025 and 2026. The recent escalation of global trade tensions and the decline in commodity prices are expected to weigh on external demand and export revenues. Inflation is expected to gradually rise to the mid-point of the central bank’s target range, as the effects of the temporary electricity price discount at the beginning of 2025 fade, and the recent depreciation of the currency gradually feeds into domestic prices. Risks are tilted to the downside. Persistent capital outflows driven by global and domestic policy uncertainty could place renewed pressure on the currency, potentially leading to a temporary widening of the current account deficit and fuelling inflation through higher import costs. Additionally, a larger-than-expected slowdown in China – Indonesia’s largest export market – would further weigh on export performance, particularly in commodity sectors. On the upside, swift and effective deployment of the newly established sovereign wealth fund could catalyse private investment by crowding in capital and accelerate the implementation of high-impact infrastructure and industrial projects. Structural reforms are needed to boost growth Recent reforms have reduced barriers to foreign investment, but significant barriers to foreign equity ownership remain, especially in the telecommunications and transportation sectors. Moreover, the investment climate is affected by overlapping regulations, uneven policy implementation, and limited coordination among government agencies. Further reforms in this area will become increasingly relevant in the context of global trade policy uncertainty and the potential reconfiguration of supply chains. Addressing infant malnutrition through the free meals programme will strengthen public health, but improved targeting to vulnerable households would ensure that funds are spent more efficiently. Reforms to reduce informality would help broaden the tax base and create fiscal space for the expansion of public investment, including transport infrastructure and clean energy, as well as health and education spending. Shifting the funding of maternity leave from employers to social insurance, in particular for smaller firms and self-employed women, would help raise female labour force participation. 184  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Ireland GDP growth is projected to be 3.7% in 2025, before moderating to 2.3% in 2026, as trade fragmentation weighs on export-oriented sectors. On the domestic side, heightened uncertainty will encourage households to save more, despite sustained nominal wage growth underpinned by a tight labour market. Modified domestic demand, which controls for the major distortions arising from the activity of multinationals, is projected to expand by 2.2% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026, below its long-term average of 2.7%. As the United States is Ireland’s biggest export market and multinationals play a large role in Irish exports and tax revenues, higher tariffs or non-tariff trade barriers would lower growth and exacerbate medium-term fiscal challenges. Prioritising productivity-enhancing reforms, spending efficiency, and stricter domestic fiscal controls will be key. Planned infrastructure investment should be implemented, albeit properly sequenced to avoid adding to inflation. The strong labour market shores up the domestic economy According to preliminary estimates, GDP grew strongly by 3.2% in the first quarter of 2025, mainly reflecting strong exports of pharmaceuticals despite considerable global uncertainty. Amidst persistent population growth, the labour market was robust in early 2025, with strong job creation and low unemployment. After easing considerably in late 2024, headline inflation bounced back to 2.0% in April, driven mostly by food prices, while stronger services price growth pushed core inflation up to 2.4%. Consumer spending rebounded by end-2024, driven by sustained wage growth underpinned by labour shortages. Buoyant VAT revenues indicate ongoing strength in private consumption in early 2025. Going forward, tariff-related uncertainties will weigh on consumer confidence. Ireland 1. Deflated by the harmonised index of consumer prices.

An extension of the tariff to currently exempt pharmaceuticals, or a tightening of non-tariff barriers on services trade, could weigh heavily on growth. Exports of pharmaceuticals – largely from US-owned multinationals – to the United States, Ireland’s largest single export market, surged to EUR 44 billion in 2024, out of total goods exports of EUR 73 billion. Multinational\u0002dominated trade with the United States in intellectual property products, computer, and business services accounts for about 25% of Ireland’s services trade. Public spending pressures are mounting Looming risks warrant greater fiscal prudence. Underlying tax revenue growth remained strong in early 2025. As Budget 2025 measures – worth 2.0% of 2024 GDP; 3.6% of GNI* – are being rolled out, public spending is surging. In addition to higher public investment and a set of loosely targeted new cost-of-living initiatives, the package includes permanent current spending increases and tax measures to offset income threshold effects. Higher spending and weaker tax revenues due to second-round effects from the 10% tariff on US goods imports from the European Union, and the further extension of reduced VAT rates on electricity and gas to end-October 2025, will lower the budget surplus to 1.3% of GDP (2.2% of GNI*) in 2025. The fiscal stance is slightly expansionary in the projection period, even assuming no income-support measures in 2026. Gross public debt is projected to fall close to 60% of GNI* (36% of GDP) by 2026. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Ireland Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 448.1 8.7 -5.6 1.2 3.7 2.3 Private consumption 105.4 10.9 4.3 2.3 2.2 1.9 Government consumption 52.6 4.1 5.5 4.2 3.0 2.4 Gross fixed capital formation 98.8 4.2 2.8 -25.8 19.7 3.1 Final domestic demand 256.8 7.3 3.9 -7.1 7.7 2.4 Stockbuilding¹ 5.1 0.8 1.3 -3.1 -1.8 0.0 Total domestic demand 261.9 7.9 5.7 -12.0 3.2 2.5 Exports of goods and services 597.0 13.6 -6.0 11.9 3.9 3.2 Imports of goods and services 410.8 16.4 1.3 6.5 4.1 3.1 Net exports¹ 186.2 3.1 -9.5 9.4 1.5 1.4 Memorandum items _ 9.1 2.7 2.6 2.2 2.1 _ 6.9 4.0 2.8 2.6 2.8 _ 8.1 5.2 1.3 2.1 2.0 _ 4.6 4.4 2.3 2.3 2.1 _ 4.4 4.3 4.2 4.4 4.6 _ 10.5 9.3 9.8 11.1 11.2 _ 1.7 1.5 4.4 1.3 0.9 _ 45.4 46.2 41.3 38.2 36.0 _ 43.2 43.2 41.1 38.0 35.8 _ 8.8 8.1 17.2 14.1 13.7 Percentage changes, volume (2022 prices) Modified final domestic demand², volume GDP deflator Harmonised index of core inflation³ Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) Current account balance (% of GDP) 2.

Hence, modified domestic demand is projected to expand by just over 2% annually through 2026, though GDP growth is projected at 3.7% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026. Higher input costs and services prices will push headline inflation up to 2.1% in 2025, despite milder energy price pressures, while core inflation will reach 2.3%, before both ease slightly in 2026. Given the key role of a few large foreign\u0002owned multinationals in export-oriented sectors, like pharmaceuticals or advanced computer and business services, higher general or industry-specific tariffs or non-tariff barriers could lower growth and adversely impact fiscal balances. On the upside, manufacturing multinationals’ significant sunk investments in both labour and capital equipment may help mitigate the impact of tariffs on growth. Amid significant skills shortages, the employment correction to the shock might be softened by firms’ reluctance to shed staff. Tackling infrastructure bottlenecks remains a priority Higher investment in housing, transport and energy infrastructure is essential to maintain foreign investor confidence and preserve living standards. While tariffs could lower corporate and personal income tax revenues, excess corporate tax receipts should continue to be allocated to the long-term savings funds, which are intended to address ageing-related costs and support medium-term productivity-enhancing investment. Additionally, greater emphasis should be placed on improving spending efficiency – supported by comprehensive spending reviews, stricter domestic fiscal guard-rails, and better-targeted income support where needed. Boosting work incentives in the tax and benefit system, alongside improving the supply of quality vocational pathways for low-skilled workers, could help alleviate labour and skills shortages. Easing SMEs’ access to R&D funding and to tailored lifelong learning programmes, via the National Training Fund, could help foster domestic investment in digitalisation and innovation, and result in more even productivity gains.  187 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Israel Economic activity is on a path to expand by 3.3% in 2025 and by 4.9% in 2026. The ceasefire in Lebanon at the end of 2024 brought a significant improvement in the economic environment spurring exports and private consumption. With a tight labour market and lingering supply constraints, inflation is anticipated to remain high at 3.2% in 2025 before moderating to 2.9% in 2026. Risks are substantial, hinging on regional geopolitical developments. Implementing the fiscal consolidation planned for 2025-2026 is important to secure fiscal sustainability while creating buffers. Monetary policy must remain tight to ensure that inflation durably falls back within the 1-3% target range. Strong population growth necessitates investment in physical and education infrastructure accompanied by reforms to remove regulatory barriers and restructure the education system so that it can deliver high-quality teaching for all. The recovery is accelerating The economic recovery has gathered strength since the ceasefire in Lebanon at the end of 2024, with GDP expanding at an annualised rate of 3.4% in the first quarter of 2025. By removing most of the threat of rocket fire over the north and centre of the country, the ceasefire strongly improved the economic environment with long-term bond yields consequently falling by more than half a percentage point since October 2024. Foreign airlines returned to the Tel Aviv airport, facilitating international business and a recovery of high-tech investment. The improvement in living conditions enabled consumption to remain strong. Despite the one-percentage point VAT rise at the start of 2025, credit card purchases by March 2025 overtook their level in December 2024, which had been boosted by advance buying ahead of the VAT increase.

Tariffs on the 28% of Israeli merchandise exports that ship to the United States average below 7%. Services, which make up much of Israel’s exports to the United States, remain outside the scope of the new US tariffs. The effective exchange rate appreciation since October 2024 is also reducing import price inflation. Imports of goods are also facilitated by the “What’s good for Europe is good for Israel” reform, whereby goods meeting EU standards across a wide range of categories are deemed compliant with Israeli standards. Macroeconomic policy is adequately tight The fiscal stance is set to tighten in 2025 and 2026. After rising from 4.2% of GDP in 2022 to 8.0% in 2024, military expenditure will fall, albeit to a higher level than before October 2023. Simultaneously, government receipts are poised to rise in 2025-2026 following the VAT rate increase, the new tax on undistributed profits of some holding companies, the increase in national insurance contributions, the freeze of personal income tax brackets and other revenue-generating measures. Despite this fiscal tightening and the currency appreciation, monetary policy is expected to remain restrictive as, at 3.6% in April 2025, inflation lies above the 1-3% target range, while the labour market remains very tight with 2.7% unemployment in April 2025. Furthermore, persistent labour shortages in construction constrain supply. The private sector is set to drive growth Activity is set to expand by 3.3% in 2025 and 4.9% in 2026 under the impetus of private consumption and exports.

Risks are large but balanced. On the upside, a peaceful settlement of ongoing conflicts would reduce sovereign risk. New diplomatic agreements with countries in the region would durably boost trade. On the downside, broader regional conflict could result in economic contraction and a large widening of fiscal deficits. Deepening unrest in relation with judicial reform plans could also derail high-tech dynamism, especially if it involved significant high-skilled labour emigration. Forward-looking economic management is paramount Macroeconomic policy needs to remain prudent to keep the economy on track for a balanced recovery. Besides maintaining the revenue-raising instruments already deployed, the government should lower transfers and subsidies that can discourage labour market participation. Monetary policy needs to remain restrictive until inflation is set to come durably into the target range. Looking ahead, strong demographic growth calls for substantial investment in physical capital, to address infrastructure gaps, and in education, to maintain the strong skills base that the high-tech sector and the rest of the economy require to reap the dividends of AI and digitisation. In addition, infrastructure and education both require structural reforms to remove unnecessary regulatory obstacles to entry, competition and investment and ensure that the education system works well for pupils across population groups. 190  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Italy GDP growth is expected to slow slightly to 0.6% in 2025 and pick up to 0.7% in 2026. Global trade policy disruptions are expected to drag on growth. Higher real wages are set to support consumer demand. Investment will be boosted by accelerated implementation of National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) projects. Export volumes are poised to stagnate in 2025 due to more restrictive trade policy settings and sluggish demand in key European markets. Downside risks dominate, including the uncertain response of investors and employers to global policy developments. Faster implementation of NRRP projects or stronger export demand from other European countries would bolster growth. Continuing fiscal consolidation is projected in 2025 and 2026, as the government remains committed to reducing the fiscal deficit and putting the public finances on a sustainable medium-term path. Progress implementing the NRRP should encourage greater private investment and employment in the medium term. Sustaining living standards in the longer term will require improving opportunities for graduating youth and older workers to update their skills to meet the needs of the labour market. Weaker industrial production has weighed on GDP growth GDP expanded by 0.7% in 2024, with weak growth in the second half of the year. Export volumes fell. Industrial production was 1.8% lower in March 2025 than a year earlier and has fallen for over two years. The weakness is broadly-based, with motor vehicles and parts production especially weak. Investment has been dragged by lower housing construction with the winding-down of the generous Superbonus building tax credit from early 2024. Private consumption was buoyed by support to disposable incomes from rising employment and wages and moderate underlying inflation. The unemployment rate was 6% in March 2025, near its lowest rate since prior to the global financial crisis. Italy is exposed to more restrictive US trade policy through higher tariffs on EU goods. Over 10% of Italy’s total goods exports in 2023 went to the United States. Moreover, the indirect effects may be significant, for example through global motor vehicle production chains or weaker demand globally. Italy is also exposed to growing competition from Chinese industrial products. Volatility in international energy prices has been transmitted into consumer prices. Higher gas prices in early 2025 contributed to headline inflation rising to 2.0% in the year to April 2025. In response, the government introduced a new support programme targeting lower income households. The fall in gas and petroleum prices in March and April 2025 is passing into producer and consumer prices.  191 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Italy 1 Source: Istat; and OECD Economic Outlook 117 database.

A modest reduction is projected for 2025 and further consolidation in 2026, in line with the medium-term structural fiscal plan submitted to the European Commission. These are projected to reduce the headline budget deficit by 0.6% of GDP. The ramp-down in spending on the building tax credit is supporting consolidation, alongside positive revenue developments and some savings in ministries’ spending. The government expects these to be sufficient to offset planned income tax cuts and tax bracket consolidation, as well as planned increases in spending, including on health care and investment. The government also plans small increases in defence and national security spending, and to accelerate public investment spending, although this will mainly be in 2026. The improvement in the budget balance may be more modest than the government’s projections given the weakening growth outlook and increased pressures for defence and other spending. Italy has continued to make progress on implementing the reforms in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and spending rates have increased. Lower euro area interest rates are passing into lending and deposit rates. Household borrowing demand started rising in early 2025, although businesses continued to reduce their borrowing. Long-term government bond yields were broadly stable from mid-2024 to May 2025, while spreads relative to equivalent German government bond yields declined to about 105 basis points in mid-May 2025, after averaging around 125 basis points over the previous six months. Still, the government expects the interest cost of public debt to rise. Global trade policy developments will drag on the recovery in GDP growth Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 0.6% in 2025 and pick-up slightly to 0.7% in 2026. New global trade restrictions are expected to result in export volumes contracting slightly in 2026 – the first contraction since the global financial crisis (excluding the pandemic). Exports are expected to resume growing in 2026 as other European countries increase their investment and defence spending. Consumer demand is expected to remain resilient, despite the increased economic uncertainty, as real wages are supported by  193 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 firm employment and wage growth and moderate inflation. Investment is set to grow with the accelerating disbursement of NextGenerationEU-funded projects, while residential construction spending returns to longer-term average levels with the withdrawal of the Superbonus tax credits. Other business investment is poised to remain weak, despite lower financing costs, due to uncertainty over the global economic and policy environment. Headline inflation is set to ease as the increase in energy and fresh food prices fades, while underlying inflation will rise moderately with ongoing wage growth. Risks to growth are tilted to the downside due to the uncertainty created by global trade policy developments. New or retaliatory trade restrictions or more prolonged weakness in demand in the euro area may lead to a deeper contraction in exports than expected. Uncertainty over policy may lead to firms cutting investment and recruitment plans by more than expected and households cutting their expenditure to build precautionary savings. On the upside, more of the public investment projects funded through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) could be implemented than expected over 2025 and 2026. Raising the economy’s potential while proceeding with fiscal consolidation will support investment Achieving the planned fiscal consolidation will be necessary to ensure public debt is on a prudent path and to contain interest expenses. The high share of spending on pensions and rising spending pressures from ageing, climate and defence needs in the medium term requires significant reforms. Raising property taxes and addressing tax evasion, and containing pension spending despite demographic pressures, can create room for public investment. Ensuring effective and timely disbursement of NextGenerationEU-funded projects will boost near-term demand and improve the investment climate into the longer-term. Simplifying the authorisation procedures for renewable energy and associated electricity grid investments would reduce the dependence on natural gas, lower energy costs and accelerate electrification. Bolstering the labour force will be central for private investment prospects. Improving school leavers’ readiness for the workforce, such as by boosting apprenticeships and advanced technical education, would help support the size and skills of the workforce, and improve the attractiveness of staying in Italy for young adults. Women’s participation would be raised by continuing to expand public support for care for children and other dependents. Expanding access to reskilling opportunities for adults to extend their working lives will also help address demographic challenges and the labour force’s needs. 194  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Japan Real GDP growth is projected at 0.7% in 2025, despite significant headwinds, before reverting towards potential in 2026, at 0.4%. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. Private consumption is set to increase as robust wage growth boosts households’ disposable income. Expanding profits and government subsidies, especially for green and digital investment, will support business investment, despite higher uncertainty. External demand will exert a drag on growth, reflecting the higher US tariffs. A surge in food prices will slightly raise headline consumer price inflation in 2025, before it eases towards the 2% target in 2026. Inflation above target over the past three years and robust wage growth warrant continued gradual policy interest rate increases, but high uncertainty calls for close monitoring and a data-driven pace. The primary fiscal balance is projected to improve absent additional supplementary budgets, which should be limited to large shocks. To increase fiscal buffers to address shocks and ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability, a medium-term fiscal consolidation path is needed amid rising debt servicing costs. Structural reforms to boost productivity, including labour-saving and labour-augmenting investment, and employment are key to address demographic headwinds and raise potential growth. Robust profits and wage growth are supporting domestic demand While GDP contracted in the first quarter of 2025, domestic demand grew robustly. Business investment increased, supported by high corporate profits, and the order backlog of machinery rose to record highs. The Bank of Japan’s March Tankan Survey, which did not fully factor in the impact of US tariffs, pointed to robust future investment plans. Consumption remained flat in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting declining consumer confidence amidst high inflation, despite rising nominal wages and strong labour market performance. Annual headline consumer price inflation was 3.6% in April, due to sticky food inflation, despite the resumption of electricity and city gas subsidies between January and March. The outcome of the ongoing annual wage negotiations for FY2025, with a 3.8% base pay increase as of 2 May, is stronger than last year. Japan 1 1. As of 2 May. The horizontal axis shows fiscal years.

The impact on the Japanese economy will be direct, as for example automobile exports to the United Stares are high at 6% of total exports, and indirect through higher uncertainty and lower global growth. The projections assume no trade policy retaliation by Japan. Imports and inventories grew strongly in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting precautionary behaviour by firms in the face of higher trade uncertainty. Inbound tourism has expanded robustly, driven primarily by tourists from China. Macroeconomic support is projected to gradually decrease In January, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised the policy interest rate from around 0.25% to around 0.5%, the highest level in 17 years. The BoJ’s reduction of its monthly purchases of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) by around JPY 400 billion each quarter, targeting about JPY 3 trillion by the first quarter of 2026 and roughly a 7-8% reduction in JGB holdings by March 2026, has been proceeding smoothly. Corporate inflation expectations have risen moderately to 2.5%, 2.4%, and 2.3% at the one-, three-, and five-year horizons, respectively, according to the Tankan Survey. Given inflation and wage developments, monetary accommodation should continue to be withdrawn gradually, with the policy rate projected to reach 1¼ per cent during the latter half of 2026. High uncertainty calls for close monitoring and a data-driven pace to monetary policy normalisation. The underlying primary deficit is projected to decrease from 1.5% of GDP in 2024 to 0.6% in 2026, assuming no supplementary budgets in FY2025 and FY2026, helped by fiscal consolidation in both years. OECD projections assume an increase in public investment to mitigate the impact of future disasters by 0.2% of GDP in FY2026, and additional expenditures on high school tuition assistance by 0.1% of GDP and defence spending by 0.2% of GDP in FY2025-2026. On the other hand, the corporate tax rate will be increased by 4 percentage points in April 2026 to partly finance increased defence spending. Subsidies for electricity and city gas bills will be resumed between July and September 2025. Given lower oil prices, the projections assume that the gasoline price subsidy will be phased out at the end of 2025. The gross public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decrease from 227% in 2023 to 213% in 2026, as nominal growth surpasses debt servicing costs. Domestic demand will drive growth but faces significant risks Real GDP is projected to grow by 0.7% and 0.4% in 2025 and 2026, respectively, driven by domestic demand. Strong wage growth will support private consumption. Despite headwinds from uncertainty, business investment is projected to remain robust in 2025, reflecting high corporate profits, a large order backlog in machinery and government subsidies. Higher trade restrictions, weaker global demand and elevated uncertainty about trading partner trade policies will weigh on exports, moderating growth. Headline consumer price inflation is projected to edge up to 2.8% in 2025, before converging to the 2% target in 2026 as food inflation slows. Risks are tilted to the downside. Weaker-than-expected external demand and abrupt changes in financial markets would lower growth. A large and rapid appreciation of the yen could reduce corporate profits and wage increases, leading to lower-than-projected private consumption and investment. Abrupt changes in bond and equity prices could destabilise financial markets and hurt the balance sheets of private financial institutions, the government, and the public pension funds. Interest rates on long-dated Japanese government bonds have already surged to record highs in May. A loss of confidence in Japan’s fiscal sustainability and an increase in the sovereign risk premium could also adversely affect the financial sector and the real economy. The main upside risk is higher-than-projected exports due to a rapid reconstruction  197 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 of international supply chains, the establishment of new export channels or an agreement with the United States on tariffs. Rebuilding fiscal buffers and boosting potential growth are priorities A higher interest bill and expenditure pressures related to spending on health and long-term care for an ageing population will exacerbate medium-term fiscal sustainability challenges. A medium-term fiscal consolidation path needs to be spelled out and adhered to, underpinned by concrete revenue and expenditure measures. Supplementary budgets should only be used in the event of large shocks. Additional potential support against the high cost-of-living or tariffs could derail fiscal consolidation and, if implemented, should be targeted and temporary. Misallocation of capital and labour and population ageing have weighed on investment and total factor productivity growth during the past decade. Reforms to improve the innovation framework and incentives for start-ups, such as redesigning the R&D tax credit and strengthening the links between universities and SMEs, would boost productivity growth and investment in new technologies and digitalisation. Investing in labour-saving and labour-augmenting technologies, as well as re-skilling and upskilling to address changing skill needs, are also key. Higher labour mobility can also boost knowledge transfer and productivity growth. Reforms to boost the labour supply of older, female, and migrant workers should also be continued to address demographic headwinds. 198  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Korea GDP growth is projected to weaken to 1.0% in 2025 before picking up to 2.2% in 2026. Increased tariffs and uncertainty are set to hold back export growth and weaken business investment. Private consumption should pick up from late 2025 as domestic political uncertainty subsides and real wages continue to rise. Inflation will remain close to target. Increased female and elderly labour market participation will raise employment, and unemployment is set to edge down in 2026. The Bank of Korea cut the policy rate to 2.75% in February and is expected to lower it further to 2.0% in 2025 amid weak demand. The partial reversal of large revenue shortfalls in 2023 and 2024 will contribute to the planned fiscal consolidation in 2025. Any additional fiscal support should be complemented by a sustainable long-term fiscal framework. Labour market reform can boost growth, reduce elderly poverty and lessen the high opportunity cost of motherhood. Confidence is tested by an uncertain environment The martial law declaration on 3 December 2024 dealt a blow to already weak domestic demand. Consumer and business confidence have been subpar. GDP contracted in the first quarter of 2025, largely driven by temporary factors holding back business and housing investment. Confidence will be boosted by the resolution of the presidential impeachment case, but uncertainty related to tariffs and international trade pulls in the opposite direction. Employment bottomed out in late 2024, and unemployment is falling back from a recent peak. Retail sales volumes have fallen in early 2025. Housing prices and construction orders have been sliding. Recent inflation readings are largely in line with the 2% target, with headline inflation at 2.1% and core inflation at 2.4% in April. Korea 1. Quarterly averages.

The Government will pursue negotiations and is not expected to respond by raising tariffs on the United States in the near term. Customs exports flatlined in the first quarter of 2025, contrary to expectations of an increase driven by front-loading ahead of the imposition of tariffs. Monetary policy is easing while the fiscal stance remains restrictive The Bank of Korea cut the policy rate to 2.75% in February, keeping the stance slightly restrictive. Further cuts totalling 75 basis points are expected in the course of 2025 to boost domestic demand and counteract the drag on growth from increased tariffs and uncertainty. Thereafter, the policy rate is assumed to remain at 2% until the end of 2026. A supplementary spending package of 0.1% of GDP has been legislated, with spending expected to be front-loaded in the second quarter. Fiscal policy is assumed to be restrictive, with consolidation of 1.1% of GDP over 2025-26, notably due to a partial reversal of the weak corporate income tax receipts over the past two years. Tariffs and uncertainty hold back growth GDP is set to grow by 1.0% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026. Household consumption will gather strength gradually, supported by rising real incomes and improving labour market conditions. Business and housing investments are set to bounce back from the second quarter of 2025. Inflation is on course to remain around the 2% target.

Fiscal support may also be appropriate in the short term, but public debt has increased rapidly over the past few years, while reducing budget deficits according to plans has proved difficult. The agreement between the government and opposition on additional spending should therefore be followed by a bipartisan commitment to placing the public finances on a sustainable path going forward. Lowering barriers to trade and foreign direct investment, combined with growth-friendly fiscal measures such as environmental taxes, increased auctioning in the emissions trading scheme and streamlining of state support to companies could strengthen investment. Reforming the labour market to reduce duality, move decisively from seniority-based to performance-based wage setting and systematically enforce legislation against discrimination, can boost growth, lower elderly poverty and lessen the high opportunity cost of motherhood.  201 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Latvia Real GDP is projected to grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. High inflation and rising geopolitical uncertainty are bearing down on the recovery of private consumption and investment. Increasing public investment will gradually strengthen domestic demand, while export demand is weakened by rising global trade barriers. Core inflation will remain high due to strong wage growth related to labour shortages. Further delays in the absorption of EU funds could adversely affect the recovery in domestic demand. Increasing revenue and reallocating spending to finance the strengthening of defence capacity are key to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability. Improved capacity for infrastructure planning and policy impact evaluation would help increase spending efficiency. Listing large state-owned enterprises could help deepen capital markets and improve access to finance for firms. Reducing the labour tax wedge for low-income earners and shifting the tax burden towards other income, property and environmental taxes would help lower informality. Strengthening competition enforcement and addressing skills shortages by improving training opportunities and facilitating skilled immigration would support business dynamism, innovation and investment. Weak confidence and slow absorption of EU funds have weighed on growth GDP has stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2024. Private consumption fell due to low confidence and a surge in food price inflation, despite strong wage growth in the fourth quarter. Slow absorption of EU funds has weighed on public and private investment, despite easing financing conditions. Industrial production fell by 2% in March compared to February and was about 2½ per cent lower than a year earlier. Annual inflation rose from 3.5% in March to 4% in April due to rising food prices, and core inflation increased to 4.2%, reflecting strong wage growth and high services price inflation. The unemployment rate was 6.7% in March, and the vacancy rate was 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting increased shortages of technicians, professionals and managers. Declining relative import prices and an increase in demand for defence equipment contributed to import volumes, which increased by 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter. Exports increased by 2.2% over the quarter, particularly driven by IT and business services. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed in the first quarter of 2025 but widened in March due to a rapid rise in import values. Although less than 3% of goods and services exports go to the United States, tariff increases could hurt exports in industries such as wood, wood products and electronics. Mortgage rates have fallen about 190 basis points from a year ago, supported by euro area monetary easing and recent reforms to strengthen competition in financial markets that reduced refinancing costs. 202  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Latvia Note: Core inflation refers to the harmonised index of consumer prices excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco.

EU Recovery and Resilience Facility grants will finance public investment and measures to improve training and digital adoption in small businesses, with average yearly spending of about 1.7% of GDP in 2025-26. Spending on internal security and defence will increase by 0.5% of GDP in 2025 and by an additional 0.9% of GDP in 2026. Legislated expenditures in social protection and public services, and interest expenses add to spending pressures. A tax on undistributed profits of credit institutions, the transfer of 1 percentage point of gross wages from the mandatory asset-backed private pension pillar to the solidarity-based public pension pillar, and rising excise taxes will partly finance the increased spending in 2025-26. There are also plans to transfer some public administrative functions to the private sector but it remains uncertain if these measures will effectively expand fiscal space. Economic activity will gradually recover, driven by domestic demand Real GDP growth will rebound to 1.1% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. Private consumption will recover gradually, accelerating in 2026 as confidence improves. Public consumption will further increase due to rising spending on defence and public services. Trade policy uncertainty will weigh on exports and business investment. Tight labour markets and planned increases in minimum wages will support wage growth and lead to sticky core inflation. However, a cap on public sector wage growth will moderate wage increases. Delays in the absorption of EU funds due to skilled labour shortages, rising costs and weak capacity in infrastructure planning could weigh on domestic demand. On the upside, a stronger-than\u0002expected impact of fiscal expansion in Germany on euro area growth would raise export demand. Strengthening competition and addressing skills shortages will support business dynamism, innovation and investment Reducing high credit costs calls for lowering switching costs for loans to businesses and strengthening competition enforcement. Listing large state-owned enterprises would help improve their governance and attract investors. Strengthening the powers of the Competition Council to conduct market investigations and enforce competitive neutrality of state-owned enterprises would foster business dynamism, innovation and investment. Reducing social security contributions for low-income earners, raising progressivity of personal income taxes and stepping up enforcement efforts would help reduce informality. This also requires raising trust in institutions and continuing the fight against corruption, for example by applying the heavy fines for tax evasion and bribery that current legislation allows, while ensuring that they are proportionate. Lowering occupation-specific restrictions and facilitating administrative procedures for migrants can help to reduce skilled labour shortages, while investing more in childcare facilities would increase the labour supply of women. Establishing a tri-partite training fund and improving cooperation in training design and implementation among firms and training providers is also key. 204  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Lithuania GDP is projected to grow by 2.7% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, after 2.8% in 2024. Strong real wage gains will continue supporting private consumption, especially in 2025. After a decline in 2024, investment is expected to increase progressively, supported by improved financial conditions and higher capacity utilisation but hampered by trade policy uncertainty. Despite a negative carry-over in 2025, exports are expected to increase moderately, but economic activity in the euro area is a key risk for Lithuania, along with global energy prices and geopolitical tensions. The fiscal stance is expected to loosen over 2025-26. Nevertheless, creating additional fiscal space will be key to financing rising ageing-related spending as well as defence spending. Moreover, deepening capital markets will be essential for alleviating the financial constraints that many firms are facing, and supporting investment and productivity growth. Further strengthening the public integrity framework would also support investor confidence. Economic activity has continued to strengthen GDP increased by 2.8% in 2024 as a whole and by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2025, largely supported by strong real wage growth and private consumption. Nevertheless, investment declined amid low capacity utilisation and subdued business confidence, especially in services. Consumer confidence remains high but has been declining since the end of 2024. Headline inflation bottomed out in October 2024 and reached 3.6% in April 2025, amid higher food and energy prices. While immigration helped to alleviate some labour shortages, the labour market is tight, with vacancies at a high level and contributing to strong wage growth. Unemployment, at 6.4% in March 2025, is below its long-term average. Lithuania 1. Harmonised index of consumer prices excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco. 2. Total economy.

Higher US tariffs on EU goods will thus indirectly weigh on Lithuania through reduced activity in the European Union, which accounts for 60% of total Lithuanian exports. Fiscal policy is becoming more accommodative Financing conditions, measured by long-term interest rates, have improved compared to a year ago and are expected to stabilise, as the spread vis-à-vis German benchmarks settles around 0.7 percentage points, down from 2.2 percentage points when inflation peaked. The fiscal deficit is expected to increase further from 1.3% in 2024 to 3.0% in 2025 and 2026. The main factors contributing to a higher headline deficit in 2025-26 than in 2024 are related to pension benefits and public wages. The State Defence Council, comprising Lithuania’s political and military leaders, recently agreed to raise defence spending to 5-6% of GDP annually over 2026-30, up from 3% in 2025. While Parliament still needs to approve this plan and clarify financing, and budget cuts are envisaged in non-defence ministries, the increase in defence spending may raise the 2026 fiscal deficit beyond the current projection. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Lithuania Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 56.7 2.5 0.3 2.8 2.7 2.4 Private consumption 31.9 2.0 -0.3 3.5 4.9 4.0 Government consumption 9.9 1.2 -0.2 1.4 1.0 0.8 Gross fixed capital formation 12.7 5.2 9.3 -1.3 4.9 4.6 Final domestic demand 54.5 2.6 1.9 2.0 4.2 3.5 Stockbuilding¹ - 0.4 -0.3 -3.3 1.0 1.6 0.0 Total domestic demand 54.2 2.9 -0.9 3.1 6.1 3.5 Exports of goods and services 45.1 12.4 -3.4 2.1 1.1 2.6 Imports of goods and services 42.6 12.7 -5.3 2.4 5.1 4.2 Net exports¹ 2.5 0.3 1.8 -0.2 -2.7 -1.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 16.1 9.0 3.4 4.7 3.2 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 18.9 8.7 0.9 4.0 2.5 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 10.5 9.6 3.2 2.9 2.4 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 6.0 6.8 7.1 6.3 5.8 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 0.9 3.0 7.9 7.4 6.8 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -0.7 -0.7 -1.3 -3.0 -3.0 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 37.7 38.5 40.3 43.3 44.0 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 38.1 37.3 38.2 41.4 42.1 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -6.0 1.1 3.0 3.3 2.1 Percentage changes, volume (2021 prices) 1.

Sustained real wage gains and a lower saving rate will continue supporting private consumption, especially in 2025. Investment is expected to rebound progressively. While lower long-term interest rates and higher capacity utilisation will support investment, trade policy uncertainty is likely to hamper it. Exports are projected to pick up but will remain closely connected to external demand from Lithuania’s main trading partners. Economic activity in the euro area is thus a key risk for Lithuania, along with global energy prices and geopolitical tensions. Structural reforms would improve fiscal sustainability and support investment Lithuania will face a major demographic shock that will increase pension-related costs, with high old-age poverty and low life expectancy for men making it difficult to contain these pressures. In this context, creating additional fiscal space will be needed to ensure fiscal sustainability. This will require improving the efficiency of public spending, increasing tax revenues and encouraging formal economic activity. Strengthening productivity growth will sustain living standards despite population ageing. While Lithuania’s product market regulations and insolvency framework are among the most conducive to productivity growth in the OECD, many firms are facing financial constraints. The development of capital markets would support productivity growth by facilitating investment in intangibles, research and development, and technological innovation. This requires increasing the supply and demand of non-bank capital, including by mobilising institutional investors such as pension funds, leveraging digital financing, and listing a wider range of state-owned enterprises. Further strengthening the public integrity framework, including by systematically monitoring the post-public employment activities of high-ranking public officials and reinforcing leadership support for integrity measures in public institutions, would also limit perceived corruption and support investor confidence.  207 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Luxembourg GDP is projected to grow by 2.1% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026, following a strong rebound in activity in the final quarter of 2024. Private consumption will remain robust as real wage growth, bolstered by receding inflation and rising wage rates, supports households’ real disposable income. Lower interest rates will provide stimulus to the financial and construction sectors. Risks are broadly balanced. Construction and finance may recover faster than expected. Weaker activity in the euro area and increasing barriers to trade could dampen the recovery. Fiscal policy should remain prudent through the full phasing-out of energy policy supports. A comprehensive pension reform, to raise contributions, increase the effective retirement age and adjust benefits, is needed to ensure sustainability for future generations. Rising capacity constraints imply the need to transition from a growth model based on rapid labour force growth to one based on innovation and skills, while maintaining public investment in transport and climate mitigation actions. Housing affordability should be tackled through reforms aimed at relaxing structural barriers to developing supply. Economic activity recovered strongly in the final quarter of 2024 Industrial production and construction activity rose slightly through 2024. Lower interest rates fuelled the recovery of the financial sector and of housing transactions in the last quarter of 2024. High-frequency indicators and the decline in new loans for house purchases suggest a slowdown in the first quarter of 2025. Business confidence indicators in most non-financial services have recovered since the sharp fall in 2024Q3 but remain below historical averages. While labour shortages persist, they have significantly eased from the post-pandemic peak. Wage indexation supported households’ purchasing power and private consumption through 2024, despite weak consumer sentiment. In the year to April 2025, despite the partial lifting of energy price supports and some increase in food and energy prices, headline inflation fell to 1.7% (down from 3.2% in April 2024) and core inflation to 2.1%.

However, indirect effects through weaker demand from European partners, including automotive components from Germany, are expected. Furthermore, lower equity prices and weaker household income growth in Europe may slow activity in the financial sector. Fiscal policy will remain prudent The government budget recorded a small surplus in 2024, mostly thanks to higher revenues from direct business taxes and lower current outlays. Despite the scaling back of energy policy support, the budget balance is projected to return to a small deficit in 2025 and 2026 due to increasing defence expenditures, which should reach 2% of GDP by 2030, up from 1.3% in 2024. Overall, the fiscal stance is projected to ease by 1.7% of GDP over 2025 and 2026. The recovery in activity is expected to continue Growth is projected to strengthen gradually over 2025 and 2026, as easing financial conditions bolster the financial and construction sectors. Despite increased global uncertainty, domestic consumption will be resilient, due to the scheduled wage indexation in 2025Q2 supporting real incomes, and to a modest draw\u0002down of household savings towards their long-term average rate.

Amid global uncertainty and growing barriers to trade, the contribution of exports to GDP will remain modest. Risks are broadly balanced, with a faster than-expected recovery in finance and construction representing the main upside risk. The main downside risks include a slowdown of economic activity in the euro area, potential financial markets disruptions, and a contraction of exports linked to tariffs. Structural reforms are necessary to boost productivity growth and ensure fiscal and environmental sustainability To safeguard fiscal sustainability, a comprehensive pension reform is needed to raise contributions, increase the effective retirement age and contain expenditures. Productivity is high relative to the EU area average but growth is stagnant. Structural reforms are necessary to support private investment in innovation and improve the quality of life-long training, including through better coordination across the main public actors supporting R&D, and a shift from the current institution-oriented system to a project\u0002oriented one. Quality standards for training providers can be strengthened by introducing a national accreditation agency and by tightening quality controls. Despite substantial progress, further efforts to implement the national energy and climate plan and strengthen public transport are needed to meet climate targets, mitigate congestion and improve attractiveness to cross-border workers. 210  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Malaysia GDP is projected to grow by 3.8% in 2025 and 4.1% in 2026. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. Private consumption will remain robust, supported by favourable labour market conditions. Investment growth will benefit from new opportunities in technology-intensive sectors, although global trade tensions are generating significant risks. Inflation is expected to rise amid a planned removal of fuel subsidies and potential wage pressures. Government debt has increased to 64.6% of GDP in 2024. Fiscal consolidation is needed to rebuild fiscal space, including by mobilising more revenues and phasing out energy subsidies. The neutral monetary policy stance should be maintained in the short term. Substantial gender gaps are hampering women’s economic opportunities, which could be addressed by investing more in childcare support and promoting workplace flexibility. Reducing skill mismatches could boost both growth and social inclusion. The economy has been growing steadily Real GDP grew by 5.1% in 2024, largely driven by private consumption and to a lesser extent investment. After a small contraction in late 2024, GDP growth rebounded in the first quarter of 2025, with 0.7% growth quarter-on-quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis. Inflation has been contained, with neither annual headline nor core inflation exceeding 2% since August 2024, despite an uptick in core inflation in early 2025. Meanwhile, the labour market has been strong as unemployment fell to 3.0% in March 2025, its lowest level since April 2015, while labour force participation rose to an all-time high of 70.7% in the same month. Exports grew strongly in 2024 and shipments to the United States, Malaysia's third largest export destination, accounted for about the half of the growth of merchandise exports. Exports to China, the country's second largest export market, declined by 2.2%. Due to strong import growth, however, net exports made only a marginal contribution to growth. These trends continued in the first three months of 2025. Tourist arrivals have now recovered to well above their 2019 levels. Exports to the United States accounted for 13.2% of merchandise exports and 10.3% of GDP in 2024, and a 10% tariff is now being applied to merchandise imports from Malaysia, although there some exemptions for particular products.  211 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Malaysia Source: CEIC.

The lower deficit will help bring down government debt, which has increased rapidly from 52.4% of GDP in 2019 to 64.6% in 2024 and create fiscal space to address rising long-term spending pressures related to social protection and climate change. The central bank has maintained the policy rate at 3% since July 2023, which is a broadly neutral monetary policy stance. This stance is expected to continue, although the central bank should remain vigilant in the face of emerging inflationary pressures from the continued withdrawal of fuel subsidies, increases in the minimum wage and civil servants’ salaries, and tight labour market. The economy will grow moderately, but faces significant downside risks Output is projected to grow by 3.8% in 2025 and 4.1% in 2026. Private consumption will be buoyed by favourable labour market conditions, although the withdrawal of fuel subsidies will weigh on the real purchasing power of some households. Private investment will be supported by new opportunities in technology-intensive sectors. Infrastructure projects and investments by public corporations will support public investment. Inflation is projected to rise slightly to 2.2% in 2025 and 2.7% in 2026, reflecting progress in fuel subsidy withdrawal. Export growth will be affected by global trade tensions and high levels of uncertainty, which could have more negative effects than currently assumed, particularly if tariff rates rise further. On the domestic front, stronger than expected inflationary pressures remain a downside risk. Structural reforms can reduce inequalities and make growth more sustainable Improving the targeting of social protection while raising social assistance coverage and benefit levels would allow stronger reductions of poverty and inequality. Policies to bridge the gender gap, including improving access to affordable childcare and extending paid maternity and paternity leave periods, would allow more women to participate in the labour market and find jobs that match their skills. Measures to reduce skill mismatches, such as expanding the skills registry and investing more into adult education, could boost both growth and social inclusion. Addressing climate change requires accelerating the planned withdrawal of energy subsidies and a stronger role for carbon pricing, complemented by stricter regulations and additional investments. A “National Policy on Climate Change 2.0” was announced in September 2024 and contains ambitious measures in this direction, which should be implemented without unnecessary delays. Private investment could benefit from a more even playing field between private and government\u0002linked enterprises.  213 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Mexico The economy is projected to grow by 0.4% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026. Low unemployment and easing inflation will support consumption. Public consumption and investment will remain subdued, given ongoing fiscal consolidation. Exports will be dampened by tariffs, uncertainty and weaker global growth. Investment will be supported by declining interest rates but is expected to recover only gradually, reflecting high uncertainty. Implementing a medium-term fiscal plan could help reduce the deficit gradually, creating room for investments that boost productivity, such as education. To ensure that inflation continues to decrease towards target, the central bank should continue its prudent and gradual easing cycle. Expanding dual vocational programmes would enhance technical skills availability, boosting competitiveness and facilitating access to formal jobs. Agriculture has recovered but investment is slowing Short-term indicators point to a partial improvement in economic activity during the first quarter of 2025, with GDP growing by 0.2% (quarter on quarter), after the 0.6% contraction in the previous quarter. The improvement was driven entirely by a rebound in the agriculture sector, following weather related disruptions at the end of 2024, while industrial production contracted and services stagnated. Non\u0002residential construction is losing momentum after the completion of major infrastructure projects in the South, while investment in machinery and equipment is also easing amid high uncertainty. Private consumption has slowed, in line with slowing formal job creation. Exports remain subdued, constrained by persistent trade-related uncertainty. Unemployment, at 2.6% in March, remains at historically low levels, although participation has recently declined. Inflationary pressures are easing, although headline and core inflation rose to 3.9% (year-on-year) in April, driven by volatility in some food prices and seasonal variations in tourism-related services.

As a result, Mexico is particularly impacted by rising trade restrictions and ongoing uncertainty. The projections assume that Mexico’s exports to the United States that are compliant with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) face a 0% tariff, while non-compliant exports face a 25% tariff, both in 2025 and 2026. Around 50% of Mexico’s exports to the United States are currently compliant. Compliance is assumed to gradually rise towards 75% in 2026 by following the necessary steps, such as completing certifications of origin. Automobiles and automobile parts are assumed to be subject to a 25% tariff rate in 2025 and 2026, with the share of United States content excluded from this tariff. The projections also assume a 25% tariff on United States imports of steel and aluminium products from Mexico. Monetary policy easing and fiscal consolidation should be gradual The central bank has continued its monetary easing cycle, lowering the policy rate to 8.5% in May. Easing inflationary pressures, weakening economic activity and well-anchored inflation expectations support a further gradual, data-dependant reduction in the policy rate to 7% by the end of 2025, with additional cuts in 2026. After widening to 4.9% of GDP in 2024, the highest level in 35 years, the budget deficit is expected to fall to 3.5% in 2025, primarily through cuts in public investment, and to 3% in 2026. By the end of 2026, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be around 52% of GDP. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Mexico Current prices MXN billion GDP at market prices 26 690.0 3.7 3.3 1.5 0.4 1.1 Private consumption 18 236.2 4.8 4.2 2.8 0.5 1.8 Government consumption 3 043.9 2.0 1.8 1.6 0.2 0.3 Gross fixed capital formation 5 687.6 7.5 16.6 3.3 -0.9 1.5 Final domestic demand 26 967.7 5.1 6.6 2.8 0.1 1.6 Stockbuilding¹ 237.7 0.0 -0.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 27 205.4 5.0 6.2 2.8 0.2 1.6 Exports of goods and services 10 827.9 9.5 -7.2 3.3 6.8 1.1 Imports of goods and services 11 343.3 8.6 3.7 2.7 3.1 2.4 Net exports¹ - 515.4 0.2 -4.7 0.1 1.2 -0.7 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.6 4.5 4.9 4.4 3.3 Consumer price index _ 7.9 5.5 4.7 3.4 3.2 Core inflation index² _ 7.6 6.7 4.1 3.6 3.2 Unemployment rate³ (% of labour force) _ 3.3 2.8 2.7 2.8 2.8 Government financial balance⁴ (% of GDP) _ -3.2 -3.4 -4.9 -3.5 -3.0 Government gross debt⁴ (% of GDP) _ 48.2 47.4 50.6 51.8 52.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -1.5 -0.3 -0.1 -0.2 -0.4 Percentage changes, volume (2018 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Private consumption will be supported by low unemployment and declining inflation. Private investment will gradually benefit from lower interest rates, though it will remain constrained by high domestic and global uncertainty. Public investment is set to stay subdued as part of efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit. Quarterly export growth will be dampened by trade tariffs and high global uncertainty. Both headline and core inflation will continue to fall gradually. However, the outlook for both growth and inflation remain uncertain. Given Mexico’s high exposure to the US market, the projected US slowdown in 2025-26 and tighter financial conditions may weigh further on external and investment demand. Moreover, increased global risk aversion and exchange rate volatility could raise sovereign borrowing costs and further limit fiscal space. On the upside, a reduction in uncertainty, such as through a swift and successful renegotiation of the trade agreement with the United States and Canada, could support investment and exports more strongly than currently anticipated. Boosting productivity and adapting to climate change are priorities Enhancing immovable property tax collection and improving tax administration, including through digitalisation, could help increase tax revenues and create fiscal space for additional spending in productivity-enhancing areas, such as education or digitalisation. Systematically applying cost-benefit analysis would enhance the efficiency of public spending. A comprehensive early childhood education and care system would facilitate women’s labour market participation. Encouraging private investment in renewable energy through supportive regulations could help turn Mexico's abundant renewable resources into a competitive advantage. Improving water management would strengthen Mexico’s adaptation to climate change, reduce operational risks and help to attract investment. 216  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Netherlands GDP is set to grow by 1.3% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026, driven by strengthening private consumption on the back of rising disposable household income, and government investment. Private investment will also improve, supported by gradually declining interest rates, but will be dampened by global uncertainty. However, external demand will weaken due to higher tariffs and trade uncertainty. Annual headline inflation is set to fall only slowly to 2.9% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026, as service price pressures persist. Unemployment will increase marginally from 3.7% in 2024 to 4% in 2026, as the bankruptcy rate rises to pre-pandemic levels. The fiscal stance will be expansionary over 2025-26 due to higher spending on health care, housing and defence, as well as cuts in personal, corporate and environmental taxes. In the short term, fiscal measures are projected to support economic growth but worsen the fiscal balance, with the government deficit projected to widen from 0.9% of GDP in 2024 to 2.8% in 2026. The government should prioritise investments supporting the green transition and productivity, including enhancing digital skills and increasing the adoption of digital technologies. The economy remains resilient In the first quarter of 2025, GDP growth slowed to 0.1% quarter-on-quarter, down from 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Weaker household spending and fixed asset investment weighed on the economy, partly offset by higher public consumption and a smaller reduction in inventories. Headline inflation picked up to 4.1% in April, from 3.4% in the previous quarter, reflecting higher food and service prices. Annual wage growth under collective labour agreements moderated, falling to 5.5% from 6.6% the quarter before. The labour market remained tight, with job vacancies continuing to outnumber unemployed persons, and the unemployment rate stable at 3.8% in April. Consumer confidence continued to decline between January and April. Business sentiment also remained below its long-term average, declining again in April after a modest rebound earlier in 2025.

About 5.7% of goods exports are destined for the United States. However, the most important exports include semiconductor machines and pharmaceuticals, which have so far been exempt from the increase in US import tariffs on EU goods. Indirectly, both through its strong integration in global value chains and as a logistic hub for EU trade, the Dutch economy will be affected via the slowdown in global trade. Fiscal policy is expansionary The fiscal stance will be expansionary over 2025-26, with fiscal easing projected to be around 1.4% of potential GDP, supporting short-term economic growth but worsening the government’s fiscal balance. The budget deficit is projected to widen from 0.9% of GDP in 2024 to 2.8% in 2026, in line with government plans for higher spending on health care, housing and defence. These spending increases are partially offset by spending cuts in education, public services and development aid. In 2026, the transfer of military pensions to the Dutch civil service pension fund (ABP) will weigh additionally on the fiscal balance. The government support of low- and middle-income household purchasing power through the introduction of a new reduced tax bracket in income taxation took effect at the beginning of 2025 and will reduce revenues over the projection period. Overall, the debt ratio is expected to rise from the historically low level of 43.3% of GDP in 2024 to 46.8% in 2026. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Netherlands Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 891.3 5.0 0.1 1.0 1.3 1.1 Private consumption 380.4 6.9 0.8 1.0 1.5 1.6 Government consumption 226.1 1.3 2.9 3.6 2.4 1.7 Gross fixed capital formation 184.6 3.4 1.2 -0.5 0.4 1.3 Final domestic demand 791.1 4.5 1.5 1.4 1.5 1.6 Stockbuilding¹ 13.6 0.5 -2.3 -0.4 0.3 0.0 Total domestic demand 804.7 5.0 -0.9 1.0 1.9 1.6 Exports of goods and services 769.3 4.5 -0.4 0.1 0.3 1.1 Imports of goods and services 682.7 4.4 -1.7 0.0 0.7 1.6 Net exports¹ 86.6 0.5 1.1 0.1 -0.3 -0.3 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.2 7.3 5.2 3.3 2.6 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 11.6 4.1 3.2 2.9 2.5 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 4.8 6.4 3.2 2.6 2.6 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 3.5 3.5 3.7 3.9 4.0 Household saving ratio, net3 (% of disposable income) _ 7.1 7.5 9.4 9.7 8.8 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ 0.0 -0.4 -0.9 -2.3 -2.8 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 52.7 49.8 47.5 48.3 50.0 General government debt, Maastricht definition⁴ (% of GDP) _ 48.4 45.2 43.3 44.7 46.8 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ 6.6 9.9 9.9 9.3 9.1 Percentage changes, volume (2021 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Private consumption will be a key driver, buttressed by a boost in real income as wages continue growing above inflation, though weak consumer confidence may temper the pace of recovery. Investment will recover, supported by gradually declining interest rates and public spending, though uncertainty, tight financial conditions and supply constraints could weigh on the momentum. External demand is expected to remain subdued, reflecting ongoing trade fragmentation, tariff uncertainty and weakening global growth. Annual headline inflation is set to fall only slowly to 2.9% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026, and core inflation is expected to remain sticky slowing to 2.6% in 2026, with rising labour costs continuing to exert upward pressure on services prices. Bankruptcy rates will rise, but lead only to a marginal increase in unemployment from 3.7% in 2024 to 4% in 2026, as the labour market remains tight. The economic outlook is surrounded by significant downside risks, primarily related to rising geopolitical tensions and trade fragmentation. Domestically, labour market tightness remains a key concern. Continued wage growth could maintain price pressures, especially if euro area policy rates are lowered while inflation remains elevated in the Netherlands. While this could erode price competitiveness, weaken purchasing power, and slow private consumption, it could also help to alleviate labour market tightness. Furthermore, trade diversion could lead to lower import prices thereby creating downward pressure on inflation. Enhancing tax efficiency would support growth The Netherlands’ strong fiscal position provides room for a moderately expansionary stance, though rising population ageing and significant investment needs for the green transition will test medium-term fiscal sustainability. To increase the share of renewables in the energy mix, the government needs to support investment in the electricity grid. Long-standing structural challenges also need to be addressed, focussing on easing labour market pressures and supporting productivity growth. Simplifying the tax and benefits system and removing distortions favouring owner-occupied housing could increase productivity-enhancing investment and ease tensions in the labour market. Enhancing digital skills and increasing the adoption of digital technologies particularly among smaller enterprises could further boost productivity growth and maintain competitiveness.  219 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 New Zealand Following the deepest recession since 1991, economic activity began to recover in late 2024. The expansion is expected to continue with growth projected to rise to 0.8% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 supported by lower interest rates. However, increased trade restrictions and high uncertainty about trade policy globally will temper external demand, confidence and the pace of the recovery. Inflation is set to fall further due to lower oil prices and higher spare capacity including in the labour market. The unemployment rate is expected to peak in late 2025 at around 5.4%. With core inflation declining, and inflation expectations well anchored, the central bank should steadily reduce the official cash rate to the neutral rate of around 3% and reduce it further if the recovery falters. The pace of fiscal consolidation is appropriate but may need to be slowed if the expansion stalls. Trend growth will remain modest without energy, innovation, investment and skills reforms to lift lacklustre productivity. A recovery is underway Rebalancing of the economy following a severe episode of post-pandemic overheating is well advanced. Headline inflation has declined towards the midpoint of the central bank’s 1 to 3% target range and core inflation is also declining, albeit more gradually. The economy started to recover in late 2024. The rebound was narrowly based on exports, public consumption and stock building. Private consumption and investment growth remained subdued and consumer confidence fell sharply in early 2025. Indicators for the construction sector are showing signs of bottoming out. Net inwards migration has fallen from a peak of 135 000 per annum (2.6% of the population), to a more sustainable level of around 30 000. Commodity export volumes and prices grew strongly in late 2024 and early 2025, Tourism growth has been buoyant, with arrivals rising to 85% of their pre-pandemic level in 2024, but showed signs of weakening in early2025.

The direct effects of higher trade restrictions are likely to be mainly via weaker export prices rather than lower volumes as in the short run agricultural export volumes are supply driven and New Zealand is a price taker in the United States market. In addition, New Zealand’s export prices are expected to come under pressure from greater competition in markets outside the United States. Weaker external demand is also projected to eventually slow export volume growth, weighing on the expansion. The projections assume no trade policy retaliation by New Zealand. As a result, effects on inflation are assumed to be only indirect, via higher costs in global production chains, as well as cheaper imports other countries that are attempting to sell exports no longer bound for the United States elsewhere. Monetary policy is expected to loosen further while budget consolidation continues With inflation falling and inside the target range the central bank cut the official cash rate by 200 basis points to 3.5% between August 2024 and April 2025. It is assumed to cut the official rate to a neutral level of around 3% during 2025 and should reduce it further if the expansion falters. Public debt has risen significantly, and the budget is coming under pressure from rising pension expenditure and faces growing defence spending needs. The 2025 Budget continues the programme of reducing expenditure as a share of GDP. It also took an important step to address the economy’s low capital intensity by introducing the “Investment Boost”, which allows firms to immediately deduct 20% of the value of a new asset from their taxable income on top of normal depreciation. Provided the expansion continues, the government should continue to fully pursue its programme to reduce expenditure as a share of GDP. This is expected to increase the structural fiscal balance by 1.2% of GDP and 0.2% of GDP in 2025 and 2026 respectively. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 New Zealand Current prices NZD billion GDP at market prices 359.1 3.2 1.9 -0.1 0.8 1.7 Private consumption 202.9 4.2 1.0 0.2 0.3 1.8 Government consumption 73.4 5.2 0.8 0.0 0.3 0.3 Gross fixed capital formation 85.7 4.2 -0.1 -4.6 -1.0 2.7 Final domestic demand 362.0 4.4 0.7 -1.0 0.0 1.7 Stockbuilding¹ 8.7 0.2 -1.7 0.2 0.2 0.0 Total domestic demand 370.7 4.4 -0.9 -0.8 0.2 1.7 Exports of goods and services 77.7 -0.8 11.4 4.2 4.0 1.5 Imports of goods and services 89.4 4.6 -0.6 2.4 1.3 1.4 Net exports¹ - 11.7 -1.3 2.8 0.3 0.6 0.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.2 3.6 3.6 2.6 1.9 Consumer price index _ 7.2 5.7 2.9 2.4 2.1 Core inflation index2 _ 6.0 5.6 3.5 2.5 2.2 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 3.3 3.7 4.7 5.3 5.2 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ -3.0 -8.5 -7.8 -6.8 -6.6 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -2.6 -2.1 -1.8 -1.2 -1.2 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 51.2 54.4 57.0 57.8 58.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -8.8 -6.9 -6.1 -5.0 -4.8 Percentage changes, volume (2009/2010 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

However, escalating trade restrictions, weakening external demand and high trade policy uncertainty are hitting confidence and are set to hold back the recovery. High and rising prices for electricity hedges are contributing to industrial closures and are expected to restrain investment. The unemployment rate is set to peak at around 5.4% in late 2025 before gradually declining as employment growth picks up. Headline inflation is projected to fall to 2.5% in 2025 due to the decline in oil prices. Core inflation is projected to continue falling slowly. A large increase in tariffs on New Zealand exports, or low rainfall that reduces hydroelectricity generation and raises electricity prices would slow growth. However, a faster recovery of investment may occur as the “Investment Boost”, and other reforms to accelerate FDI and infrastructure construction, take hold. Increasing trade and investment linkages is key for sustaining the expansion An increasingly febrile and fractured geoeconomic environment means New Zealand will need to work harder working with like-minded countries to expand trade and encourage foreign direct investment. This is crucial for boosting investment and management skills required to address the chronically low capital\u0002to-labour ratio and poor productivity growth. As well as maintaining low trade policy barriers and further expanding free trade agreements, the government should continue efforts to attract more foreign investment via more streamlined government support and lowering high restrictions. Competition and energy related reforms are required to improve the reliability and affordability of electricity. This is a prerequisite for more investment in digitalisation and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. 222  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Norway Mainland GDP is projected to increase by 1.7% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. Solid household disposable income growth will boost private consumption. Housing investment will rebound from a slump as interest rates decline. Non-oil business investment will strengthen only slightly due to heightened uncertainty. Oil production is expected to decline markedly. Strong domestic cost pressures, currently pushing up inflation, are expected to subside gradually. The central bank is expected to start cutting the policy rate around mid-2025, as inflation eases. Fiscal policy is set to remain expansionary in 2025-26, worsening the structural non-oil budget balance further. Easing product market regulations and insolvency regimes would spur private investment and productivity, fostering stronger self-driven economic growth. Mainland activity has shown signs of recovery Mainland GDP growth picked up in the first quarter of 2025. Household consumption, which had remained somewhat subdued due to high inflation and high interest rates, grew strongly on the back of solid real wage gains. Housing investment declined considerably through late 2024, and remains depressed. Growth in non-oil business investment has generally remained weak. There are signs of a more broad-based recovery, as both manufacturing production and retail sales have risen in recent months. Business surveys also suggest some momentum in activity, except for construction, in the near term. Headline inflation has been volatile in recent months, largely owing to food and energy prices, and stood at 2.5% in April.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/ejk3yo  223 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Norway: Demand, output and prices StatLink 2https://stat.link/c6q4wn The United States imposed a 10% tariff on goods imported from Norway in April, which could be raised to 15% by July. The United States accounts for around 3% of Norway's total exports, so the direct impact of the increased US tariff will be relatively modest. In this projection, Norway is assumed not to introduce a retaliatory tariff and the possible rise in July is assumed not to take place. Nonetheless, Norway will be affected by increased uncertainty in the global economy and a contraction in demand, including for oil and gas. Both oil and gas prices have declined markedly since early April, reducing export and government revenue. Macroeconomic policies will be supportive The central bank has repeatedly postponed the envisaged first rate cut, amid stronger-than-expected inflationary pressures associated with strong wage growth. With inflation expectations well anchored around the 2% target, however, the monetary policy stance is set to become less restrictive starting around mid-2025, with the policy rate expected to be brought down to 3.5% by late 2026. Overall, fiscal policy is expected to be expansionary in 2025 and 2026. Defence spending is to rise to 2.2% of GDP in 2025, and personal income tax and social security contributions are being cut. The Revised National Budget introduces a new electricity support package. It also considerably increases support to Ukraine, albeit with little effect on economic activity in Norway. The structural non-oil budget deficit is expected to widen by more than 2½ percentage points of mainland GDP this year, with the increased support to Ukraine largely accounting for the deviation from the initial budget. The structural non-oil deficit in 2025 is still expected to remain below the 3% of the value of the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) threshold, which has been raised significantly due to substantial increases in GPFG assets over time. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Norway Current prices NOK billion Mainland GDP at market prices1 3 315.3 4.3 0.7 0.6 1.7 1.9 GDP at market prices 4 323.9 3.2 0.1 2.1 0.3 1.6 Private consumption 1 626.3 7.8 -1.2 1.2 2.7 2.2 Government consumption 970.7 1.8 3.4 2.4 1.5 1.1 Gross fixed capital formation 992.2 0.3 -1.5 -1.9 -0.4 2.2 Final domestic demand 3 589.2 4.1 -0.2 0.7 1.6 1.9 Stockbuilding² 92.6 1.4 -0.5 -0.7 0.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 3 681.8 5.6 -0.8 -0.1 1.6 1.8 Exports of goods and services 1 860.9 5.2 0.4 5.7 -1.4 1.6 Imports of goods and services 1 218.8 13.3 -1.5 3.7 1.0 2.5 Net exports² 642.1 -1.5 0.7 1.5 -1.0 -0.1 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 28.4 -11.1 -0.2 1.7 0.4 Consumer price index _ 5.7 5.5 3.2 3.0 2.3 Core inflation index³ _ 3.6 5.8 3.5 2.9 2.5 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 3.3 3.6 4.0 4.1 4.0 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 4.7 4.0 7.3 7.8 7.9 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ 25.5 16.5 13.2 10.0 10.3 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 42.2 51.0 62.0 60.7 59.5 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ 29.0 16.6 16.9 14.6 12.5 Percentage changes, volume (2022 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Solid growth in real household disposable income, driven by strong wage growth, lower inflation and government support, will drive up private consumption. As interest rates decline, housing investment will pick up in the latter half of 2025 from currently depressed levels. Non-oil business investment will increase only moderately, reflecting heightened uncertainty in the global economy. Oil production, exports and investment are projected to weaken this year. Oil and gas prices could affect the Norwegian economy substantially in both directions. A surge in oil and gas prices would considerably boost export and government revenue. Conversely, an abrupt decline in oil and gas prices would substantially strain the budget balance, especially given the significant deterioration of the structural non-oil budget balance in recent years. Similarly, a sharp drop in the value of GPFG assets would abruptly reduce fiscal space. Public policy needs to stimulate market forces While the Norwegian economy has been bolstered by offshore activity and government spending for some time, spurring private investment and productivity is key to making growth more sustainable. Industrial subsidies have increased substantially in recent years, with too much focus on specific industries such as battery factories and offshore wind projects. The government should stop support to these, and focus instead on further reforming market regulations, notably by reducing administrative burdens and licence requirements for firm entry and alleviating penalties for business failure. This would help ensure fiscal sustainability while boosting private investment, particularly innovative ventures, via market forces.  225 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Peru GDP growth is projected to slow to 2.8% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026, with global and domestic policy uncertainty weighing on the outlook. Government spending will moderate as fiscal consolidation resumes. Private investment will remain moderate, constrained by persistent uncertainty and tighter global financial conditions. Private consumption will be supported by low inflation. Export growth will weaken reflecting the direct impact of new US tariffs on Peruvian products and the broader drag from weaker global growth. Inflation is expected to remain close to the central bank’s 2% target. The Central Bank’s broadly neutral monetary stance is appropriate and should remain cautious and data dependent. The government plans gradual consolidation in 2025 and 2026 to align the deficit with fiscal rules, but rising expenditure pressures and optimistic revenue projections make compliance challenging, requiring additional measures to meet fiscal targets. Streamlining permits, easing regulatory burdens, and strengthening subnational investment capacity can help crowd in private investment. Strong domestic demand propelled the economic recovery GDP rose by 3.3% in 2024, led by strong domestic demand and a rebound in agricultural and mining exports. Public investment rose by 14% and private consumption was supported by pension fund withdrawals. Private investment began to recover moderately, aided by improved business sentiment, looser financial conditions, and newly awarded Public-Private Partnership contracts. Historically high terms of trade supported the current account. Monthly GDP indicators show that growth remained strong in the first quarter of 2025, with GDP expanding by 3.9% year-on-year. Inflation remains well anchored within the central bank’s 1–3% target band, with headline and core inflation rising by 1.6% and 1.9% in April relative to the previous year, respectively, and expectations close to 2%. Despite a 0.8% rise in employment in 2024, real wages in the formal sector remain below 2019 levels, while high informality and weak participation persist, particularly for women and youth. Peru 1.

Pakistani hackers attacked 1.5 million-plus Indian websites after Operation Sindoor: Failure rate, names of 7 Pakistani hacker groups; techniques used and more [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Oct 13, 2025, 14:23 IST Share AA + **Text Size** - Small - Medium - Large Following the Pahalgam terror strike, Maharashtra Cyber identified seven APT groups, primarily Pakistan-allied, responsible for over 1.5 million cyber attacks targeting critical Indian infrastructure. While only 150 attacks succeeded, these groups employed malware, DDoS attacks, and misinformation campaigns. The attacks originated from Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Middle East, and Indonesia, with some successful defacements and alleged data theft. Representational AI image Maharashtra Cyber has reportedly identified seven Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups responsible for launching over 15 lakh cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure websites across India following the Pahalgam terror strike. Of these, only 150 attacks were successful, officials said, as per a report by news agency PTI. This means a failure rate of 99.99% or should one say abysmal success rate of 0.01%.In a report titled \"Road of Sindoor\", prepared under the military operation launched by the Indian armed forces under the same name against terrorists, the state's nodal cyber agency has detailed the cyber warfare launched by Pakistan-allied hacking groups. The report has been submitted to all key law enforcement agencies, including the Director General of Police and the State Intelligence Department.According to the report, these cyber attacks originated from Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Middle East, and an Indonesian group, said Yashasvi Yadav, Additional Director General of Police, Maharashtra Cyber. ## India-Pakistan Ceasefire has not stopped Pakistani hackers Even after India and Pakistan reached an understanding to stop military hostilities, Indian government websites are facing a barrage of cyber attacks from the neighbouring country as well as from Bangladesh and the Middle Eastern region, they said.\"The probe discovered that cyber attacks on (government websites in) India decreased after India-Pakistan ceased hostilities, but not fully stopped. These attacks continue from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Morocco, and Middle Eastern countries,\" he said.Pakistani hackers bringing down websites of major airports in India, Election Commission and ...Addressing reporters, a senior official of Maharashtra Cyber debunked claims of hackers stealing data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai, hacking aviation and municipal systems, and targeting the Election Commission website. ## Techniques used by Pakistani hackers The methods used by hackers included malware campaigns, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and GPS spoofing. The defacement of Indian websites was also reported. He said many such attacks were thwarted, and critical infrastructure of India was saved.The report also highlights a hybrid warfare strategy by Pakistan-allied groups that includes widespread misinformation campaigns. These groups falsely claimed to have hacked India's banking system and caused power outages. These false narratives included claims of cyber attacks on India's power grid, statewide blackouts, satellite jamming, disruption of the Northern Command, and an alleged attack on a BrahMos missile storage facility, Yadav said.Maharashtra Cyber identified and removed over 5,000 instances of misinformation and fake news related to India-Pakistan military conflicts that were circulating on social media. ## 7 Pakistani Hacker groups that attacked Indian websites The seven hacking groups identified in the report are APT 36 (Pakistan-based), Pakistan Cyber Force, Team Insane PK, Mysterious Bangladesh, Indo Hacks Sec, Cyber Group HOAX 1337, and National Cyber Crew (Pakistan-allied). These groups collectively launched approximately 1.5 million targeted cyber attacks on Indian infrastructure, Yadav said. ## The Indian websites Pakistani hackers brought down Among the 150 successful attacks, the Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council website was defaced. The attackers also claimed to have stolen data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), as well as from telecom companies, with some of the data allegedly appearing on the darknet. Additionally, the website of the Defence Nursing College in Jalandhar was defaced. **About the Author** [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) The TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote7) Close footnote The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote8)The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote9)Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote10)The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote11)The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. Close footnote ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote12)The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote13)By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote14)Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote15) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote16)Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote17)In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote18) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote19)In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote20)In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote21)Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. Close footnote Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows. [22](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote22)Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote23)Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote24) Close footnote A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote25)Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote26)A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote27)ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively. This is despite widespread condemnation from independent human rights bodies and refrains from the judiciary.[28](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote28)Following bulldozer action in the aftermath of the 2023 Nuh riots, the Punjab and Haryana High Court questioned whether the targeted demolitions of Muslim houses amounted to “an exercise of ethnic cleansing … by the State.”[29](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote29) Close footnote ## **Toward a Hindu** _**rashtra**_ **?** Religious polarization is likely to get worse in the run-up to the elections, with the BJP well-positioned to benefit electorally from the consolidation of a Hindu voting bloc.[30](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote30)At a campaign event during the ongoing elections, Modi himself stirred up communal tensions by referring to Muslims as “infiltrators” and raising alarms that the opposition planned to redistribute the country’s wealth to Muslims, a claim that was widely dismissed as misleading.[31](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote31)A recent report by the Washington, DC-based India Hate Lab found that hate speech, mainly directed against Muslims, peaked during campaigning for Indian state elections in 2023; the BJP won three of the five states that went to polls.[32](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote32)Anti-Muslim sentiment in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots, where Hindu mobs reportedly killed hundreds of Muslims, also helped Modi, then the chief minister of Gujarat, remain in power for over a decade before propelling his rise to the national level.[33](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote33)Besides the ‘Hindi heartland’ states of North and Central-West India, which have historically seen high levels of communal violence, religious polarization can also be expected to drive an increase in violence in states such as Kerala and West Bengal, as the BJP seeks to capitalize on Hindu pride to expand its political footprint.[34](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote34)The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote35)The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. Close footnote A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote36)Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote37)For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote38) Close footnote _**Visuals in this report were produced by Ana Marco.**_ ## Footnotes 01.

This marks a significant departure from the group’s usual playbook, which has been centred on Windows-centric malware and spear-phishing lures. By expanding its reach to compromise BOSS Linux, a system widely adopted by Indian government entities, APT36 is signalling not merely a technical upgrade but a deliberate escalation on the cyber-espionage front in the India-Pakistan rivalry. APT36’s targeting of BOSS Linux indicates a calculated attempt to undermine confidence in this indigenous platform. A successful breach not only grants access to sensitive communications and classified data but also erodes institutional faith in self-reliant technological ecosystems. This outcome serves Pakistan’s interests on multiple levels: tactically, by harvesting intelligence; and strategically, by discrediting India’s efforts at digital autonomy. > By expanding its reach to compromise BOSS Linux, a system widely adopted by Indian government entities, APT36 is signalling not merely a technical upgrade but a deliberate escalation on the cyber-espionage front in the India-Pakistan rivalry. The discovery of this campaign underscores an uncomfortable reality: Pakistan-based cyber actors, often operating under the aegis of state agencies or enjoying tacit state protection, are evolving their capabilities beyond low-level phishing attacks into strategically targeted, cross-platform espionage operations. This trend holds profound implications for India’s national security, not least because it compromises trust in indigenous technologies developed as alternatives to foreign software ecosystems. ## Anatomy of the New Campaign The latest intrusion by APT36 begins with a familiar vector, spear-phishing emails. Camouflaged as official government correspondence, these emails deliver compressed archives containing malicious desktop files. Unlike traditional Windows executables, these shortcuts are designed explicitly for Linux environments and crafted to resemble innocuous PDF files. When executed, the desktop file triggers a [series of covert commands](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments) embedded in its Exec field. Utilities such as ‘curl’ and ‘xxd’ are then employed to fetch a hex-encoded payload from [attacker-controlled infrastructure](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments), decode it, and silently deploy it under the temporary directory. With execution rights granted, [the payload operates silently](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments) in the background, all while the user is distracted by a decoy PDF opened in parallel. > Forensic evidence suggests a Pakistan state-backed effort, given the substantial resources expended on developing BOSS Linux-specific attack chains and maintaining redundant infrastructure. The campaign is more than an opportunistic strike; it is an assault on India’s technological sovereignty. Persistence is achieved by ensuring that the [malware relaunches upon every login.](https://cloudsek.com/blog/investigation-report-apt36-malware-campaign-using-desktop-entry-files-and-google-drive-payload-delivery) Its communications are funnelled to command-and-control (C2) nodes and the newly registered domain, both of which reflect a carefully coordinated campaign. Forensic evidence suggests a Pakistan state-backed effort, given the substantial resources expended on developing [BOSS Linux-specific attack chains and maintaining redundant infrastructure](https://teamwin.in/apt36-hackers-attacking-indian-boss-linux-systems-with-weaponized-desktop-shortcut-files/#:~:text=The%20digital%20defense%20perimeter%20of,deliver%20and%20execute%20malicious%20payloads.). The campaign is more than an opportunistic strike; it is an assault on India’s technological sovereignty. ## Pakistan’s Cyber-Espionage Landscape [Pakistan-supported hacking groups](https://cyble.com/threat-actor-profiles/transparenttribe/) collectively serve Islamabad’s strategic agenda. [APT 36, also known as Transparent Tribe](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/apt-profile-transparent-tribe-aka-apt36/), is primarily focused on cyber espionage against the Indian government, targeting Indian defence personnel, diplomatic missions, and critical infrastructure. Its preferred tactics have included malware-laden documents, watering-hole attacks, and social engineering through fake recruitment portals. There have been reports of a [link between other APT-based groups](https://cybersrcc.com/2025/05/02/pakistan-linked-sidecopy-hackers-escalate-indian-cyberattacks-with-curlback-rat-and-spark-rat/#:~:text=SideCopy%20is%20a%20Pakistan%2Dlinked,and%20now%2C%20critical%20infrastructure%20sectors.), such as [SideCopy, SideWinder](https://cyble.com/threat-actor-profiles/transparenttribe/), and [TransparentTribe](https://socradar.io/dark-web-profile-apt36/). These groups often share infrastructure, malware families, or operational overlaps, suggesting either coordination or common direction by Pakistan’s intelligence services, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). ## A Global Nexus: Pakistan Supporting Hackers Beyond Borders While India remains the principal target, Pakistan-based hackers have extended their reach internationally, either independently or in collaboration with other state-linked actors. Several examples illustrate this global dimension. For instance, in 2021, soon after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, Pakistan-linked hackers engaged in a campaign [against Afghan government](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-says-hackers-from-pakistan-targeted-people-in-the-previous-afghan-government/article37537222.ece) and civil society networks, consolidating Islamabad’s influence and monitoring rival factions. Similarly, there have been reported overlaps between Pakistani hacker groups and [campaigns affecting Gulf states](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/saudi-arabia-uae-face-brunt-apt-cyber-attacks-middle-east-threatcop-gwecc/), particularly those hosting large Indian diasporas. Espionage here has dual value: monitoring Indian activities abroad and gaining leverage with Gulf governments. Security firms have observed occasional alignment between Pakistani actors and broader anti-Western cyber campaigns, some with tacit [Chinese or Iranian involvement](https://www.indiandefensenews.in/2025/06/chinas-support-for-pakistan-and-iran.html#:~:text=Tuesday%2C%20June%2017%2C%202025%20by,desire%20to%20counterbalance%20Western%20influence.). These collaborations may be opportunistic rather than formal. Still, they indicate a willingness on the part of Pakistani hackers to position themselves as part of the global anti-Western cyber-espionage ecosystem. > As India promotes platforms like BOSS Linux, there should be a mandatory and more rigorous security certification framework led by CERT-In, DRDO, and the National Informatics Centre (NIC). In essence, Pakistan has fostered an environment where state priorities, cybercrime networks, and ideological motivations blur into a hybrid threat matrix. The state benefits from plausible deniability while reaping the intelligence dividends of global cyber operations. ## **Evolution of Capabilities** Over the past decade, Pakistan-based hackers have evolved from low-level disruptors into sophisticated cyber-espionage actors. Between 2010 and 2014, their operations primarily involved [website defacements](https://www.idsa.in/publisher/issuebrief/digital-war-pakistans-cyber-activity-against-india), online propaganda, and basic [phishing attacks](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/apt36-a-phishing-campaign-targeting-indian-government-entities/#:~:text=An%20investigation%20into%20the%20domain%20revealed%20a%20notable%20connection%20to,targeting%20of%20Indian%20government%20entities.) aimed at embarrassing Indian institutions. From 2015 to 2019, groups like [APT36 matured technically](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/apt36-refines-tools-attacks-indian-targets#:~:text=APT36%20Refines%20Tools%20in%20Attacks%20on%20Indian%20Targets%20APT36%20Refines,Step%2Dby%2DStep%20Cyberattack%20Capability), shifting toward credential theft, malware infiltration, and sustained surveillance of India’s defence and diplomatic networks. The period 2020 to 2024 marked a cross-platform expansion, with Pakistan-linked actors [developing Android malware](https://therecord.media/android-malware-alleged-pakistan-espionage-campaign-india#:~:text=Android%20malware%20used%20in%20six,logs%20and%20delete%20all%20contacts.) targeting Indian military personnel through fake applications and deploying advanced Windows-based trojans with layered obfuscation. By 2025, the focus had moved to Linux-specific targeting, particularly against India’s indigenous BOSS Linux system. This development signals dedicated research capacity and a state-backed commitment to penetrating critical digital infrastructure. Such a trajectory reflects Pakistan’s transition from a nuisance-level cyber actor to a structured, strategic, and offensive one that directly threatens India’s technological and national security landscape. ## Strategic Implications for India The attack on India’s BOSS Linux should not be viewed as an isolated cyber incident but as part of a broader transnational security challenge unfolding in the grey zone of hybrid warfare. Pakistan’s strategy has long employed a blend of conventional, sub-conventional, and informational tools to weaken India’s security architecture, and cyber operations now represent its newest frontier. > Given that India has one of the most advanced IT ecosystems and that private Indian cybersecurity companies have been able to track cyberattacks — particularly those targeting defence technology, finance, and telecommunications — more swiftly, there is a need for greater synergy between private and government agencies. By targeting BOSS Linux, an indigenous operating system central to India’s drive for technological self-reliance, Pakistan-linked actors are staging an attack on India’s digital sovereignty. Beyond espionage, such operations enable adversaries to penetrate government systems on a large scale, intercepting sensitive policy, defence, and diplomatic communications that could influence decision-making during crises. In times of tension or limited conflict, pre-positioned malware could be activated to paralyse communication channels, interfere with logistics, or disrupt essential services, achieving strategic disruption without crossing the threshold of open war. In this sense, the targeting of BOSS Linux is symbolic of how the digital domain has become an extension of the battlefield, where state and proxy actors engage India in an unceasing contest for advantage in the grey zone. ## Defensive Priorities for India India must adopt a multi-layered, adaptive defence posture to counter the evolving threat landscape. 1. **_Mandate Indigenous Security Certification for Government Software_** **_:_** As India promotes platforms like BOSS Linux, there should be a mandatory and more rigorous security certification framework led by CERT-In, DRDO, and the National Informatics Centre (NIC). All open-source or indigenous software adopted by the government must undergo regular red-teaming, vulnerability audits, and penetration testing, with the results feeding into an early-warning repository. 2. **_Promote Public–Private Collaboration for Threat Intelligence Sharing_** **_:_** Given that India has one of the most advanced IT ecosystems and that private Indian cybersecurity companies have been able to track cyberattacks — particularly those targeting defence technology, finance, and telecommunications — more swiftly, there is a need for greater synergy between private and government agencies. Creating a secure national platform for the real-time exchange of threat data between government and industry would enhance situational awareness and facilitate early mitigation. 3. **_Create a ‘Trusted Digital Ecosystem’ Policy_** **_:_** Taking forward the country’s ‘Make in India’ mission, agencies overseeing the cybersecurity industry should promote a secure supply chain for hardware and software used in critical infrastructure. This includes regulating the import of networking equipment, mandating transparency in source code for government procurement, incentivising local cybersecurity start-ups, overcoming obstacles like No Cost, No Commitment (NCNC), and ensuring the start-ups do not migrate to Western countries. 4. **_Institutionalise Continuous Training and Capacity Building_** **_:_** A national programme for “Cybersecurity Literacy and Leadership” should be created for civil servants, military officers, and policymakers. 5. **_Develop a Strategic Cyber Deterrence Doctrine_** **_:_** India should articulate a formal doctrine defining how cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, government systems, or defence networks would be interpreted under national security law. Establishing clear thresholds for proportional responses — whether diplomatic, economic, or cyber-retaliatory — can serve as a deterrent to persistent actors like APT36. 6. **_Establish a National Cyber Command_** **_:_** Cyber threats should be treated not merely as technical incidents but as instruments of hybrid warfare. Therefore, the government and military must upgrade the Defence Cyber Agency to a Command-level body and formulate a holistic mechanism for securing national cyberspace. ## Conclusion The exploitation of BOSS Linux by APT36 is not merely a technical episode, but a strategic signal: Pakistan’s cyber-espionage machinery is adapting to India’s countermeasures and targeting indigenous solutions once thought secure. Transparent Tribe’s evolution from Windows payloads to Linux-specific malware reveals an expanding toolkit designed to penetrate India’s technological backbone. > The government and military must upgrade the Defence Cyber Agency to a Command-level body and formulate a holistic mechanism for securing national cyberspace. Pakistan’s broader cyber ecosystem, supported by state patronage and interwoven with global hacker networks, poses a persistent threat to India’s national security. For New Delhi, the challenge is not only to neutralise these campaigns but also to reinforce trust in indigenous systems and project resilience. Cyber warfare, unlike conventional conflict, unfolds silently yet relentlessly. In this theatre, the battle is as much about perceptions of security as it is about technical breaches. India’s defensive strategy must therefore be holistic, encompassing technological, institutional, and diplomatic aspects, to ensure that its sovereignty in cyberspace remains uncompromised. **_Soumya Awasthi_** _is a Fellow with the Centre for Security, Strategy and Technology at the Observer Research Foundation._ [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/www.orfonline.org#_ftnref1) BOSS Linux is a free, Indian operating system based on Linux, created by the government to promote open-source software and offer a secure system tailored for India's needs.

India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

The recent floods across parts of India are the consequence of a wide range of factors, including excessive untimely and prolonged rainfall that occurred, coastal storm surge, water main breaks, dam failures, and more. Flooding results in instant devastation. Floods have the potential to cause significant business disruptions, food shortages, and product shortages. Companies in India have begun acknowledging such natural catastrophic risks to their business; however, concrete efforts are still nascent. Initiatives tend to focus on driving stewardship rather than addressing material risks to operations and value chains. Moreover, very few companies are quantifying their current and future climate risks in financial terms. Floods have caused the most devastation of any of these disasters, notably hitting the states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. According to reports, the floods have significantly damaged the area and resulted in an estimated economic loss of between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 crore. The severe damage caused by these floods and previous incidents like the 'Biparjoy' cyclone has raised serious concerns. It emphasises how India is vulnerable to several natural hazards due to its geographic and geographic location. These figures highlight how important catastrophe preparedness is for companies doing business in India. As the country experiences a high frequency of natural disasters, it becomes crucial for businesses to proactively address potential risks and adopt resilient strategies to protect their operations and assets. The effects of natural catastrophes on business operations can be reduced by putting into place comprehensive disaster management plans that include risk assessments, emergency response procedures, and continuity measures. Companies should consider conducting comprehensive risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities and develop contingency plans specific to their locations and industry sectors. This will enable them to better understand the potential risks they face and formulate tailored strategies for disaster preparedness and response. With the increasing frequency and severity of floods in our region, it is essential to prioritise disaster recovery planning to protect the business establishment. Floods can have a devastating impact on businesses, causing damage to infrastructure, disrupting operations, and leading to financial losses. By taking proactive measures, we can mitigate risks and enhance resilience. Here is a checklist that outlines some key considerations for businesses: 01. **Risk assessment**: Determines the frequency and severity of natural, man-made and political perils that can affect the organisation and its facilities. By identifying and quantifying these exposures, controls can be implemented to mitigate them as well as provide a cost/ benefit analysis to justify investment in these controls. 02. **Insurance coverage**: Review your insurance policies, particularly your property and business interruption coverage, to ensure they include adequate protection against flood-related damages. Engage with your insurance provider to understand the extent of coverage and any additional options available for flood insurance. 03. **Emergency response plan**: Develop a comprehensive emergency response plan specific to flooding scenarios. Clearly outline roles and responsibilities for your staff during a flood event, establish evacuation procedures, and designate assembly points or safe areas. Regularly review and update this plan as necessary. 04. **Data backup and recovery**: Implement a robust data backup and recovery system to protect your business's critical information. Store backups offsite or in the cloud to ensure accessibility even if your primary systems are compromised during a flood. Test the restoration process periodically to verify its effectiveness. 05. **Physical protection measures**: Take physical measures to safeguard your establishment from flood damage. This may include installing flood barriers or shields, sealing openings vulnerable to water ingress, elevating electrical systems and valuable equipment, and relocating critical utilities to higher levels. 06. **Communication and notification**: Establish reliable communication channels to quickly disseminate information to employees, customers, and suppliers during a flood event. Develop a communication plan that includes alternative means of contact if traditional channels are disrupted. Keep stakeholders informed about any changes in operations or disruptions to services. 07. **Inventory and asset protection**: Regularly maintain an updated inventory of your business assets, including equipment, stock, and supplies. Implement measures to protect inventory from flood damage, such as elevating storage or using waterproof containers. Develop a plan for relocating inventory in case of an impending flood. 08. **Business continuity plan**: Create a business continuity plan that outlines steps to resume operations after a flood. This includes identifying alternative locations or temporary workspaces, establishing communication channels with key stakeholders, and prioritising critical activities to minimise downtime. 09. **Employee safety and support**: Prioritise the safety and wellbeing of employees. Educate them about flood risks and safety protocols, provide training on evacuation procedures, and ensure access to necessary resources, such as emergency supplies and medical assistance. Offer support and resources for employees affected by floods, demonstrating your commitment to their welfare. 10. **Coordination with external agencies**: Coordinate response, continuity and restoration activities with local, regional and national authorities, and with compliance to statutes and regulations. Share best practices, and collectively address challenges. By implementing measures from the checklist, businesses can significantly reduce the impact of natural catastrophic (NatCat) perils and expedite the recovery process. Adaptation and preparedness are key to maintaining continuity, safeguarding assets, and protecting your employees and customers. ### We can help WTW’s Strategic Risk Consulting experts can help mitigate clients total cost of risk (TCOR).

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "What’s in today’s article? Background Key Events in 2023 India’s Unique Vulnerabilities Earthquake Risks Challenges in Resilience and Insurance Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach Conclusion Background India has witnessed a sharp rise in economic losses due to natural catastrophes, reflecting both the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and the country's vulnerabilities. In 2023, natural disasters caused an estimated $12 billion in economic losses, significantly exceeding the annual average of $8 billion over the past decade, according to a report by global insurance giant Swiss Re. Key Events in 2023 Floods in Northern India and Sikkim (July 2023): Affected Areas: Himachal Pradesh, including Shimla, and Delhi. Impact: Caused extensive damage due to heavy rains between July 10-15, disrupting daily life and infrastructure. Tropical Cyclone Biparjoy (June 2023): Landfall: Category 3 cyclone struck Kutch, Gujarat, impacting Maharashtra and Rajasthan as well. Damage: Shut down major ports like Kandla and Mundra, causing extensive damage due to strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. Tropical Cyclone Michaung (December 2023): Landfall: Hit Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Impact: Brought extreme rainfall, resulting in significant economic losses and urban disruption. India’s Unique Vulnerabilities Monsoon-Driven Floods: Contribution to Losses: Over the past two decades, floods have accounted for an average of 63% of annual economic losses. Monsoon Influence: India's geography and climate expose it to heavy rainfall during: Summer Monsoon (June-September): Causes severe flooding, as seen in Kerala (2018) and Uttarakhand (2013). Northeast Monsoon (October-December): Responsible for floods like Chennai (2015). Economic and Industrial Exposure: States like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu are highly industrialized, contributing 36.8% of India’s total industrial output. These states also face heightened risks: Gujarat: Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. Maharashtra: Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. Tamil Nadu: Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. Earthquake Risks Urban centres like Delhi and Ahmedabad face significant earthquake hazards. A major earthquake in the Himalayas or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the 2001 Bhuj earthquake in Gujarat. Challenges in Resilience and Insurance Despite the scale of economic losses, underinsurance remains a critical issue: Protection Gaps: Over 90% of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. Costliest Flood Events: Mumbai floods (2005): Losses of $5.3 billion (2024 prices) Chennai floods (2015): Losses of $6.6 billion (2024 prices) Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: Hotspot Identification: Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. Risk Assessment: Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. Reinsurance Solutions: Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. Conclusion India's rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods? Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. Q2. When was NDMA constituted? In December 2005, the Government of India enacted the Disaster Management Act, which envisaged the creation of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers.

    "title": "WTW Natural Catastrophe Review January – June 2024",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Welcome to the latest edition of WTW's Natural Catastrophe Review, a biannual publication that brings insights from our experts, including the WTW Research Network, to examine recent natural catastrophes, lessons learned and emerging trends. This edition delves into the physical, vulnerability and socioeconomic factors that contributed to the largest natural catastrophes in the first half of 2024 (Figure 1). Offering a smarter way to risk, this report goes beyond the numbers to help you navigate the complex landscape of natural catastrophe and climate risk management. For the second consecutive year, the U.S. experienced an above-average number of tornadoes, hailstorms and straight-line wind events from January to June, resulting in over US $30 billion in insurance claims. Severe flooding impacted multiple areas, including Brazil, East Africa, Dubai, Australia, China, the U.S. and Germany. A Mw7.5 earthquake struck Japan, while Taiwan experienced its strongest quake in 25 years, measuring Mw7.4. Marine heat waves triggered a global coral bleaching event, underscoring the importance of protecting “natural capital” ecosystems. Texas recorded its largest wildfire, burning 426,600 hectares. Meanwhile, severe drought in the Mediterranean exposed the vulnerability of food supply chains to climate risks. In the second half of the year, the focus will shift to the North Atlantic hurricane season, predicted to be exceptionally active due to record-warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and the anticipated transition to La Niña ( Section 4.1). Additionally, this report’s Outlook section explores the risk of solar storms as we approach the solar maximum ( Section 4.2) and provides insights into how organizations can utilize climate risk reporting for strategic planning ( Section 4.3). U.S. convective storms maintain focus on secondary perils In Section 3.1, WTW’s Scott St. George examines the fast start to the 2024 U.S. severe convective storm (SCS) season, which featured violent EF4 tornadoes in Oklahoma and Iowa as well as a derecho in Houston. This follows 2023, a year in which U.S. SCS insurance claims exceeded US $50 billion for the first time. The rising occurrence of “secondary” (or earnings) perils such as SCS, floods and wildfires has prompted insurers to intensify their efforts to better understand and manage these risks. Research plays a crucial role in analyzing these trends. For example, a study by Columbia University, in collaboration with WTW, has found that tornado outbreaks in parts of Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Mississippi are now more than twice as frequent as they were in the early 1980s. Increasing flood risks in a changing climate Flooding is another peril drawing increased attention due to escalating damages. This edition highlights flooding in Dubai ( Section 3.3), Australia ( Section 3.5), Brazil ( Section 3.6) and East Africa ( Section 3.8). Additionally, flooding resulted in major disruptions and substantial financial losses in China, Germany and the midwestern U.S. Climate scientists are increasingly linking extreme precipitation events to climate change, which enables the atmosphere to hold more moisture, resulting in heavier rainfall. For instance, researchers have found that human-induced climate change doubled the likelihood of the April to May 2024 flooding in Brazil. [1] Earthquake engineering lessons In early 2024, major earthquakes struck Japan and Taiwan. Improved resilience and preparedness measures significantly reduced human casualties and damage; however, some building and infrastructure failures still occurred. In Section 3.2, WTW’s Arash Nassirpour, Elide Pantoli and James Dalziel explain that in Japan, most failures were concentrated in areas prone to liquefaction, while in Taiwan, soft-story collapse was the primary issue. These problems highlight the ongoing need for comprehensive seismic risk assessments, retrofitting vulnerable structures, and updating construction practices and codes. Drought-induced risks in food supply chains In Section 3.7, an article by WTW’s Neil Gunn and co-authors discusses the impact of a prolonged drought in the Mediterranean region on agricultural production, focusing on the olive industry. The drought, caused by meteorological and hydrological factors, led to impaired crop yields and a 2.5-fold increase in olive oil prices, highlighting the vulnerability of food supply chains to climatic disruptions. With climate change predicted to increase drought risk in many parts of the world, businesses are advised to adopt effective strategies to assess and mitigate potential drought-related impacts on their operations and supply chains. Infrastructure vulnerabilities Several events in 2024 have demonstrated the importance of resilient infrastructure amid rising climate-related catastrophes. In Section 3.4, an article by Chloe Campo and Guy Schumann from RSS-Hydro highlights how Texas’ aging and poorly managed electricity infrastructure ignited the Panhandle fires. In Brazil, catastrophic flooding was likely exacerbated by the inadequate maintenance of flood protection systems. And flooding in Dubai showcased the significant impact natural catastrophes can have on airport infrastructure. Businesses can manage these systemic risks through comprehensive risk assessments and such tools as WTW’s Airport Risk Index. Also effective are storylines — physically consistent narratives of plausible future events. In Section 3.5, WTW’s Ben Rabb, Anna Haworth and Jessica Boyd discuss how storylines can help businesses understand and navigate complex risks, such as infrastructure disruptions, in the face of climate change. Record-breaking temperatures continue June 2023 to June 2024 brought 13 consecutive months of record-breaking global average temperatures with each month surpassing the previous records for that time of year (Figure 2). According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the global average temperature during the past 12 months (July 2023-June 2024) was 1.6°C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average. Additionally, global SSTs set records for 15 consecutive months up to June 2024. In Section 3.9, WTW’s Sarah Conway and Jamie Pollard detail how high SSTs have led to a global coral bleaching event and discuss the role of parametric insurance in protecting these vulnerable ecosystems. Transition from El Niño to La Niña The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a climate pattern characterized by periodic fluctuations in Pacific Ocean SSTs. El Niño features warmer SSTs in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, while La Niña brings cooler waters. ENSO affects global weather patterns and contributed to record-breaking global temperatures in 2023. [2] However, by early 2024, El Niño conditions waned, transitioning to the current ENSO-neutral state. Forecasts indicate a 65% chance of La Niña developing in July to September and an 85% chance of it persisting into November to January. [3] La Niña typically leads to more hurricanes in the North Atlantic by creating calmer upper-level winds that allow storms to form more easily. Coupled with record-warm SSTs, this has led to predictions of an exceptionally active 2024 North Atlantic hurricane season. In Section 4.1, James Done from the National Center for Atmospheric Research discusses these forecasts and their implications. References World Weather Attribution.

This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(ANNIRUDHA MOOKERJEE/AFP/Getty Images) For more than two months, Chinese and Indian forces have stood toe to toe on the Doklam Plateau. The standoff is just the latest manifestation of a border dispute that began long before Chinese soldiers tried to extend a road through the contested region June 16 -- and one that extends well past the area in question. Along the thousands of kilometers of sinuous border between China and India lie three main points of contention: Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The regions are the most likely sites of a military confrontation between China and India, and each presents its own set of strategic considerations....

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

The report on international religious freedom released on Wednesday said that in 2023, senior U.S. officials continued to \"raise concerns about religious freedom issues\" with their Indian counterparts. Human rights experts say India has seen a rise in attacks on minorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently won a third term, and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \"In India, we see a concerning increase in anti-conversion laws, hate speech, demolitions of homes and places of worship for members of minority faith communities,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, opens new tab when the report was released, in a rare direct rebuke of India. Criticism of India by the U.S. is usually restrained due to close economic ties and New Delhi's importance for Washington to counter China, political analysts say. The U.S. report listed dozens of incidents. Among them was a fatal shooting of a security official and three Muslims on a train near Mumbai by a suspect who was a railway security official. A probe by Indian authorities into that case is ongoing and the suspect was in jail, according to the Indian Express newspaper. The report cited examples of attacks against Muslims based on allegations that Muslim men were participating in the slaughter of cows or beef trading. The Indian embassy in Washington had no immediate comment. The Indian government denies discriminating against minorities, and says its welfare policies - like food subsidy schemes and electrification drives - aim to benefit all Indians.

Hindu and Christian places of worship were destroyed in Manipur. Citing a local tribal leaders' forum, the report said over 250 churches were burnt down, more than 200 people were killed and over 60,000 were displaced. Hindus make up about 80% of India's 1.4 billion population. Muslims include 14% and Christians over 2%.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more.

India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

Throughout its history, Indian traders and missionaries plying its waters for Malaysia and Indonesia brought Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism to the region with them. Those ties have lingered into the present, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has touched upon their shared cultural and religious connections through soft power diplomacy as part of his government's Act East policy....

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 October 2024 By Sema Hasan, Senior Policy Analyst Increasing Abuses against Religious Minorities in India Introduction Religious freedom conditions in India have continued to worsen throughout 2024, particularly in the months prior to and immediately following the country’s national elections. In addition to the enforcement of discriminatory state-level legislation and propagation of hateful rhetoric, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government made a concerted effort to implement election promises that negatively and disproportionately impacted religious minorities and their ability to practice their faith. Such promises included enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), inaugurating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and introducing a national code to replace religion-specific personal laws. Each action was justified by government officials as necessary to protect India’s “cultural [and] linguistic heritage”—a common euphemism for Hindu supremacy, often at the expense of religious minorities. This report provides an overview of the various religious freedom violations that have taken place in India during 2024. It focuses on changes to the country’s legal framework, including the strengthening of discriminatory legislation like state-level anti-conversion and anti-terrorism laws, as well as the implementation of the CAA and the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). It also examines the increasing frequency of attacks against religious minorities and their advocates, including the targeting of places of worship. Laws and Other Challenges to Religious Freedom at the National Level The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) In May 2024, the Indian government published the rules for implementing the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), fulfilling a long-anticipated BJP campaign promise. Amending the country’s 1955 Citizenship Act, the CAA established a religious criterion for fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants (from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, or Christian communities) fleeing neighboring Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The law excludes Muslim refugees, including Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka. The act states that an individual must have lived or worked in India prior to December 31, 2014, in order to apply for citizenship. www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov Stephen Schneck Chair Eric Ueland Vice Chair Commissioners Mohamed Elsanousi Maureen Ferguson Susie Gelman Vicky Hartzler Asif Mahmood Meir Soloveichik Erin D. Singshinsuk Executive Director USCIRF’s Mission To advance international freedom of religion or belief, by independently assessing and unflinchingly confronting threats to this fundamental right. 2 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Critics argue that the CAA violates the Indian constitution’s principles prohibiting religious discrimination and its guarantees of equal protection under the law. Mass protests followed the initial announcement in 2019, in which hundreds were injured and thousands arrested—some of whom remained in detention as of September 2024, including Umar Khalid, Meeran Haider, and Sharjeel Imam. The recent announcement of the implementation rules initiated a surge of new protests as well as a number of petitions challenging the CAA before the Supreme Court. Several Indian states have expressed opposition to the CAA. In 2019, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh all moved resolutions against the CAA. In February 2024, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu stressed that he would not allow implementation of the CAA in that state, as he would “stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan brethren.” Similarly, in March, the chief minister of West Bengal voiced her opposition to the act, arguing that it would be used to “turn legal citizens into foreigners.” Kerala was the first state to legally challenge the CAA and in March renewed its 2020 plea before the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the law’s classification based on religion and country is discriminatory. In June, the Madhya Pradesh government granted Indian citizenship to three applicants under the CAA. National Register of Citizens (NRC) Human rights advocates argue that the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in combination with the CAA, would allow the Indian government to expel those it deemed noncitizens, posing particular risk to the country’s Muslim population. The government first piloted the NRC in Assam in 2018, when it sought to separate Indian citizens from “undocumented immigrants” living in that state. The NRC requires residents to prove they or their ancestors had entered Assam prior to March 24, 1971, or face exclusion from the register. In 2019, the Assam government published its list of names of those it considered Indian citizens according to the NRC, omitting 1.9 million names. Of these 1.9 million, an estimated 700,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Bengali Hindus, and 200,000 were from the Assamese Hindu groups Koch-Rajbongshi, Das, Kalita, and Sarma. In July 2024, the Assam government ordered police to cease referring people entitled to Indian citizenship— under the CAA—to Foreigners’ Tribunals, which function as quasi-judicial bodies that authorities task with determining whether an individual is a “suspected foreigner.” Despite this order, police in Assam that same month, in conjunction with the Foreigners’ Tribunals, declared 28 Muslims as “non-citizens” and sent them to a deportation center. In September, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that all individuals must submit an NRC application in order to receive identity cards. New Delhi India USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 3 Expropriation and Demolition of Places of Worship and Muslim Property Since the beginning of 2024, Indian authorities have facilitated the expropriation of places of worship, including the construction of Hindu temples on the sites of mosques. Most notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in January, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Indian authorities had constructed the temple atop the ruins of the Babri Masjid, which a Hindu mob had demolished in 1992 in their belief that it marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site was long contested; India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the mosque’s destruction was an “egregious violation” of the law and yet granted the site to Hindus while offering Muslims a separate plot of land to construct a new mosque—which remains unbuilt as of September 2024. The days following the temple’s January 2024 consecration were marked by a series of attacks and other instances of intolerance against religious minorities across six states. In each instance, violence erupted following Hindu nationalist processions through predominantly Muslim neighbors. In Maharashtra, violence broke out along Mira Road, where police stood by as mobs vandalized dozens of Muslim-owned shops. Several reports indicate that the police arrested Muslim youths, despite receiving dozens of complaints against the actions of the Hindu mob. In the aftermath of the Mira Road violence, municipal authorities returned with bulldozers to demolish structures they deemed illegal. Commonly referred to as “bulldozer justice,” state authorities have repeatedly used bulldozers to demolish Muslim property under the guise of removing “illegal” structures, including homes, businesses, and places of worship. In February, for example, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the 600-year-old Akhoondji Mosque, alleging that the building was an illegal encroachment. The mosque’s imam argued that he did not receive written notice before the demolition. The DDA has also announced its intention to demolish 20 religious structures in the forested areas of Sanjay Van, including 16 Muslim shrines. A court order claimed that Delhi “already had sufficient dargahs and temples” and that the forest needed restoration. The same month, in Uttarakhand, the demolition of a mosque and Muslim seminary by police and government officials sparked deadly clashes and an internet shutdown. In July, the DDA demolished the Faizyab Mosque and Madrassa in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area. Places of Worship Act Beyond demolitions, the government has expropriated several mosques for alternative purposes, directly violating India’s Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. The 1991 act froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed in August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith. While the act does not apply to the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, it extends protection to all other places of worship. Despite this law, an Indian court ruled in February that Hindus can worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, which Hindus claim rests on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The same month, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav called for the repeal of the Places of Worship Act, calling it “unconstitutional.” Waqf Amendment Bill In addition, many Muslims have expressed concern regarding the Indian government’s introduction of the Waqf Amendment Bill in August, which seeks to repeal the 1995 Waqf Act. A waqf is an endowment (movable or immovable) that Muslims can give for a specific pious or charitable purpose, according to Islamic tradition. Once registered as a waqf, such property—which may include land, graveyards, or buildings—is deemed nontransferable and held in perpetuity as such. All mosques in India are considered waqf properties, under the management of Muslim bodies in every state, known as Waqf Boards. The 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to broaden the government’s regulatory authority over these endowments and proposes the mandatory inclusion of non-Muslim members on Waqf Boards. It also seeks to prohibit the designation of a given property as a waqf based on its owner’s oral declaration alone. Legal experts and Muslim leaders argue that these provisions would erode their community’s autonomy over its own religious institutions. The introduction of this legislation follows the increased proliferation of disinformation regarding the distribution of wealth among India’s Muslim communities, including derogatory comments that Prime Minister Modi made during the national election. 4 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 State and Local Laws Impacting Religious Minorities Uniform Civil Code and Personal Status Laws Since 2019, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have articulated their intention to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to overrule existing personal laws that are highly integrated with religious beliefs. Such personal laws include areas such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession. Critics argue that a UCC would contradict secular principles while failing to adequately represent the needs and values of the country’s myriad and diverse religious communities. In February, the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand passed a state-level UCC bill, establishing a uniform set of rules on personal status law that includes marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. This bill is widely considered to represent a template for other states to adopt. The UCC sets the minimum age for marriage at 18. While Hindu and secular laws set age restrictions for men and women, there are no such limitations for Muslims and other communities. Some Muslim communities have characterized the UCC as a threat to Islamic practices, preferring to observe Shari’a as the basis for personal law, and some Sikh organizations have similarly rejected it, arguing that it “undermines Sikh identity.” The UCC further requires “live-in” relationships to be registered within a month and establishes criminal punishments, including six months in jail, for failing to do so. Such provisions would allow for further policing of interfaith couples, who already face risks including threats of violence from family members. In July, for example, the Uttarakhand high court directed police to provide protection to an interfaith couple in a live-in relationship and instructed them to register under the UCC. The couple reported receiving threats from their parents about their relationship. Anti-Conversion Laws In addition to the UCC and other legislation, authorities frequently used state-level policies throughout the first part of 2024, including anti-conversion laws, to target religious minorities across India. As USCIRF previously reported, 12 of India’s 28 states currently maintain anti\u0002conversion laws and enforce them to varying degrees. These laws prohibit conversion under circumstances that far exceed cases of coercion, and they are often punishable by hefty fines and prison terms. Authorities frequently enforce such laws under the pretext of preventing so-called “love jihad”—a conspiracy theory that claims Muslim men target and seduce Hindu women for conversion to Islam—while in effect targeting interfaith relationships. Since the beginning of the year, authorities have arrested dozens of Christians on allegations of conducting or participating in forced conversions. In June, for example, police in Uttar Pradesh detained 13 Christians, including four pastors; in July, seven Christians faced accusations of violating the state’s anti-conversion law in two separate incidents. That same month, government officials from Uttar Pradesh tabled a bill that would strengthen the state’s anti-conversion law, including expanding the punishment for conversion to life imprisonment, allowing anyone to file a First Instance Report (FIR) against suspected violators, and making religious conversion a nonbailable offense. Several other states made similar efforts to introduce or strengthen existing anti-conversion laws. In February, for example, the state of Chhattisgarh announced it would introduce legislation to address “illegal conversion,” claiming that Christian pastors had forcibly converted Hindus. In February, the Assam government passed the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Bill, which bans individuals or groups from performing “non\u0002scientific” healing, such as prayer, to treat illnesses. The chief minister of Assam further noted his intention to restrict Christian evangelism and conversion in the state with the bill. In April, the government of Gujarat issued a circular mandating that Hindus wishing to convert to Buddhism, Sikhism, or Jainism obtain approval from their district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. In June, the BJP-led government in Rajasthan withdrew its 2008 anti-conversion law in favor of new legislation aimed at “curbing alleged cases of ‘love jihad’” and religious conversion. Additionally, as of August, appeals challenging the constitutionality of anti\u0002conversion laws were pending in seven states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Anti-Cow Slaughter Laws India’s constitution directs states to take steps to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, considered sacred in Hinduism. As a result, 20 of India’s 28 states currently enforce anti-cow slaughter laws. Vigilante groups and self-proclaimed “cow protectors” frequently exploit such laws to target religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits. USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 5 An estimated dozen attacks involving “cow vigilantism” took place following India’s national elections in June. In August, for example, a group of cow vigilantes beat a Muslim migrant worker to death, falsely accusing him of having eaten beef. A day later, a group of Hindu men violently attacked a 72-year-old Muslim man because they believed he was carrying beef in his bag. The same month, a group of “cow protectors” shot and killed a 19-year-old Hindu student because they thought he was a Muslim smuggling cows. While arrests were made in each of these cases, perpetrators of such attacks often operate with impunity; they rarely face punishment and are often released on bail within 24 hours. Other Significant Religious Freedom Challenges across India Hate Speech, Misinformation and Disinformation In the leadup to the June 2024 elections, political officials increasingly wielded hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims and other religious minorities. Prime Minister Modi repeatedly claimed that the opposition party would “wipe out [the] Hindu faith from the country” and had plans to make Hindus “second class citizens in their own country.” He perpetuated hateful stereotypes about Muslims, referring to them as “infiltrators.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah echoed these statements and insisted falsely that opposition leaders would impose Shari’a if elected—despite the fact that the opposition election manifesto included no mention of Shari’a or Muslims. Additionally, misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech by Indian government officials frequently fuel and incite cow vigilantism and other attacks against religious minorities. The attacks against Muslims in Mira Road following the inauguration of the Ram Temple in January, for example, erupted following inflammatory speeches by two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain. Rane reportedly openly threatened the Muslim community, using offensive language and urging the Hindu community to “ignite and retaliate.” While First Instance Reports (FIRs) were filed against Rane and Jain, Mumbai police argued in July that the use of terms like “jihadis,” “Rohingya,” and “Bangladeshis” were not aimed at the Muslim community and therefore did not fall under Section 295A of the penal code. The same month, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about an increase in hate speech targeting Rohingya refugees and the Indian government’s role in arbitrary mass detention and forcible return of that community to Burma. Following Rane and Jain’s speeches, BJP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) T. Raja Singh gave a 40-minute speech in February stoking religious tensions, in which he openly called for violence against Muslims and for the further demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura. Singh claimed that Muslims were facilitating the forceful conversion of Hindus and repeatedly referred to Rohingya and Bangladeshi Muslims as “illegal.” He encouraged his audience to be “prepared to fight for the protection of our country and religion” and to fight against “love jihad,” forced conversion, and cow slaughter. Attacks against Religious Minorities In March, a group of UN experts raised alarm about the level of violence and hate crimes against religious minorities in the leadup to national elections, including vigilante violence, targeted and arbitrary killings, demolition of property, and harassment. They called on the Indian government to fulfill its obligation to prohibit religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and violence. From January to March 161 incidents of violence against Christians in India were reported—47 of which occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh. Such incidents ranged from violent attacks on churches and prayer meetings to physical assaults, harassment, and false allegations of forced conversion. Muslims continued to be targeted, as well. In March, a group of Hindus in Gujarat violently attacked foreign Muslim university students as they gathered for prayer during Ramadan. The university subsequently issued new guidelines, instructing students not to pray in common spaces. Moreover, following the election results, during which the BJP lost its national majority, at least 28 attacks against Muslims occurred from June to August. Religious educational institutions were also subjected to harassment and targeting. In February, for example, Hindu organizations entered a Catholic school in Assam and demanded instructors cease using Christian images and symbols. In March, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment striking down a previous ruling on the governance of madrasas, effectively banning Islamic schools in that state and ordering the public school enrollment of students whom the closures had impacted. 6 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Crackdown on Civil Society and Faith-Based Organizations In 2024 the government of India has expanded its tactics of repression to target religious minorities and their advocates abroad. Journalists, academics, and civil society organizations documenting India’s religious freedom violations have reported facing denial of consular services, including the revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards as well as threats of violence and surveillance. In April, international reporting linked an official in India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to the 2023 assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist in New York. Additionally, Indian authorities have repeatedly used discriminatory legislation to target religious communities and those advocating on their behalf. Authorities continued to exploit antiterror and financing laws, including the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to crack down on civil society organizations, religious minorities, human rights defenders, and journalists reporting on religious freedom. The UAPA was enacted in 1967 but amended in 2019, allowing the government to designate individuals as “terrorists” without due process. The law vaguely defines “unlawful activity” as any action “intended to disrupt India’s sovereignty, integrity or security,” including “disruptive speech.” In 2024, several religious minorities and human rights activists have continued to face detention without trial under the UAPA, including Hany Babu and Rona Wilson. Academic and human rights activist GN Saibaba, whom authorities detained under the UAPA in 2017 for criticizing state violence against religious minorities, was ultimately released in March but described how police had abused him, tortured him, and denied him medical care while in custody. Similarly, organizations that document and advocate for religious freedom continue to face harassment and, in some cases, are forced to shut down operations. Like the UAPA, authorities have used India’s Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to obstruct the work of civil society organizations. FCRA regulates access to foreign funds for individuals and organizations and prohibits receipt of foreign funds for “any activities [deemed] detrimental to the national interest” of India. The law requires nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to apply for FCRA licenses to received foreign funding, but authorities can readily revoke such licenses. In April, India’s Home Ministry canceled the FCRA licenses of five NGOs, preventing them from using existing funds. Those NGOs included the Church of North India (CNI) Synodical Board of Social Service, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, and Evangelical Fellowship of India. In total, the Indian government has canceled over 20,000 FCRA registrations since 2012. Replacing India’s Criminal Code In July, the Indian government moved to replace its colonial-era criminal laws with three new laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA). These laws replaced the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1872 Indian Evidence Act, respectively. Human rights groups argue that the enforcement of these new laws may have exacerbated the targeting of religious minorities and their advocates. Such legislation may pose an additional threat to freedom of expression, association, and right to a free trial, particularly for religious minorities. The BNS specifically adds a new provision criminalizing “acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India” and increases the minimum punishment from three years to seven. It also expands the criminalization of the promotion of “enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion” to include electronic communications. Reporting indicates that this provision has already served as a pretext for targeting journalists who reported on an alleged mob lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh. The BNSS additionally allows for police to seek 15-day detention of an accused individual at any time before they have completed 40–60 days of the allowed remand period. UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief. Professional Staff Michael Ardovino Policy Analyst Susan Bishai Senior Policy Analyst Mollie Blum Policy Analyst Guillermo Cantor Director of Research and Policy Elizabeth K.

The Indian government continues to repress and restrict religious communities through the enforcement of discriminatory legislation like anti-conversion laws, cow slaughter laws, and antiterrorism laws. In doing so, authorities have arbitrarily detained individuals highlighting violations of religious freedom, including religious leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, without due process—in some cases for years. Indian officials have repeatedly employed hateful and derogatory rhetoric and misinformation to perpetuate false narratives about religious minorities, inciting widespread violence, lynchings, and demolition of places of worship. In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in particularly severe religious freedom violations. This report further outlines a number of policy recommendations that the U.S. government can take to address religious freedom violations in India, including issuing targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, conditioning arms sales based on improved religious freedom conditions, and incorporating religious freedom priorities into bilateral meetings with Indian government counterparts.",

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power.

Organizations like the VHP are on the upswing as Hindu nationalism grows in India. (NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

(VYACHESLAV OSELEDKO/AFP/Getty Images) ## Highlights - _Central Asia has restructured its economic links over the past decade, as China has outpaced Russia in the region on trade, investment and infrastructure development._ - _Russia maintains its influence in Central Asia, however, and China so far has been careful to make sure its economic initiatives in the region largely complement Moscow's interests._ - _While China and Russia have worked to mitigate potential differences in Central Asia, several factors potentially could cause problems between Moscow and Beijing in the years to come._ Central Asia has undergone a significant economic transformation in recent years as trade and investment in the region have shifted away from Russia and toward China. Russia remains a major economic force in Central Asia, and China's rise in the region complements its interests in many ways -- or at least doesn't directly contradict them. But Central Asia's growing economic dependence on China and Beijing's increasing political and security influence in the region could foster increased tensions between the two powers....

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen from politically sensitive targets, and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents from the Offices of the Dalai Lama, and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing sensitive information on citizens of numerous third party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business information, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while operating core servers located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and motivation of the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some of the associations of the attackers through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an eight month, collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and SecDev) and the Shadowserver Foundation. The investigation employed a fusion methodology, combining technical interrogation techniques, data analysis, and field research, to track and uncover the Shadow cyber espionage network.

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "full_text": "If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up...",

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance Washington could start imposing tariffs against a wider...
