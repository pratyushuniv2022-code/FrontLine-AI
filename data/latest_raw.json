Sources](https://wikileaks.org/wikileaks.org#submit_help_tips) [After Submitting](https://wikileaks.org/wikileaks.org#submit_help_after) ### Contact If you need help using Tor you can contact WikiLeaks for assistance in setting it up using our simple webchat available at: [https://wikileaks.org/talk](https://wikileaks.org/talk) If you can use Tor, but need to contact WikiLeaks for other reasons use our secured webchat available at **http://wlchatc3pjwpli5r.onion** We recommend contacting us over Tor if you can. [How to contact WikiLeaks?](https://wikileaks.org/wikileaks.org#submit_help_contact) [What is Tor?](https://wikileaks.org/wikileaks.org#submit_help_tor) [Tips for Sources](https://wikileaks.org/wikileaks.org#submit_help_tips) [After Submitting](https://wikileaks.org/wikileaks.org#submit_help_after) ### Tor [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to. In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor. #### Tails If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called [Tails](https://tails.boum.org). Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.

Please review these basic guidelines. #### 1\\. Contact us if you have specific problems If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please [contact us](https://wikileaks.org/wikileaks.org#submit_help_contact). In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations. #### 2\\. What computer to use If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use [Tails](https://tails.boum.org) to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer. #### 3\\. Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.

Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations. #### 2\\. Act normal If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour. #### 3\\. Remove traces of your submission If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used. In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media. If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion. #### 4\\. If you face legal action If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at [https://www.couragefound.org](https://www.couragefound.org). # Submit documents to WikiLeaks WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives. The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors.

The e-mails date between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods. ## IND/INDIA/SOUTH ASIA Released on 2012-10-18 17:00 GMT | Email-ID | 671142 | | Date | 2010-08-13 12:30:20 | | From | dialogbot@smtp.stratfor.com | | To | translations@stratfor.com | IND/INDIA/SOUTH ASIA Table of Contents for India \\-\\-\\-------------------------------------------------------------------- 1) Indian Media Highlights 11-12 Aug 10 2) Iranian Commentary Argues South Asia Issue Becoming Important in US-UK Relations Commentary by Maede Karimi Qahrudi: \"South Asia Link Between United States, Britain\" 3) Taliban Commander Says Attacks on US, NATO To Continue in Ramadan Report by Mazhar Tufail: \"Destructive Floods Cut NATO Supply; the Taliban Pleased\" 4) Pakistan Press Nawa-e Waqt 12 Aug 10 To request additional processing, contact the OSC Customer Center at (800) 205-8615 or OSCinfo@rccb.osis.gov. 5) Pakistani Commentary Argues Analysts Incorrect To Predict Afghanistan Division Commentary by Salim Safi: \"Possibilities of Division of Pakistan and Afghanistan, Several Other Aspects\" 6) Pakistan Editorial Views US Defense Secretarys Proposal to Reduce Size of Army Editorial: Shrinking US role 7) Us Open To Review Taliban Delisting Process -- Holbrooke \"Us Open To Review Taliban Delisting Process -- Holbrooke\" -- KUNA Headline 8) Indian Army Kills 3 Militant 'Believed To Be Affiliated' With LT in Kashmir Report by Inayat Jehangir: \"3 Militants Killed in Bandipora Encounter\" 9) Social Activist Says Maoists Ready for Talks 'If' Killing of Azad Probed Report by Raktima Bose: Maoists Ready for Talks If Azad Killing Is Probed, Says Agnivesh 10) Malaysia To Stop Issuing Landing Visas August 15 Unattributed article from the \"Taiwan\" page: \"Malaysia To Stop Issuing Landing Visas August 15\" 11) Mahindra Gets Nod to Take Over Ssangyong 12) Visa Privileges for Malaysian Visitors To Remain in Place Unattributed article from the \"Ta iwan\" page: \"Visa Privileges for Malaysian Visitors To Remain in Place\" 13) Restoring The Middle Class 14) Fate Of Three Russia Tourists In North India Flood Zone Unknown 15) Northeast Indian Press 1-4 August 2010 The following is a selection of highlights from the Notheast Indian press on 1-4 August 2010, to include reports, articles, editorials, and commentaries pertaining to a) proliferation/uranium smuggling, b) dissent/terrorism/insurgency/instability, c) migration/population shifts/cross-border issues, and d) narcotics/drug trafficking 16) India extends visa of controversial Bangladeshi writer by one year 17) Bangladesh Press 12 Aug 10 The following is a selection of highlights from Bangladesh press on 12 Aug 10 18) Bangladesh Relaxes Norms To Help India Expedite Border Fencing in Assam Report by Umanand Jaiswal: B angla Agrees To Ignore Norm - Fence Construction on Kushiara Bank To Spare Karimganj Town Bifurcation 19) Relations between Belarus and India are characterized by 20) Malaysia To Stop Issuing Landing Visas Aug. 15 By Hsieh Chia-chen and Sofia Wu 21) Chhattisgarh Police, IAF Bicker Over Chopper Use in Anti-Maoist Operation Report by Sujan Dutta: IAF, Cops Squabble in Maoist Corridor - Police Claim Force Refusal To Fly Led to Troopers Death 22) Indian Editorial Views Visa Fee Hike To 'Accelerate' Outsourcing of Jobs From US Editorial: US Politicians are Trying To Save Their Jobs 23) Lawmakers say commercial interests behind linking of 'superbug' to India 24) Indian Firm Targets To Invest $25 Million in Zambia Unattributed report: \"Safintra To Invest $25m in Zambia\" 25) Conflict of Laws Makes Govt's War Crimes Trial Venture Questionable Article by M.

Nuclear Liability Bill : \"Buckling under pressure\" from the BJP, the government on 11 August decided to incorporate several changes suggested by the Opposition in the civil nuclear liability bill and bring a redrafted legislation next week with the hope that the move would pave the way for its passage in the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament itself (The Indian Express, SAP20100812534004).

Before this meeting, Cameron called himself as a supporter of America. He said that UK and America have a mutual and clear agenda and some of the activities of the UK are based on these close relations. Cameron's visit to India and the extensive relations (with India) can be counted as a continuation of British policy to have strategic relations with that country. His views about Pakistan and the revelation of documents on the Afghan war, which happened simultaneously, are interesting points. In his trip, Cameron said that Pakistan is an exporter of terrorism to Afghanistan, India, and other regions of the world. It happened in a situation when the tense relations between India and Pakistan are evident to everyone. Most of the countries do not express their position against either of these two countries while they visit the other. Moreover, they have tried to maintain a balance between these countries and have even balanced their visits to India and Pakistan. According to the disclosed documents on America's war in Afghanistan, the intelligence agencies of Pakistan have cooperated with the Taliban. Though there is no clear reason as to why these documents were disclosed, there is a possibility that it was aimed at the pressurizing of Pakistan by the American authorities and the creation of a sense of responsibility in that country to fight against terrorism. The Americans have made this allegation through an intentional or accidental revelation of the documents. In his meeting with Obama, Cameron did not give any other example that could be more important than Afghanistan to describe the level of cooperation between London and Washington in favor of their national interests. This point proves two issues. One is that South Asia has become important for the British authorities. Second, the UK has understood that it needs to cooperate with the US in order to maintain its power and ability to manage world affairs. South Asia is a region that is under the focus of America and close cooperation between the US and UK on South Asian issues has obviously increased since Cameron became the British prime minister.

Qari Ziaur Rehman, a Kunar-based Taliban comma nder said, while talking to The News by telephone from an undisclosed location in Afghanistan, that it was really good news for us that NATO supply line through Pakistan has been cut because of devastating floods. Of course, we were extremely saddened by the loss of precious human lives and the colossal economic losses because of devastation caused by floods in Pakistan, he said. However, we were also very happy that NATO supply line had been cut, the Kunar-based Taliban commander said. The Taliban commander said that they were now in much better position in the ongoing Kandahar Operation of the US and allied forces in south Afghanistan. He said that NATO supplies, being transported through Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa and Balochistan Provinces of Pakistan, had been completely cut off by the floods. He said that it was very beneficial for us. A major military operation, the linchpin of McChrystal's strategy, was underway in Kandahar these days, using the bulk of 30,000 reinforcements sent by US President Barack Obama, the Kunar-based Taliban commander said. He said that, in spite of the holy month of Ramadan our operations and the attacks on the US and NATO forces as well as other foreigners, were not going to come down. He said: \"We are will continue with the same thrust. The Kunar-based Taliban commander said that the Taliban would soften their actions only to such an extent that they would not target the foreign women. He said that in addition to the US and NATO troops, a list of foreigners working in Afghanistan, including big businessmen of India, had been compiled for attacks. Zia added that the Indians were also our prime target because they were also close to the United States, and were doing good business in our homeland. He said that markets in major Afghan cities, particularly Kabul, Jalalabad, and Kandahar, were bursting with the Indian music CDs and cassettes because of the presence of Indian businessmen. Zia said that Indian culture was being promoted in Afghanistan with the connivance of Hamid Karzai, who as part of a well-knit plan wanted obscenity to prevail in Afghanistan like the 1970s. But the mujahidin would never let him do so, he added. (Description of Source: Rawalpindi Jang in Urdu  The War, an influential, largest circulation newspaper in Pakistan, circulation of 300,000.

However, the Bonn Conference elected Karzai as president. Thus, the National Alliance chief was isolated and the other components of the alliance, including the Tajik Panjshiris, secured posts in the Karzai government. In this way, the Northern Alliance was dismantled in early 2002 once and for all. During this time, Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani served as opposition leader. However, his closest colleagues in the Northern Alliance, such as Abdullah Abdullah, Younus Qanuni, and Marshal Fahi m, occupied important ministries in Karzai government. Similarly, Professor Sayyaf, Karim Khalili, and Rashid Dostum were also part of this government. When, at the dictate of the United States, Karzai removed Marshal Fahim and Younus Qanuni, they joined forces with the opposition. However, Abdullah still remained number two in the Karzai government. Later, when Karzai removed Abdullah, he also joined the opposition. However, now when Qanuni is the speaker of the National Assembly, Marshal Fahim has joined the Karzai camp, acquiring the post of vice president. Thus, not only the Northern Alliance but even its Panjshiri clique has disintegrated. After burying the alliance in 2002 forever, other parts of the alliance, such as Rashid Dostum, Professor Sayyaf, Karim Khalili, and Waheedullah Sabaon, are now with Karzai and against their former leader Professor Rabbani. In Afghanistan's politics and journalism, the word Northern Alliance has become obsolete sin ce 2002. Even the Taliban are not using this word for their opponents because they know that there is no alliance with this name in Afghanistan. However, it is ironic that the word is still being constantly used in Pakistani politics and journalism. The statements and decisions of every person who was in this alliance are being linked with the alliance. Policies are being made (in Pakistan) on the basis of a thing (Northern Alliance) that has no existence at all. Now, even some analysts have started to predict the disintegration of Afghanistan on the basis of this presumption. For their part, when seeing the word Northern Alliance in our statements and speeches, the politicians and journalists of Afghanistan ridicule us. Similarly, the statements of Amrollah Saleh, who was a colleague of Ahmad Shah Masud in the past, and was made the Afghan intelligence chief with the blessings of Britain, India, and the United States after 9/11, are being used as a basis for th e disintegration of Afghanistan. This is although Amrollah is not a political leader, nor is anybody paying heed to him in Afghanistan. He had importance as long as he was the Afghan intelligence chief. If any chief of a powerful agency, like the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence), cannot become a political leader in Pakistan after his retirement, then how can Amrollah Saleh becom e one in Afghanistan? However, using his boastful utterances as a basis for their analysis, some of our analysts are trying to prove the imminent division of Afghanistan. More ironic is the fact that these analysts introduce Saleh as the former adviser to the Afghan president for security, although he has never occupied this post. He was the chief of Afghan intelligence and Hamid Karzai removed him from the same position. Here the logic is very simple. If the division of Pakistan on ethnic grounds is (God forbid) possible, then the question of Afghanistan's division on these lines can certai nly be discussed.

That day draws nearer, sooner than expected because the country has accumulated an unsustainable debt of trillions of dollars in pursuit of aggressive designs, like the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. And, adding to the military's woes has been the economic crunch that is impacting the lives of American citizens and, thus, would not permit of such reckless spending much longer. Defence Secretary Robert Gates' proposal to reduce the size of the army by abolishing one of the ten commands to effect a saving of $100 billion over the next five years points to that compulsion. The recommendation, if accepted, would inevitably result in a reduced American presence in the region, apart from wider implications at the global political and military levels. Evidently, Washington's commitment in Afghanistan wo uld fall several notches lower, notwithstanding its declarations to the contrary, and so would its avowals of long lasting friendship with us. However, considering other developments that can be traced directly to American encouragement, there is not much ground for satisfaction for the people of Pakistan. The insistence on India playing a substantial role in Afghanistan as a stabilising force, once the US troops have left, forebodes more troubles for Pakistan. The plan is ill conceived; the Indian equation with the minority Northern Alliance would hardly please the Pashtun majority and would not be conducive to peace and stability in the country. For Pakistan, New Delhi's attempts at muddying the waters in Balochistan and FATA would suggest constant threats to its integrity. Islamabad must underline these dangers in contacts with US officials. The only good for us under the circumstances would be for the foreign occupation in Afghanistan to end and let the Afghans and, if n eed be, its Muslim neighbours - Pakistan, Iran and Turkey - to come forward and help. Secretary Gates' idea is based on the premise that the military has grown 'unwieldy and costly'. It would eliminate the Joint Forces Command that employs 5000 people, reduce the strength of Generals and Admirals by 50 and cut down the number of support contractors by 10 percent. Its acceptance, favoured by President Obama, is contingent upon approval by the Congress where it is likely to encounter opposition from members to whose constituencies the bulk of the employees belong.

We re-examined this policy starting late last year,\" said Holbrooke in a press briefing. Afghan President Hamid Karzai announced this week he planned to ask the United Nations to remove up to 50 former Taliban leaders from a terrorism blacklist.The Security Council Resolution 1267 was passed in 1999 and was designed because of Taliban noncompliance with certain United Nations resolutions. Holbrooke made clear that \"to get a name delisted takes Security Council approval, which means the five permanent members must do this, must agree\" and mentioned that he visited New York last week to talk to the Austrian ambassador to the U.N., who is in charge of this process for the U.N. Security Council, and to various other U.N. officials and to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.\"President Karzai would like to have names dropped from the list. We agree to do that on a case-by-case process. We will not support a blanket ending of this list,\" he added while stating that \"there are people on it who are dangerous threats to the United Sta tes and our allies, and there are people on it who are actors in movements which threaten to kill members of the coalition.\" Holbrooke affirmed that \"this is not a one-time-only event, it is an ongoing process, and the U.S. is not in charge of it. The U.N. is. But we are working on it, along with them.\" \"Our position on reconciliation should be equally clear. We support Afghan-led reconciliation,\" he added.Holbrooke affirmed that the Kabul conference on July 20 \"is not going to end the war in Afghanistan.\" The Afghan government is expected to present a plan to improve development, governance and security during a conference co-chaired by the United Nations. While it is not a pledging conference, donor countries are expected to align their assistance with the proposals put forward in the meeting.Assistant Secretary of State for public diplomacy Philip Crowley told reporters that a \"major element\" of Secretary of State Hillary Clint on upcoming trip is to participate in the Kabul conference next week.Holbrooke, who just came back from a trip to South East Asia, will leave again tomorrow for Germany, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India on addition to London on his way back to Washington.

However, the militants responded by opening firing towards the Army positions.The firing was retaliated by the troops, triggering off a fierce encounter that lasted several hours, they said adding three unidentified militants were killed in the gun battle.Srinagar-based Defence Spokesman Lt Colonel J S Brar confirmed the killing of militants but said further details about the operation were awaited.'In an operation in the dense Bandipora forests, our troops have killed three terrorists and recovered three AK rifles, 15 magazines and 480 rounds of ammunition besides other war like stores,\" Lt Col Brar said.The sources said it would take at least another 24 hours for the Army to bring down bodies of the slain militants and the weapons recovered from their possession to the nearest police station as scene of the encounter was deep inside the forest area, almost 45 kilometres from Bandipora.They said identification of the militants would take some time but they were believed to be affiliated with Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), which has a strong presence in the area.The success for the Army comes just two days after militants killed three policemen in Sopore area of Baramulla district in a daring attack on the police post guarding a local politician.Although the number of militants in north Kashmir has increased this summer following fresh infiltration from across the Line of Control (LoC), the ultras have suffered major setbacks during the past few weeks in Bandipora and Sopore areas, losing two of their top commanders.Ajmal Shah alias Abu Zarr, who was a self styled divisional commander of the LeT outfit, was killed in an encounter with security forces in Gaaroora area of Bandipora on July 19.On the very next day, security forces managed to eliminate Noman, who was involved in militancy for past six years and responsible for orchestrating the fidayeen attack at Lal Chowk earlier this year and several killings including that of a local militant commander Basharat Saleem in April.Although the militancy-related incidents in Kashmir valley have dropped this summer due to the ongoing agitation, security officials apprehend an upsurge in the militant attacks over the coming months.Meanwhile, Army recovered a cache of arms and ammunition from Sopore area in Baramulla district less than three days ahead of Independence Day celebrations.Troops of 29 Rashtriya Rifles and police recovered the cache of arms near Sangrama in Sopore area during a joint search operation.The recoveries included three AK rifles, five pistols with silencers, one Rocket Propelled Grenade launcher, two Under Barrel Grenade Launchers, 19 Improvised Explosive Devices, 30 Kgs of explosives, 11 grenades, two radio sets and a large quantity of stores.

Chidambaram in his May 11 letter.Swami Agnivesh had acted as a mediator between the Centre and the Maoists before Azad was killed by sleuths of the Andhra Pradesh State Intelligence Branch in Adilabad on July 2 in an encounter, which, the Maoists alleged, was fake.A credible judicial inquiry into Azad's death should be ordered by either the Centre or the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister to reflect the Centre's seriousness about the dialogue, said Swami Agnivesh.Swami Agnivesh said that once a judicial probe was ordered, he would ask the Maoists to announce a convenient date from which they would abjure violence for 72 hours so that the dialogue process could start.\"If not me, the Maoists could even contact writer Mahasweta Devi or social activist Debabrata Bandopadhyay and inform a specific date. They, however, should make it clear that the entire Communist Party of India (Maoist) is supporting the peace drive because the fact remains that the organisation has some dissident factions,\" Swami Agnivesh said.Immediately after receiving the truce offer, he contacted the Prime Minister's Office to seek an appointment for discussing the matter.

However, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has no plans at the moment to respond by canceling its visa-free privileges for Malaysian visitors, said Ger Bau shuan, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Taiwan has been granting visa-free treatment to Malaysian passport holders since 2002, while Malaysia has been offering landing visa privileges to Taiwan citizens since 2009. According to Ger, Malaysia's decision to stop issuing landing visas is part of its efforts to grapple with the increasingly serious problem of overstaying visitors from China, India and Bangladesh who have been abusing the system by working illegally in the country. Ger said Malaysia's decision applies to all countries around the world -- not just to Taiwan. He further said the Taiwan government has asked Malaysia no t to mistakenly put Taiwan on the list of countries whose citizens have been abusing the landing visa program. Ger said the MOFA will continue to hold talks with Malaysia to push for visa-free privileges for Taiwanese tourists. As a matter of fact, Ger said, few Malaysia bound Taiwanese visitors opt for landing visas because it is cheaper to obtain a Malaysian visa in Taiwan. Taiwanese citizens make more than 200,000 visits to Malaysia annually, Ger said.

Based on disposable income, the middle class steadily declined from 68.5 percent of households in 1996 before the Asia n financial crisis to 61.9 percent in 2000, 58.5 percent in 2006, and 56.7 percent last year. By contrast, the rate for the upper class rose from 20.2 percent in 1996 to 24.1 percent last year, and that of the poor also increased from 11.3 percent to 19.2 percent over the same period. Samsung Economic Research Institute also said the share of middle-income households dropped from 60.4 percent in 2003 to 55.5 percent last year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development defines the middle class as households that earn between 50 and 150 percent of a country's median income. The results of the two Korean think tanks based on the OECD's definition show that with a steep decline in the number of the middle class, middle-class people who became poor outnumbered those who joined the upper class. The collapse of the middle class has also plagued advanced economies such as the U.S., Japan and those in Europe. Japan, which had been considered a country wh ose population belonged to the middle-class, is now called a \"wealth gap society\" or \"lower-class society\" after a decade of economic stagnation in the 1990s. The U.S. and Europe also saw their middle-class populations decline as jobs in services and manufacturing migrated to China and India. Korea's middle class, however, has shrunk faster than any other country over the past decade after having posted steady growth since the 1960s. The middle class is the key to social stability. A burgeoning middle class helps social integration. By contrast, the rising number of middle-class people falling into poverty could ignite class conflict and social unrest and cause politicians to resort to populist policies. The fundamental and long-term solution to boost the middle class is economic growth. To this end, the government should simultaneously pursue the existing model of export-oriented growth along with raising domestic consumption. Another urgent task is to implement economic reform to nurture talent that can adapt to changing economic and industrial environments. Korea's average wage has almost reached the level of advanced economies. To increase the number of middle-class households, the creation of high value-added jobs is necessary. The shortest way to add quality jobs is deregulation in high-end service sectors such as medical care, education, law and tourism and removal of entry barriers in such sectors. Large corporations that raised sufficient funds through exports should be allowed to enter high value-added services and green growth industries. Blasting this as preferential treatment for such large corporations is an outdated perception. In his farewell ceremony, outgoing Prime Minister Chung Un-chan (Cho'ng Un-ch'an) said, \"Both a government that doesn't do what it must do and a government that believes it can do everything hurt the interests of the nation and people.\" What the Lee Myung- bak government must do is to restore the middle class and should shift its policy focus to achieve this task.

Her visa is valid till August 16 and has been extended by another year, official sourc es said.Her application for granting a permanent residency in the country has been hanging in balance for years together.Earlier, the Indian government had said that Taslima's visa cannot be extended beyond August 16, 2010, as her travel document had been issued under the category (miscellaneous).Taslima, a Swedish passport-holder, had sought visa under the miscellaneous category in 2005 and it has since been extended initially for a year and later for six months. The visa under this category cannot be extended beyond five years. She had been conveyed that she should seek fresh visa from a third country after which she could visit India again, the sources said.However, the writer community of the country and intellectuals from other parts of the world had made an appeal to the government for considering her case as a special one and extend her visa.Taslima, who has been in and out of the country after she was dramatically bundled out of the eastern Indian state of West Benga l in November 2007 in the wake of protests by radical Muslim groups, came from London in July and was immediately whisked away to a safe location.The writer, who shot to fame with her controversial book 'Lajja' in 1994, has been told that she could stay in some other country for a few days and later apply afresh for the visa under the same category, pending her request for a permanent residency in the country, the sources said.Taslima had earlier expressed her desire to visit Kolkata city but it was turned down on the ground that radical elements may try to harm her, the sources said.Taslima had earlier left India on March 18, 2008, for Sweden after she was kept at an undisclosed place here for more than four months. She had not been allowed to see any visitor during the period and described her confinement as \"a chamber of death\".Recipient of various awards, she was shifted from her Kolkata residence after violent protests in the eastern metropolis against her con troversial book \"Dwikhondito\" (divided into two). Certain references in the book had earned the wrath of some Muslim organisations which demanded that she be asked to leave the Left-ruled state.Taslima has lived in exile in many countries, including France, Sweden, the US and India, since leaving her home in Dhaka in a cloak of secrecy in 1994. During her stay in India in the last five years, she has periodically travelled abroad with the last trip being in August 2009.(Description of Source: New Delhi PTI News Agency in English ) Material in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the source cited.

In such a situation, the fence would have run through the town.However, Dhaka's concurrence is another instance of the new-found cosiness between the two nations since Sheikh Hasina's return to power.Assam Accord implementation minister Bhumidhar Barman told The Telegraph of the development while dwelling on the hurdles that are delaying the fencing of the border even 25 years after the Assam Accord was signed and the steps Dispur is taking to expedite the process.Sealing of the border is one of the important clauses of the tripartite pact signed by the Centre, Dispur and the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) in 1985.\"It is a major breakthrough in bilateral relations from Assam's point of view. It will help speed up the fencing work. We have been moving the Centre to get the dispute resolved for the past several years. We have now received permission to erect the fence within 150 yards of the international boundary in Karimganj town. Land is now being acquired for the fencing work to start very soon. We hope the other disputed stretch of 2.874km in the Latitila-Dumabari area of the district is also resolved at the earliest,\" Barman said.Sources said giving relief to a population of about 25,000 living along the border weighed heavily on the minds of Indian and Bangladeshi authorities when they agreed to a relaxation of the fencing norms.\"It shows a spirit of accommodation a nd flexibility on part of Dhaka. Karimganj was a sticky point between the two countries. The process to get the issue resolved gathered momentum after the 2005 tripartite meeting on the Assam Accord chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The ministry of home affairs and external affairs actively pursued the matter with Dhaka, which also wants a favourable response to areas in adverse possession of India,\" the source said.Karimganj deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu said a survey of the stretch was under way and would be completed by August for the National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) Ltd to erect the fence along the bank of the river.\"The fencing will help prevent cross-border influx and antisocial activities. It is a very positive development,\" he added.Echoing Angamuthu, a senior BSF official said a flag meeting was held recently with the Bangladesh Rifles to ensure that the fencing work proceeded smoothly. \"The decision was taken at the h ighest level between the two countries,\" he added.Assam shares a boundary of 267.330km with Bangladesh, of which 132km runs along Karimganj district.From 2006 onwards, central agencies have been assigned the work of constructing roads and fences and repairing fences that were completed in the first phase. The NBCC, National Projects Construction Corporation Ltd and the state PWD are in charge of erecting the fence.The residents hailed the development. Habibur Rahaman, a newspaper editor, said thousands of people would get a much-needed relief now that the issue had been resolved amicably.BJP legislator Mission Ranjan Das said the decision would spare thousands of dwellers of Karimganj town from living in a no-man's land as would have been the situation if the 150-yard norm had been maintained.

Mr. Chandra described the ties between Belarus and India as traditionally \"warm and cordial\" and emphasized the similarity of the two countries- views on regional and international issues and the importance of visits by high-ranking government officials and inter-parliamentary cooperation. Bilateral trade and economic cooperation is becoming more active, with Indian-Belarusian trade exceeding $600 million in 2009, Mr. Chandra said. The modernization of a power plant in Hrodna is one of the most important joint projects, estimated at $55 million, he said. An Indian delegation has recently arrived in Belarus to visit the plant, he noted. Other notable projects include the establishment of a training center for Belarusians at the High-Tech Park in Minsk, he said. A delegation of Indian businesspeople interested in buying and selling machine-building products will visit Belarus in October, Mr. Chandra said. In the fourth quarter of the year, a delegation of the state of Punjab will visit Belarus to discuss ways of developing cooperation in the agricultural sector and the farm produce processing industry, he said. Indian-Belarusian cooperation in the field of culture and education is excellent, Mr. Chandra said. About 100 citizens of India currently study at higher educational institutions in Belarus and about 500 Belarusians practice Indian dance styles in Minsk alone, he noted. In addition, he said, young Belarusian women visit Mumbai to perform in musicals and be cheerleaders at cricket games. Mr. Chandra called on Belarus to develop commercial tourism and noted that the facilities of Belarusfilm could be used to shoot both Bollywood movies and joint movies. The ambassador stressed that he was open for cooperation and urged journalists to help Belarusians learn more about India.

However, Taiwan's Minis try of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has no plans at the moment to respond by canceling its visa-free privileges for Malaysian visitors, said Ger Bau-shuan, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.Taiwan has been granting visa-free treatment to Malaysian passport holders since 2002, while Malaysia has been offering landing visa privileges to Taiwan citizens since 2009.According to Ger, Malaysia's decision to stop issuing landing visas is part of its efforts to grapple with the increasingly serious problem of overstaying visitors from China, India and Bangladesh who have been abusing the system by working illegally in the country.Ger said Malaysia's decision applies to all countries around the world -- not just to Taiwan.He further said the Taiwan government has asked Malaysia not to mistakenly put Taiwan on the list of countries whose citizens have been abusing the landing visa program.Ger said the MOFA will continue to hold talks with Malaysi a to push for visa-free privileges for Taiwanese tourists.As a matter of fact, Ger said, few Malaysia-bound Taiwanese visitors opt for landing visas because it is cheaper to obtain a Malaysian visa in Taiwan.Taiwanese citizens make more than 200,000 visits to Malaysia annually, Ger said.(Description of Source: Taipei Central News Agency in English -- \"Central News Agency (CNA),\" Taiwan's major state-run press agency; generally favors ruling administration in its coverage of domestic and international affairs; URL: http://www.cna.com.tw) Material in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the source cited.

Twenty-seven CRPF and state police troopers were killed in the encoun ter. The report has been forwarded to the Union home ministry.The casualties in the Dhaurai encounter were finally evacuated in a civilian helicopter chartered by Chhattisgarh police.The latest round in the bickering started in the thick of action last week. In blinding rain on Wednesday, a state police officer who had lost touch with base in the middle of a firefight climbed a hillock near Kirandul, about 30km from Dantewada, and over a weak signal radioed his superiors for reinforcements.More than two companies of security forces comprising Chhattisgarh police's Special Task Force and special police officers called the Koya commandos were on a mission to hit a Maoist hideout near the National Mineral Development Corporation's facilities.\"We asked for the CRPF Cobras (the special action teams of the Central Reserve Police Force) but they refused and said they will come only if Indian Air Force helicopters were ready to take them,\" a senior Chhattisgarh police offi cer said.The officer admitted that the state administration was panicky because 25 policemen who had returned to base had reported that another 75 troopers of their party, tasked to carry out a multi-directional assault on a hill, were missing. The forces were led by the deputy inspector-general, Dantewada, S.R.P. Kalluri. The two columns had lost radio contact in the rain.A senior CRPF officer said: \"We had readied two teams of Cobras at Polampalli (in Dantewada district) and in Jagdalpur (in Bastar) but the Indian Air Force refused to fly.\"The air force has four helicopters assigned for the counter-Naxalite operations in Bastar -- two Mi-17s, each capable of carrying more than 20 fully-equipped troops, and two Dhruv advanced light helicopters. But in a peculiar arrangement, the helicopters have been placed at the disposal of the central forces for 80 hours of flying time for all four choppers in a month.This means each helicopter can fly only 20 hours in a month -- or that each is permitted to fly sorties that last less than an hour a day.Contrary to reports from air headquarters in New Delhi, too, the IAF helicopters on counter-Maoist deployment are neither armed nor armoured. Officially, each of the helicopters has been assigned two Garud (IAF special forces) personnel. But often they cannot be taken on board to make space for either casualties, VIPs or security personnel of the central paramilitary forces.The security establishment also concluded that if the helicopters are armoured (armour-plated at the bottom) to withstand small-arms fire, they cannot carry enough personnel. Armour-plating increases the weight of the machine and makes it less manoeuvrable.The IAF doubts that the state and central forces in Chhattisgarh have sanitised helipads to ensure that they are beyond the range of small- arms firing by the Maoists.These reasons are unacceptable to the police who complain that the \"air warriors\" lead a life of rel ative luxury.\"Do you know, that unlike my men who live in the jungles battling not only Maoists but also a shortage of supplies and malaria, the IAF personnel get to live in air-conditioned quarters?\" an incredulous CRPF officer complained.An IAF officer in New Delhi cited two reasons for limiting th e flying hours. First, the IAF views its counter-Maoist deployment as a secondary task, its primary one being on the borders and in states where the military is involved in counter-insurgency (in Jammu and Kashmir and in the Northeast) and where the Armed Forces Special Powers Act is in force.For high-altitude border duties -- such as in Siachen (and currently to give relief in Leh) -- the helicopters have to be kept at maximum serviceability. The officer said the copters have to be \"rotated\", meaning that the same machine cannot be kept flying for multiple sorties.The IAF's helicopter fleet is less than fully operational. A report by the Comptroller and Audi tor General last week found that the force was able to meet only 74 per cent of its operational requirement.The fleet is ageing and about 78 per cent of the helicopters were being flown beyond their prescribed life. Between 2002 and 2007, the force has not inducted a single helicopter.The upshot was that \"serviceability\" (availability for sorties) was low and fluctuated between 45 per cent and 75 per cent.The IAF is currently recalling its helicopters on UN missions in Africa to bridge the gap.In Chhattisgarh and in the counter-Maoist operations that gap is translating into bodybags.

The US government hikes visa fees for Indian companies which employ more than 50% of H1B and L1 visa holders. President Barack Obama asserts that his policies will ensure American jobs do not any more go to China, India or Germany. Do these smoke signals a dd up to a serious crisis point for Indo-US relations?Probably not. These straws should be seen as nothing more than a political game which has marginal economic significance for the two countries. Indo-US business relations are nowhere near the brink, and they do not spell doom for either side immediately or in the future.It has been customary in India to read a little too much into every American posture in the business arena, but the time has come to treat American politicians in the same way that we do our ours -- with amusement, if not disdain. It is not surprising that American politicians make the usual loud and ineffective noises about saving American jobs. They are actually trying to save their own jobs.Schumer should have realised that chop shops do not hurt big economies like that of the US and the trouble lies elsewhere. He need not have looked beyond Detroit and the auto majors to understand the real problems of lagging American competitiveness.Similarly, the ri se is visa fees is more in the nature of a punitive measure because it will not help in creating the skilled workforce that America needs. If anything, it will only accelerate outsourcing instead of keeping those jobs in America. President Obama was indeed careful to emphasise that his policies were directed towards education and innovation which will strengthen the American economy instead of imposing direct protectionist measures.Whatever the rhetoric of globalisation, countries are playing the old game of everyone for himself. This is not likely to change. All that we can demand is that the game is played according to the rules, and losers should not cry foul every time things are not going their way.

Ahluwalia (BJP) (Bharatiya Janata Party) said during Zero Hour.Demanding a response from the government, he said some foreign tourists after returning from India reported some infection and attributed it to Indian hospitals. \"It may not be true,\" he said.Ahluwalia, who was supported by Jayanthi Natarajan (Cong) (Indian National Congress), said there should be a system of maintaining a registry for patients suffering from infectious diseases.Natarajan said reports of superbug, attributable to India, is a \"wrong propaganda against the country\".Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Prithviraj Chavan said he would find out the facts from the health minister.According to a study publish ed in \"The Lancet Infectious Diseases\", a hospital-acquired superbug which cannot be treated by the existing drugs is originating from India.Indian medical tourism industry which is making rapid progress revolves around providing treatment and surgeries to global patients at significantly lower costs. The sector has been estimated at 1200 crore (one crore equals 10m) rupees.In a separate Zero Hour mention, Avinash Rai Khanna (BJP) expressed concern over the water level in the Bhakra Dam reaching towards the danger mark. He said Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana (northern states) and Rajasthan (western state) face the threat of floods.P.

Mysura Reddy (TDP) (Telegu Desam Party) expressed concern over spread of swine flu in Andhra Pradesh (southern state).Naresh Gujral (SAD) (Shiromani Akali Dal) demanded that the government should take up with Pakistan the problem of Sutlej river getting polluted from across the border.He said people in the Malwa region of Punjab are suffering from various diseases as lethal chemicals find their way into the river.(Description of Source: New Delhi PTI News Agency in English ) Material in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the source cited.

Shahidul Islam: War Crime Trial Dogged by Conflict of Laws \\- Holiday Online Thursday August 12, 2010 06:20:54 GMT Contrary to sweeping assertion that the government of Bangladesh lacks judicial mandate to embark upon the 1971 war crime trial, the lack of authority is not what undercuts the validation of such a trial. Rather, conflict of laws is what seems to be making the venture questionable, (and) controversial. Besides, the arrest of some suspects of the crime long before the framing of the charge has created a procedural breach under the 1973 International Crime Tribunal Act (ICT) itself. And, the Law Minister's recent assertion that the US and the UK have no business to poke their noses in the trial proceedings made things further worse. The Law Minister seems to be trying to make a scramble without breaking the egg. Whether one calls it war crime or crime against humanity, any trial relating to such crimes derives its authority from the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (GA Res. 260A, 1948), which reco gnized the principles and the judgments of the Nuremberg trail and made it an integral part of customary international law. The Convention also mandated that a competent tribunal of the state where the crimes took place could hold the trial, although most of the trials so far had taken place under an international panel tribunal to ensure neutrality and fairness. Despite the concerned UN Convention having proven controversial from the outset -- for its presupposition about the existence of an international government to try international crimes by an international panel -- the concurrent empowerment of concerned municipal government's aimed at overcoming that drawback. And due to such crimes involving trans-national parties, the Security Council (UNSC) removed the veil of ambiguity by creating an international tribunal on February 22, 1993 to conduct trial of genocide in former Yugoslavia. A similarly constituted court tried the Rwanda war crime trial in 1994 and issued in dictments. Conflict of laws The conflict of laws arises from the jurisdiction, mandate, applicable/conflicting laws, etc. Besides, procedural and legal fairness remains a central concern in such trials. For instance, death penalty may be an acceptable norm under the domestic law of some nations, including ours, but it is not permissible in many other countries or in the international crime tribunal. Secondly, although confessions taken under torture and other coercive means are not recognized as admissible evidence under the domestic and international laws, we have an exception in this regard too, albeit theoretically. Finally, absence of all the parties involved in the 'chain of the crime,' especially when the trial occurs under the municipal law of a particular nation may invalidate the legality of the entire trial proceedings by challenging its authority and fairness. In our instance, deprivation of right to appeal/judicial review, as was stipulated in the latest amendment to the International Crime Tribunal (ICT) Act of 1973, is blatantly contradictory to the equal rights afforded to every citizen in Article 27 of Bangladesh Constitution. This fundamental right can only be waived if the accused are not citizens of Bangladesh, which they are. Murky backdrop There is little doubt that the instances of war crime, genocide and other crimes against humanity were rampant and ubiquitous during Bangladesh war of liberation in 1971. Yet, our government failed to impress upon the UN to convene a special committee to legally authenticate the crimes' commission. Instead, the government of Sheikh Mujib promulgated Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order on January 24, 1972 for trial of 'domestic collaborators'. The crimes having originated from the order and command of people who ceased to be part of our nation as of the Proclamation of Independence Order in April 1971, the collaboration order turned into a weapon of prosecution against selective Bengali 'subordinates' of the Pakistani armed forces who had planned and directed the crimes' perpetration. This fundamental flaw was further compounded due to other legal inhibitions, compelling the Mujib regime to enact the First Amendment Act to the Constitution on 15 July 1973. The Act amended Article 47 of the Constitution by inserting an additional clause which allowed prosecution and punishment of any person accused of 'genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes and other crimes under international law'. That too failed to remove the legal inhibitions in their totality, due to the insertion of Article 47A which rendered inapplicable for the accused certain fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution. That has resulted in the passing of the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act (ICT) on July 20, 1973. International agreements The ICT did relate such crimes as being the staples of international law, as they are suppo sed to be. The main obstacle proved to be the fate of some 30,000 captive Bengali soldiers (ranging from sepoy to three star generals) and non-combatants who awaited repatriation from Pakistan while Islamabad had serious concerns about the fate of some 90, 000 of its soldiers who had surrendered, pursuant to the Geneva Convention, to the Indian army on December 16 and awaited repatriation to Pakistan. Pakistan argued that it had followed armistice on December 16 under international laws of war, and, the absence of any certification by a competent UN-sponsored commission that the alleged war crimes constituted genocide had immune its forces from undergoing such a trial under the municipal law of Bangladesh. Tripartite agreement 1973 Pakistan also managed to convince India, within weeks, to sign (on August 28, 1973) a tripartite agreement in which India signed on behalf of Bangladesh. The agreement stated in clause V1 that \"Bangladesh agrees that no trials of t he prisoners of war shall take place during the entire period of repatriation and that pending the settlement envisaged in clause (V11) below these prisoners of war shall remain in India.\" Meanwhile, in order to obtain formal recognition from Pakistan and other Muslim countries -- as well as in deference to the tripartite agreement of 1973 - the government of Bangladesh declared a general amnesty on November 30, 1973 for those collaborators 'not yet charged with specific allegations of war-related atrocities'. The Press Note on general amnesty categorically said, \"Those who were punished for or are accused of rape, murder, attempts to murder or arson will not come under general amnesty.\" This resulted in the release from prison of some 26,000 detainees, out of 37,000 suspected collaborators who were apprehended and processed for trial in the aftermath of the war. Minister's arrogance The political changeover of 1975 having restored judicial fairne ss in the amended Constitution, about 11,000 suspected collaborators took recourse to appeal reviews and got released. The Collaboration Order itself was repealed on December 31, 1975 and the file closed, in order to move ahead with a renewed spirit of national reconciliation. Despite that being the backdrop, our Law Minister managed to antagonize two of the friendly international partners of development - USA and UK - by stating lately that they had no business of poking noses in the war crime trial. The comment displayed a bad mix of ignorance and arrogance, and defied the very rationale of the trial due to the crimes involving resolution and 'closed transactions' reached through international agreements, armistice and repatriation-related conditionali ty signed after the conclusion of the 1971 war, as well as the affordability and the accessibility of the accused to a varied mix of fundamental rights outlined in the relevant International Human Rights Charters of which Bangladesh is a signatory. UN, relevant bodies The UN and other relevant international governments and organizations thus have a moral compulsion to ensure that the trial is procedurally and legally fair and the rights of the accused are respected to the fullest extent. That is precisely why the government requested the UN in September 2009 to dispatch a team to Dhaka to advice on the technicalities of the war criminals trial. The USA and the UK are permanent members of the UN Security Council. The Law Minister's assertion also stands in stark contrast with the amendments brought to the 1973 ICT on July 9, 2009, whereupon the accepted definition of 'armed forces' now means the forces raised and maintained under the Pakistan Army Act 1952, the Air Force Act 1953 and the Navy Ordinance of 1961. That effort too aimed at ensuring the legal and the procedural fairness of the trial itself. More amendment needed Instead of showing arrogance, the government m ust reconsider to amend the 1973 ICT further due to the latest amendment having inserted a very objectionable clause that allows trial of individuals for war crimes 'even if they are not member of an 'auxiliary force' created under the Pakistan Armed Forces Act(s)' cited above. This particular clause does not obey the rules with the stipulations of the 1949 Geneva Convention and many other Protocols in which the stature of a person in the hierarchy of command is viewed as being determinative of whether that person has had command responsibility, or, the blame should be attributed to the civilian masters of the military and/or other auxiliary forces under their command. Historically, every war crime trial dealt with two questions in particular: whether (1) compliance of order from superior officers serves as a defence for the accused, and, (2) how far the command responsibility traverses up the chain of command? When things are so complicated, our government should strive to ensure that the conflict of laws are addressed, international agreements are complied with, and concerned international organizations and the governments are allowed to play a decisive role in ensuring the legal and procedural fairness of the trial.

Therefore, whatever decisions may be made in this meeting, they will have no authenticity; nor can the situation in Kashmir be improved through these decisions. If Manmohan Singh is desirous of improving the situation in Kashmir, he should march toward a permanent solution, instead of patching up the situation, something that will allow the implementation of UN r esolutions. It is quite obvious that all the efforts made by the Indian interior minister to stop the protest have failed; and now the Indian prime minister is attempting to put out the fire sparked by the violent acts of the Indian security forces in occupied (Indian-administered) Kashmir. This attempt will not succeed, because it is not a concrete solution to the problem.\" Islam Argues Kashmiris Deserve Full Support of Islamic World The Islam daily comments in its editorial: \"The reports received from occupied Kashmir tell new stories about the Kashmiris' passion for freedom. The Indian occupying forces have imposed a curfew in the valley for many days in order to overcome the struggle of the lovers of freedom. However, as soon as the curfew is relaxed, Kashmiri youths, children, old people, and women come out onto the roads in protest against the Indian atrocities. Mir Waiz Umar Farooq, chairman of the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, has said that tal ks will not be held with India on anything less than the right to self-determination. The Kashmiri people and leaders not only deserve appreciation for waging a freedom struggle against the Indian imperialists for 30 consecutive years, but they also deserve the full support of the Islamic world.\" The daily further writes: \"The need of the hour is that Pakistan should highlight the issue of Kashmiris' right to self-determination at the international level and efforts should be made to gain the full support of the Islamic world in this regard. In addition to the government, the Pakistani media also should prominently present the Kashmiris' freedom struggle. Along with this, Indian atrocities and secret activities, which are based on conspiracies and aggressive designs, should also be unveiled.\" Ummat Argues Peoples of Both Countries Desire Durable Peace Between Pakistan, India The Ummat daily comments in its editorial: \"The peoples of both countries desire durable peace between Pakistan and India. The Indian foreign secretary believes that it is difficult to find a way for that. This is an expression of Indian insincerity. Otherwise, the atmosphere of solidarity and harmony between Pakistan and India can be created by accepting the reality of Pakistan from the core of the heart and by resolving the Kashmir issue in accordance with the UN resolutions and the established international principles of justice. As a result, both countries can rid their people of poverty, hunger, ignorance, and disease and set them on the road to prosperity. They have so many natural resources that they can leave several major developed countries behind through mutual cooperation. Extremist Indian leaders have kept themselves and their people under the delusion for the last six decades that, through the passage of time and with the cooperation of international forces, Pakistan will be weakened so much that it will be forced to surrender to Indian hegemony.\" The daily further writes: \"The United States, the United Kingdom, and India all are adamant on the point that Pakistan should not promote terrorism; meanwhile, India, itself is involved in the worst form of state terrorism in occupied Kashmir. The entire world knows that Pakistan is the greatest victim of terrorism and it is making efforts beyond its power to wipe out this curse. Then, why does not the international community, including India, not extend full and conclusive cooperation to Pakistan, instead of leveling accusations?\" Jasarat Article Condemns Zardari Over UK Tour In his article entitled \"When Will People Pick Up Shoe?\" Muzaffar Ejaz comments: \"See, the television channels have once again been blocked. The psychology of all those engaged in the struggle for freedom of expression, champions of democracy, military dictators, and political and non-political leaders is the same: as long as the freedom of expression is against others, it is freedom of expression; as soon as the freedom of expression turns toward oneself, it becomes overstepping the limits and conspiracy and politics in the name of the flood and so on. Earlier, it was said: 'Do not throw stones at us; we are not wearing bangles.' Now, it is said the politicians should know that the jialas (Pakistan People's Party workers) also wear shoes. A whole debate is taking place as to whether this incident did or did not take place. Since there is no coordination in the government ranks and everyone has got his wires crossed, everyone has become a self-appointed spokesperson of the party or the person. Farhatullah Babar states: 'I do not know of any such incident, even though I was sitting very close (to President Zardari).' Fauzia Wahab is the spokesperson of heaven knows who. She said the information minister has not confirmed that a shoe was hurled at the president. However, along with her, La w Minister Babar Awan has reported that those who engage in shoe politics should know that jialas also wear shoes. In other words, the shoe was indeed hurled; whether or not it hit is not known. However, just as Bush shamelessly said that neither of the shoes hit, the president's spokesperson is saying that it did not hit; indeed, it was not hurled at all. Therefore, in this context, Fauzia Wahab is right in saying that the information minister has not confirmed it. The information minister himself has said the best thing. He said that the Pakistanis living in the United Kingdom have appreciated the president's tour. He did not explain that.\" Ejaz continues: \"However, the television channels that have been closed down and that have not been closed did show the appreciation of the president's visit: the Pakistanis were appreciating him outside the hall during the president's add ress in Birmingham. On the other hand, Shamim Khan, who was sitting inside the hall, took off his shoes from his feet in profuse appreciation. That is what is done in respect; shoes are taken off. Since Shamim Khan was overpowered by emotions, he took off shoes and tossed them at the president in protest. What is the fault of the television channels about this? Bush's shoe was made a game. However, when a shoe was hurled at our own president because of his mistake, why have the television channels been closed down?\" Material in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the source cited.

The acute problems faced by the fishermen include the reduction of subsidies by the government, the need for them to get more foreign workers and their frequent arrest by the Indonesian Navy when they go out to fish in the international waters. The issue relating to the fishermen's conflict with the Indonesian navy is an issue that has remain unresolved for t he past 20 years. Since the Malaysian Navy base is located at Lumut, Perak, we do not see why the Malaysian Navy cannot take proactive action to protect the fishermen in Perak.

However, because of rebound from the cigarette retailers, on Tuesday10 August night, the National Tobacco Board quickly called a press meeting to allow the cigarette traders to apply for license before 31 December. To make furthe r confusion to the business community, the relevant authority again came out with a more recent statement to clarify that the new Tobacco Licensing Rule does not exist now. This is not the first time the government came out with some rule hastily, and then retracted it because of adverse criticism coming from people. Although it is good for the government to listen to public opinion, it remains crucial for the relevant authority to do their home work before implementing new regulation in the morning but retracting it overnight.

However, the CRPF men had been posted to \"maintain law and order\" and did not have any \"clue about how the duo looked like\", po lice sources said.While Manoj left the procession and disappeared into the forest just 2km from the rally site, Asit hovered near the BDO's office in Lalgarh bazaar, half a kilometre from the venue, for about an hour before slipping away. Along the way, they spoke to the media and even allowed themselves to be photographed. While committee secretary Manoj is wanted for murder and arson, Asit is an accused in the Jnaneswari Express sabotage case.Police officers admitted that the CRPF personnel posted along the Jhitka forest could have arrested the duo had there been someone to identify them. \"We had to concentrate on the ground where Mamata was holding her meeting and could not place intelligence officials or local policemen on all the roads leading to Lalgargh,\" an officer said.Director-general of police Bhupinder Singh had said that wanted committee leaders would be arrested if they were seen at Mamata's rally. At Writers' Buildings yesterday, Singh said: \"We re these two people (the Mahato duo) near the dais or the stage? What can we do if somebody is seen in a village? We can't deploy our men there.\"A West Midnapore official said: \"The audacity with which the two wanted PCPA leaders roamed about openly near the rally ground should embarrass the cops. They almost dared the police to arrest them.\"An officer said the police had tracked the whereabouts of Manoj and Asit by monitoring their cellphone calls on the day of the rally. But nothing was done thereafter as everyone was too busy with Mamata's visit.\"Our first priority was to ensure the safety and security of Mamata Banerjee,\" an officer said. \"Arresting Manoj and Asit was not something we were overly concerned with.\"Police officers admitted in private that they had no intention of \"going on an arresting spree\" before the rally as it could have caused law-and-order problems with so many committee supporters around.Manoj Verma, the West Midnapore superintendent of police, said: \"Since Manoj Mahato had announced that he would be present at the meeting, arrangements were made at the venue to initiate lawful action against him. It is difficult to spot an accused if he melts into hundreds of supporters.\" (Description of Source: Kolkata The Telegraph online in English -- Website of Kolkata's highest circulation English daily, owned by ABP Group, with a flagship publication Anandabazar Patrika in Bengali.

At the moment, Barack Obama appears to have nothing but the mid-term elections in mind. It is crucial for the president of the United States of America to lead his party to a respectable victory in the polls. But he must tread the populist path with caution. True, the measure to raise visa fees for skilled workers, passed by the Senate, will please many in the US if it eventually becomes law. Two years ago, Americans had chosen Mr Obama as their president, expecting him to save them not only from George W. Bush but also from an economic downturn as bad as the Great Depression of the 1930s. For Mr Obama, in spite of all his rhetoric of fairness, one major way of creating employment is by reducing the number of foreign nationals working in the US. With the steep hike in visa fees, he has finally set out to clear more space for domestic workers.Obviously, Mr Obama's policy would be damaging for Indian information-technology companies that are major players in the US market. These firms temporarily place a section of their employees in the US to offer on-shore services. In the process, they pay nearly $1 billion in social security for their workers. An additional cost of $200-250 million, which is what the increment will entail if it comes into effect, will discourage Indian companies to continue operating out of the US. And ironically, it is the US that will suffer the greater loss. Not only will it have to relinquish access to cheap labour supplied by the Indian IT sector, but also forsake a huge amount that is paid to it as social security, which Indian workers never stay back to reap the benefits of. I ndian firms, though facing a bad deal, may carry on business in the same way, given the advantages of this age of super-connectivity -- Skype and video-conferencing could replace on-site services. What is worse is the evident discriminatory tilt in Mr Obama's plan. The revised visa rates apply only to companies with less than 50 per cent US workforce. So a US firm meeting the stipulation will be able to bring workers from India at half the cost while Indian companies bear the brunt of the new regulations. A biased policy such as this was least expected of a man who had been globally hailed as a messiah of equality. At any rate, trade cannot flourish, especially in this age of free market, if restrictions on the free movement of labour are not lifted.

Although the Trinamool has described the rally as ' apolitical' in which participants included activists and ordinary villagers, the role of the People's Committee against Police Atrocities (PCPA) in organising it is hard to ignore. Senior PCPA leaders were seen in the vicinity of the rally.Many in the audience were said to be PCPA activists. Reports from the rally venue say that for all practical purposes this was a joint Trinamool-PCPA rally. The PCPA is believed to be behind the derailment of the Jnaneswari Express that resulted in a train collision that left over 150 people dead. It is widely regarded as a Maoist front organisation. Mamata is a cabinet minister and her party is a constituent of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government which has banned the Maoists and is currently engaged in operations against them and their front organisations. Her participation in the PCAPA rally was therefore irresponsible.Some of the comments that Mamata made in her speech are quite at variance with the position of the governme nt she is a part of. She has called for a halt to security operations in the Jangalmahal area. She also described the recent killing of Maoist spokesperson Cherukuri Rajkumar alias Azad as a murder. Differences between constituents of a coalition government are understandable but the charges she is levelling are serious. If she does harbour such serious policy differences with the UPA, she should step down. Else, she is guilty of running with the hare, even as she hunts with the hound. Her departure from the NDA stemmed from her opposing stance on various policy issues.It has been apparent for some time now that Mamata is propping up the Maoists. She is determined to defeat the ruling Left Front in West Bengal and is drawing on Maoist support for the upcoming electoral battle. Mamata is playing a dangerous game. The massive crowd the PCPA was able to rustle up for her rally might have impressed voters.But PCPA/Maoist backing will not be without a price. Is she considering me eting their demands if elected to power? Her short-sighted approach of using the Maoists in her fight against the Left may well boomerang on her. It is time the UPA broke its enigmatic silence and demanded more responsible behaviour from her.

If they are not neutralised the situation would go out of control, said director-general of police R.R. Girish Kumar.Mr Kumar told his counterparts on Wednesday at the Southern DGPs conference that there is a dire need to take preventive steps to curb the spread of the movement in the south. \"The front organisations of Maoists and their mass-based organisations are active in urban areas of southern states,\" observed Mr Girish. \"While Andhra could contain left wing extremist movement to a great extent, the fact that the movement has spread to nearly 160 districts across the country is an indication of growing militancy,\" the DGP said. He said the inter-state operations by Andhra Pradesh and Karantaka recently averted a major threat to the life of politicians an d police officials by the Maoist action teams. Mr Kumar said, \"The problem of left-wing extremism in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is not as serious as it is in Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Jharkhand. But there are secret cells and frontal organisations operating in these southern states.\" It was decided in the meeting that heads of intelligence agencies of four states handling left-wing extremism should meet once in six months for exchange information and also real time information has to be gathered from time to time. The information on rehabilitation of surrendered extremists, compensation to the naxal victims, rewards shall be shared with states' nodal officers.The DGPs also agreed upon sharing of photographs and details of Left-wing extremists, terrorists and other organised criminals on day-to-day basis.The one-day conference at Jubilee Hall was attended by Kerala DGP Jacob Punnoose, CID DGP of Karnataka D.V.

Krishna said Thursday (12 August).Replying to supplementaries (supplementary questions) during Question Hour in Rajya Sabha (upper house of Indian parliament), Krishna said there was uninterrupted dialogue from 2004 till the Mumbai terrorist attack. \"The attack in Mumbai was a point where we had to discontinue the composite dialogue,\" he said.\"India will be willing to hold sustained dialogue with Pakistan\" if the Islamic nation was to guarantee that its \"soil is not going to be directed for terrorist attacks (against India) and foment anti-India feelings,\" he said.\"The biggest confidence-building measure that Pakistan can do is to prevent any future terrorist attack (on India) and prevent speeches made by jihadi forces,\" Krishna said.\"We would like to have friendly, cordial and cooperative relations with Pakistan,\" he said.The prime ministers of the two countries had in Thimpu identified trust def icit as the impeding factor which needed to be bridged.Meeting of foreign secretaries and foreign ministers of the two countries was decided as one of the steps to lessen trust deficit.\"Our effort has been to fulfil that mandate given to us by the prime minister,\" he said.Krishna said India considers Hafiz Sayeed, leader of Jamaat-ud-Dawaa (JUD) - a Pakistani organization having links with Lashkar-i-Toiba, as the mastermind of the Mumbai attack.\"Unfortunately, Pakistan becomes subjective whenever we bring Hafiz Sayeed and others in discussion,\" he said. \"We certainly would like Pakistan to be helpful and cooperative with India so we can live in peace with each other.\"\"The fulfilment, in letter and spirit, of the solemn commitment given by the leaders of Pakistan, at the highest level, of not allowing territory under Pakistan's control to be used for any terrorist activity directed against India, would be the biggest confidence-building meas ure,\" he said.Krishna said he had in his talks with foreign minister of Pakistan on 15 July stated that any further terrorist attack on India emanating from Pakistani soil would cause immense harm to the normalization process.He called for \"credible and firm action against terrorist groups and their leaders, like the JUD and Hafiz Sayeed, who continue to incite violence against India.\"Krishna said he conveyed India's willingness to have further interaction on pressing humanitarian issues \"as part of a step-by-step, graduated and forward-looking approach to expanding dialogue to cover all issues of mutual interest and concern.\"There are 582 Indian fishermen in Pakistani jails and, likewise, there are 412 Pakistani fishermen in Indian jails, he said, adding, New Delhi wants to hold dialogue on early release and repatriation of prisoners and fishermen in jails in both countries, promotion of trade and commerce and greater people-to-people contact.During the 15 July dialogue in Islamabad, the foreign minister of Pakistan assured that his country will do everything in its power to fulfil the commitment of not allowing its territory to be used for terrorism against India.Besides, he gave an assurance that the investigation in the Mumbai terrorist attack case, taking into account the additional information obtained from the recent interrogation of David Headley, would be pursued vigorously to unravel the full conspiracy and bring all the perpetrators to justice, he said.\"The detailed and frank discussions held during the visit enabled both the countries to develop a better understanding of each others' position and points of view on various issues,\" he said.\"Despite differences of opinion on the way forward on a few issues, there was a broad understanding on a number of other issues,\" he added.(Description of Source: New Delhi PTI News Agency in English ) Material in the World News Connection is gene rally copyrighted by the source cited.

But then, matters in Kashmir have never resided strictly within the bounds of the ordinary and the expected. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, had to intervene in the crisis not only because the credibility of the state government in Jammu and Kashmir is in a shambles, but also because very few voices, even within the state, have carried Mr Singh's sincerity and openness. The prime minister's address to the people of the valley in Urdu should have also made plain the earnestness of his desire to reach out to those who have been most affected by the incessant violence. In his political message, Mr Singh naturally talks about addressing the \"alienation and emotional needs of the people\".The success of any communication, however, depends on how well it is received -- and there are problems here. The ascendancy of the secessionists means that the prime minister's message may not reach the people undistorted. The hard-line Hurriyat leader, S.A. Shah Geelani, has already rejected Mr Singh's peace offer, and the moderate Hurriyat leadership of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq is in no position to overturn that verdict. But the recalcitrance of the Hurriyat leadership or the stubborn refusal of the valley's mainstream political parties to amplify the Centre's peace message may not be the only problem. Mr Singh has talked about a political solution within India's Constitutional framework, one that would be subject to the political and economic realities of the time. This is not an entirely unique solution. From the limited autonomy of the National Conference to the sovereign \"azaad riyasat\" of the People's Democratic Party, ideas for Kashmir's future have swung wildly without ever reaching any concrete form. The Centre, most certainly, cannot impose a structure without internal consultation, which today seems no easier than it was yesterday, for it also involves sustained dialogue across the border. All plans, again, have demilitarization as their starting point, and this is not necessarily the case with Mr Singh's vision. There is another caveat that his message seems to have overlooked. How will the granting of autonomy to Kashmir look from the northeast of India, a region with as tortured a history as that of the valley?

Narsimha Reddy, alias Gaganna, who was arrested from Nawadih in Bokaro last week, has revealed that more than four dozen women were part of the rebels' army in Jharkhand, but not a single one of them was from the Mahto community.All the girls, he alleged, were either tribals or belonged to scheduled castes, a trend being followed by the Maoists in all t he other states.Reddy said if it was the Mahtos in Jharkhand, it was the Yadavs in Bihar and the Reddys and Raos in Andhra Pradesh who were members of local area committees that had exclusive rights to collect levy.\"If this is the way the rebels continue to function where tribals and those belonging to lower castes like Manjhi, Bhuiyan, Ganju and Kharwar would work for the armed wing to fight security forces, while the upper castes collected levy, the Maoists will have to pay a heavy price in the coming days,\" Reddy said during interrogation by senior police officers including IG (operations) R.K. Mallick, CRPF DIG Alok Raj and Bokaro SP Saket Singh.\"A revolt is now a distinct possibility,\" added Reddy.Reddy claimed local villagers, along with disillusioned young Maoists, were getting close to the police. That was the reason behind his own arrest and that of cadres like Anuradha Sharma, Ravi Sharma and Mohammad Hussain, alias Anna, that had left a vacuum within the Maoists leadership in Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand.In fact, Reddy claimed he was made in-charge of the Jharkhand sub-committee in 2007 and sent to the Palamau and Latehar areas to try and stem the tide of villagers turning against them.Reddy admitted there were serious differences between the Maoists' central leadership and its sub-area committees and said that on several occasions junior cadres had openly refused to toe the line.Reddy, who was lodged in Tenughat jail, was brought to Bokaro yesterday for interrogation after he was remanded to the custody of the district police. He will be questioned for the next two days by the senior police officers.Bokaro SP Saket Singh said Reddy also revealed several names. Those entrusted with collecting levy were Rajesh Mahto, alias Saranda Tiger, Ramchandra Mahto, Santosh Mahto, Ajai Mahto, Udai Mahto, Dharmendra Mahto, Nago Mahto and Bhuvneshwar Mahto.And those who were part of the armed squad that was forbidden from colle cting levy, were Navin Manjhi, Kundan Pahan, Ravi Manjhi, Pravir Manjhi, Pratiram Manjhi, Misir Besra, Pandu Manjhi (arrested) and Varun Manjhi.

Accompanying illustration This belt, geographically known as Schuppen belt, yielded results, and ONGC began production in March 1981. The oil giant estimated a geological reserve of 110 million barrels of oil with a recoverable reserve of approximately 1,600 barrels per day.Work, however, came to a halt in May 1994, following militant threats after extraction of a mere 7 million barrels of oil.Though production stopped and ONGC left Champang, fields continued to spout oil which seeped into the soil, rendering acres of farmland barren.Rivers and streams in the lowland are as were contaminated, affecting aquatic life.With crude petroleum staining large swathes of Champang, villagers fear that even a splinter could lead to a devastating fire.The landowners of Champang said there has been unabated spillage of petroleum for more than a week.\"But the state government has not done anything to contain the spillage and clean up the area,\" M. Yanathung Ngullie, president of Landowners' Union of Champang, said.The director of geology and mining, H.K. Chishi, said his department was concerned with the leakage and had sought immediate intervention by ONGC but his pleas had gone unheeded.The state government does not have adequate technology to stop the leakage, he said.The roads and bridges leading to Champang are in such bad condition that ONGC finds it difficult to transport heavy machinery to the area, he added.Champang villagers have other grievances too.Very little of the oil royalty has gone into local development, they allege.ONGC has pa id a royalty of Rs 33.83 crore to the Nagaland government, but of that only Rs 67 lakh reached the village.Talks, however, are on between the state government and ONGC to resume operations for exploration and production of petroleum products in Champang oil fields.

No decision has been taken and we will hold further talks soon,\" a Home Ministry official said.The meet was convened by Indian Home Ministry and was attended by officials of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and state-run service provider Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL).The discussion was aimed at finalizing the government strategy on Blackberry phones, which is facing the threat of being blocked in the country if the telecom service providers do not address gover nment's security concerns.Meanwhile, a top official of BlackBerry maker Research In Motion (RIM) - which has nearly one million subscribers in the country and has a growing market - paid a courtesy visit to Home Minister P. Chidambaram.Last week, BlackBerry had made a fresh attempt to break the logjam over its services in India by offering \"metadata\" and relevant information to security agencies, which will enable them to lawfully intercept communication on such phones but it failed to enthuse them.RIM representatives explained that BlackBerry mobile device sends encrypted e-mails, which is sent to BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) located with the service provider.BES decrypts messages and sends it to the e-mail server of the service provider, where it remains stored in decrypted form.

Katoch told PTI.He said the ministry will examine the issue in detail but it was \"unfortunate that this new bug, which is an environmental thing, has been attached to a particular country, which is India in this case\".\"I am surprised,\" he said, adding that, \"this (the bug) is present in nature. It is a random event and cannot be transmitted\".Katoch said that he was surprised that a research paper linked it with India as they should know it was a biological phenomenon.According to a paper published in scientific journal \"Lancet\", the new superbug, which is said to be resistant even to most powerful antibiotics, has entered UK hospitals, and is travelling with patients who had gone to countries like India and Pakistan for surgical treatments.Bacteria that make an enzyme called NDM-1 or New Delhi-Metallo-1, have travelled back with NHS (National Health Service) patients who went abroad to countries like India and Pakistan for treatments such as cosmetic surgery, it said.Although there have only been about 50 cases identified in the UK so far, scientists fear it will go global.NDM-1 can exist inside different bacteria, like E coli, and it makes them resistant to one of the most powerful groups of antibiotics - carbapenems.These are generally reserved for use in emergencies and to combat hard-to-treat infections caused by other multi-resistant bacteria.At least one of the NDM-1 infections the researchers analysed was resistant to all known antibiotics.Similar infections have been seen in the US, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands, and international researchers say that NDM-1 could become a major global health problem.Infections have already been passed from patient-to-patient in UK hospitals.Dr David Livermore, one of the researchers and who works for the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA), said: \"There have been a number of small clusters within the UK, but far and away the greater number of cases appear to be associated with travel and hospital treatment in the Indian subcontinent\".The Department of Health has already put out an alert on the issue, he said.(Description of Source: New Delhi PTI News Agency in English ) Material in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the source cited.

This was reported by the Indian television station Times Now with reference to unnamed sources. The report emphasizes that aircraft produced by Russia, the United States, and Sweden did not make it into the number of finalists, following the prosecution of a series of flight tests. The customer did not negotiate engines for the Russian \"4++\" generation MiG-35 fighter aircraft, Swedish Gripen (producer: SAAB) withdrew, due to its radar, and the F-16, produced by the American concern Lockheed Martin, was also declared an aircraft completely \"without a future.\" The reasons were not indicated in the report in regard to the removal of the F-18 Super Hornet, developed by Boeing, from the list of finalists. This information was not confirmed by OAK. Konstantin Lantratov, press secretary for OAK, reported to Kommersant that \"official results of the tender have not yet been announced.\" He had refused to comment on the television station's unofficial information. Mikhail Pogosyan, first vice president of OAK and head of MiG RSK, told Kommersant yesterday that \"the MiG-35 has not been removed from the tender. I do not have any official information about that.\" A Kommersant source close to MiG RSK confirmed that, on Saturday, when the Indian television station made public information on the intermediate summary of the tender, it had not yet been given out. The Kommersant source, having specified that the MiG-35 tests, with the participation of the Indian side, were concluded back in the fall of last year, noted that \"envelopes with the proposals are to be revealed by the tender commission only this week.\" Nevertheless, many Kommersant sources in the market are speaking of objective problems with the MiG-35, connected to insufficient financing of the project, due to the fact that the only potential customer for the aircraft is the I ndian Air Force. A Kommersant source close to the Rosoboroneksport FGUP (Federal State Unitary Enterprise), stated that OAK President Aleksey Fedorov put foward the issue of the necessity for state allocations of supplementary financing for the MiG-35 project back at the end of 2008. However, the problem was not resolved. In his opinion, one of the key problems is the debugging of the RD-33MK engine for the MiG-35. The Kommersant source, while refusing to specify the current time between overhauls for the RD-33MK, noted that \"the time between overhauls for the engine should be 2,000 hours, and the overall service life 4,000 hours. But the engine is currently falling short of these indicators.\" The Kommersant source in the Russian-Indian intergovernmental commission noted that the report of Russia's ouster from the Indian tender has come about on the eve of the next session of the intergovernmental commission, which will begin on 30 August. He did not e xclude that, in this manner, the Indian side could be hinting at the necessity to improve the offer from the Russian participant in the tender. The advantage of the Russian proposal is in that the MiG-35 is the cheapest of the aircraft being presented for the tender. In the estimation of Konstantin Makiyenko, an expert from the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, the much more expensive Rafale costs in the order of 60 million euros ($79.5 million), while the cost of the MiG-35 is \"a little more than $40 million.\" Oleg Panteleyev, head of the Aviaport analytical service agency, presumes that, \"the relationship of the combat capabilities and the price will unconditionally be one of the primary criteria for the acceptance of a decision by the government.\" He added that the strong suit of the MiG-35 is also in the vast experience in Russian-Indian military cooperation. The expert gave a reminder that \"in the post-Soviet period production of the MiG family of aircraft under license was successfully launched. In addition, a contract was concluded for the delivery of MiG-29K ship-based fighter aircraft.\" However, according to Mr Makiyenko, in the end it cannot be excluded that India is reconsidering the conditions of the tender as a whole: \"It would be logical to reformulate the tender for the fifth-generation aircraft,\" due to the fact that the country's Air Force is counting on utilizing these fighter aircraft for no less than 50 years.

Salma Malik conducted the proceedings. The second day proceedings mainly consisted of interactive sessions in three groups on Russia and US, led by former ambassadors Tanvir Ahmad Khan and Ali Sarwar Naqvi respectively, whereas group on China was led by Akram Zaki and Prof Zhou Rong. Muhammad Ali in his presentation on Russia said that Rus sia remained confined to one key regional actor, mainly India, and its biggest yet singular selling commodity has been military hardware. Owing to this unifocal approach, Russia since decades failed to claim a space for itself in the region. The implications, and interactive opportunities for Pakistan vis-a-vis Moscow can be a better cooperation over energy as a viable selling commodity, he said adding that it although would not replace US as the most important player in the region, at least Russia can have a viable niche in countries other than India. Shah Fad representing US group said that said that US has de-hyphenated India and Pakistan to deal with these countries at its own terms, where nuclear energy cooperation with India is necessary for strengthening New Delhi as a future regional proxy, Pakistani nuclear ambitions must be harnessed. There is a need to maintain a rough parity between India and Pakistan and better economic and energy sector engagements with India will set the course for future. China in comparison to Russia will set the future regional dynamics and the US must be wary of that and prepare India accordingly, he said. Salma Shaheen representing group on China said that Chinas interest is to counter Indian influence in the region and wants to deeper relations with Pakistan to balance out India. She said Beijing further wants to maintain healthy relations with regional states and avoid confrontation and aims at peace and stability. As an important regional power, China also wants to keep a check on NATO plan in the region and the efforts of US and other powers. China is also concerned about the terrorism and separatists movements in the region which is closer to its Muslim-majority Xinjiang province. She said Beijing has serious concerns about climate changes and with regard to nuclear issues; it is preparing second strike capability. The key challenges faced by the country are; poverty, communication barrier (language), growing positive Indian image in the world community and perceived upcoming threats. She said China wanted refraining India and Pakistan from edging towards any nuclear crisis and also interested in a stable and strong Pakistan.

Sudershan Reddy and S.S. Nijjar asked counsel for the State to respond, he said Salwa Judum did not exist. Justice Reddy told him: \"Your assertion is contrary to reports of various independent expert groups on the presence of Salwa Judum. You tell us why the State can't disband Salwa Judum.\"Earlier senior counsel Ashok Desai, appearing for petitioners Nandini Sundar and others, maintained that Salwa Judu m was constituted to terrorise people. He explained how the National Human Rights Commission highlighted the atrocities of Salwa Judum and asked the State to register cases. Though First Information Reports were registered, he said, prosecution did not take place since there was no further enquiry. Rehabilitation plan Mr. Desai said though the State was asked to come out with a rehabilitation plan, it drew up one that only covered Salwa Judum supporters, ignoring the victims of vigilante groups and state violence. The State was also asked to ensure that police forces vacated schools, hospitals, ashrams and anganwadis which they had used as camps, but it did not comply with this order.He wanted an independent committee to monitor the implementation of the rehabilitation plan.Additional Solicitor-General Vivek Tanka, appearing for the Centre, informed the court that it was the State government that provided the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) with accommodation. The force would accept whatever accommodation given to it. The Bench listed the matter for Thursday for further hearing.

And if this sector was not to be opened to private players, the bill was not needed. This view was repeatedly articulated by Arun Jaitley and other senior party leaders.However, on Wednesday, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj conceded \"such legislation is indeed needed, but it must be India-specific.\" She also said the party would accept the gov ernment's assurance that there was no plan for opening up the nuclear sector to private operators.The government that had capped liability at the first level at Rs. 500 crore was now prepared to consider the Opposition demand for \"unlimited liability\" to be administered entirely through a claims commissioner, instead of splitting up the liability at two different levels.\"If the bill is re-drafted and shown to us, if it is India-specific, we can agree to it. We are not opposing the bill for the sake of opposing it; we do need such a law,\" Ms. Swaraj said. She added her party did not think there was any need for India to contribute to and become a member of the Convention on Supplementary Compensation. \"We can set up our own fund. We have suggested that.\"She said during the meeting after \"listening to us,\" Mr. Mukherjee said \"there could be some meeting ground.\"The government indicated it was ready to hold a similar dialogue wi th the Left parties, but they, it said, seem to have taken a \"political decision\" not to support the bill.The government rejected a suggestion by the Opposition it was in a hurry to get the bill through Parliament ahead of the visit of United States President Barack Obama. \"We have to get the bill through. That is our responsibility, as it is also to try and take other parties along. We need the bill and that is recognised by the Opposition too. What has that to do with Mr. Obama's visit?\"As he came out of the meeting with Mr. Mukherjee, Mr. Jaswant Singh said the BJP cannot be \"hustled.\" He conceded that a national law was necessary and nuclear civil liability arising should cover any accident -- not only new nuclear plants but also existing ones as well as those in the strategic sector.Mr. Bansal said the government was making an effort to get the BJP on board, but primarily the power and responsibility for drafting the bill rested with it.

The SP MLAs, incensed at some remarks made by Irrigation and PWD Minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui, stormed the well and later staged a dharna and ignored the Speaker Sukhdev Rajbhar's plea to return to their seats.Mr. Rajbhar repeatedly asked the Leader of the Opposition, Shivpal Singh Yadav, to tell his MLAs to take their seats.The Supplementary Grants of Rs.5,461 crore was passed by voice vote amidst the din even as the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress staged a walkout in protest against the funds sought for parks and memorials.The Muslim issue figured during Zero Hour with the SP drawing attention towards the plight of the minority community and their abject living conditions in the light of the Sachar Committee report. .While Imran Masood and Iqbal Mahmood demanded separate reservation for Muslims, Shadab Fatima said not a single Muslim was the district magistrate or DIG in the State. Ghazala Basheer wanted steps to be taken to protect the graveyards from encroachment and Arif Anwar Hashmi said the representation of Muslims in government jobs should increase.Matters came to a head when the Irrigation Minister said there were 31 Muslim MLAs in the BSP (as compared to 15 in the SP) and he could not be stopped from speaking. Mr. Siddiqui's r emark that he did not believe in \"hallabol\" (attack) saw the SP MLAs enter the well and raise slogans dubbing the Mayawati regime as \"anti-Muslim.\"The agitated SP members staged a dharna following Parliamentary Affairs Minister Lalji Verma's comment that the Muslims had been misled by the Samajwadi Party.The Assembly was adjourned for the day following the passage of the grants.

The game was up for the second year BSc student from a reputed city college on Wednesday, when he was nabbed by the anti-terrorism squad (ATS).Hours after he was picked up, investigators found out that Kashyap was \"experimenting with his passion and knowledge\". The media houses received the mail on August 7 and the sender identified himself as Imran Azhar Khan. A resident of Central Railway colony in Kurla and son of a motorman, Kashyap had been hacking and misusing internet accounts as his family could not afford to have a connection at home.\"During a preliminary interrogation, he told us he sent the mail as a prank. We are probing the matter further since it i s a sensitive case,\" said Nasir Kulkarni, assistant police inspector, ATS.He has been booked under various sections of the Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code and remanded in police custody till August16. Senior ATS officials said since Kashyap hacked into other's net accounts, it was difficult to trace him and they were on a wild goose chase until they traced him.The cyber team of the ATS got cracking after the media houses received the messages and traced the sender's address: yuvrajpatil00@gmail.com. The investigators first picked up a youth from Ghatkopar for preliminary enquiry. However, he was let off. A few days later, the ATS picked up a businessman from Ghatkopar, who was a cloth merchant and shuttled between Surat and Mumbai.\"While questioning him, we found out that his computer had been out of order for the last six months,\" said a senior ATS official. A team of cyber experts were called in to scrutinising his system and that's when they figured that someone else was tampering with it. \"Eventually, we traced the mischief to Kashyap,\" added the official.

The oil slick has also reached the high tide mark in these areas. Experts say that the leak has set an ecological disaster in motion, which will see many casualties. The only thing is the casualties will not include human beings now. But as the lower strata of the food chain gets affected, even that possibility cannot be denied. According to experts, contamination transfers to higher levels of food chain soon after it reaches the lowest strata. There have already been reports of dead sea-snakes, smeared with oil, being spotted on the Uran beach and the mangroves turning black in Vashi in Mumbai. Worst affected Sasawne in Konkan is one of the worst-affected areas. The stench of the oil can be smelled from as far as 150 metres\"I spotted the tentacles of so many small filter feeders (animal-like sponges which filter food particles from the sea) and other small sea animals full of oil here,\" Mr. Apte said during the field visit to the affected areas. He showed sea algae swathed in oil. \"They will all die,\" ; he said. Though the Mandwa beach looks comparatively cleaner from a distance, if one stands on the shore, the sand around the feet, which erodes after the wave, leaves a glistening rim bordering the footmarks. Just a bit of digging in the sand reveals a thin layer of oil that has already percolated in the sand and has formed a thin film beneath. This film asphyxiates all the life forms beneath it. Walking on this beach tars one's feet. Dipping the hands in the sea at Sasawne greases the palms. Worrisome This is worrisome as it is a much richer area in terms of marine biodiversity and has lots of sensitive species. This region also breeds marine organisms such as lobsters and oysters. They survive on dead and decaying material in the sea and the filter feeders. The disturbance in this breeding ground is set to have an adverse impact on the livelihood of the people there, as that is their primary source of survival. Affects tourism The oil contami nation in the sea is also set to affect the tourism in this region, which is an all-time favourite weekend destination for many from Mumbai, Pune and nearby cities. \"People come here with their families to set out in the open and beautiful sea. With this leak, the entire area is contaminated now. Who would want to come here to smell the oil?\" asked Ravi Apte, who owns a home stay facility close to the sea shore in Sasawne. The area is also known for turtle nesting. December to February is the nesting season here. \"As the oil has percolated in the substrata of the sand, it is very difficult for the eggs to hatch. Even if you come here after three years, you will still find the oil here,\" Mr. Deepak Apte said. The villagers are primarily concerned about their livelihood now. \"The government has issued a warning against going in the sea. But this is festive season for us with raksha bandhan and other festivals. We cannot celebrate in this condition,\" said Ramchandra Nakwa, a fisherman from Revas. The slipped containers of the ship have goods strewn across the beach. People have been carrying bagful of tea powder, biscuits and other goodies for the past three days. Experts do not discount the possibility of their contamination, but the villagers ignore the warnings.

Rising “grid diplomacy” and cross-border energy links are binding neighbors closer together—creating both resilience and shared vulnerabilities. → Divergent energy paths shaping geopolitics India, China, Brazil, and others are shaping new energy alliances and setting their own standards based on competitive advantages in natural resources, energy self-sufficiency shifts away from fossil fuels, and technological exports. Strategic energy independence actions are strengthening to reduce geopolitical exposure to former trade partners. JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 3 Executive Summary: Power Rewired Energy has always been intrinsic to geopolitics. Throughout history, competition over resources and innovations have fueled global rivalries, created alliances, and sparked wars. Yet today, the traditional energy security paradigm—rooted in supply diversification and market liberalization, and centered on hydrocarbons—has given way to new forms of infrastructure nationalism, resource weaponization, and partnerships shaped by technological and mineral interdependence. Today’s contest is no longer just about barrels and pipelines. It’s about who controls minerals, grids, financing, and technologies that will power the 21st century. In this New Energy Security Age: • Energy security is industrial strategy. • Infrastructure is a tool of diplomacy. • The global energy order has the potential to fracture into rival blocs with divergent interests and supply networks. Artificial intelligence (AI) has only supercharged this shift. The data centers driving the AI race require gigawatts of stable electricity, forcing governments to treat power as a strategic asset on par with oil in the 20th century. Otherwise, they risk missing out on a new wave of innovation and economic growth as the technology transforms societies. This is not a single contest, but many overlapping ones—rooted in geography, natural resources, innovation, and industrial capacity. Competitive advantages in natural resources domestically and with allies are leading to divergent behavior globally as countries seek to increase power supply and invest in domestic infrastructure, including for AI. Policy and technology innovation determine how these cards are played. While the U.S. is focused on nuclear, geothermal, and liquified natural gas (LNG) exports, nations from India to China to Brazil are forging new alliances around energy self-sufficiency through solar, storage, nuclear, coal, and standards-setting. Three structural shifts are now redrawing the global energy landscape: • Resources • Infrastructure • Technology Risking oversimplification, Figure 1 summarizes the state of resource availability and technological innovation focus across the globe that we further analyze in this report. While maps of this nature are not traditionally utilized to support investment theses or make asset allocation decisions, they are foundational to understanding how governments view and assess strategic choices related to developing their domestic economies, assessing their competitors, and forging diplomatic relations and trading partners. This has direct and clear impacts for businesses operating in these geographies. Using this security-focused lens, we conclude that clear competitive advantage for fossil fuel dominance is in North America, the Middle East, and Asia. However, other sources of energy production see additional strategic advantages in North America and Asia, but also Africa, Australia, South America, and Europe. Water availability, sunshine, wind, geothermal access, critical minerals, and technology innovation provide additional strategic national resource advantages. Technology innovation—especially for those with self-sufficiency to move away from fossil fuels—has had historic advantages in the U.S., EU, Russia (nuclear) and Australia, but is gaining in Asia. JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 4 Figure 1. Comparing comparative advantage: energy distribution across continents Note: Nuclear is based on uranium fuel access and geothermal is based on 2,000m depth. The natural resource hand that individual countries have been dealt is not necessarily deterministic. Both price and geopolitics will play a role in how regions choose to further develop their natural resources to build out energy infrastructure for independence or cross\u0002border partnerships. Geopolitics and national security interests will increasingly influence market-driven principles, changing how resources are used and which technologies scale. This may alter the total addressable market size for certain technologies, companies, or resources, limiting growth in some areas and accelerating it in others. If you assume energy supply growth will be prioritized above other considerations, then an “all of the above” approach will be taken, optimizing for strategic advantages within one’s borders and trading partner allies. Access to pools of specialized capital to support specific energy technologies, either from the private sector or governments, will speed or slow deployment; however, energy security considerations will drive growth overall. Business leaders need to familiarize themselves with these changing dynamics in order to best capitalize on emerging global dynamics. Financial success will hinge on understanding how geopolitical shifts impact future investments and are included in strategic planning. Those who can anticipate and adapt to these changes will be best positioned to capitalize on the opportunities and manage the risks that arise in this New Energy Security Age. JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 5 What is the New Energy Security Age? The New Energy Security Age is the emerging geopolitical era in which access to, control over, and resilience of energy systems have become primary determinants of national power and economic competitiveness. Unlike earlier periods when energy security was framed mainly in terms of oil shocks, diversification, and market liberalization, today’s picture is defined by: • Self-Sufficiency & Stability: The use of nuclear, geothermal, solar, wind, and storage to reduce reliance on fossil fuel imports and produce stable electricity prices to attract industry, as well as the export of electricity or domestic fossil fuels to allies.i • Minerals: Competition for critical materials (e.g. lithium, cobalt, nickel, rare earths) that underpin advanced technologies. • Infrastructure & Interconnection: Cross-border grids, pipelines, and digital-energy systems that both enable resilience and expose shared vulnerabilities. • Technology & Industrial Policy: The race to dominate strategic technologies (AI, batteries, advanced nuclear) where energy is both an input and an output. • Finance & Statecraft: The deployment of capital, subsidies, sanctions, and investment controls as levers of energy power. In this age, energy continues to be a front-line instrument of statecraft, shaping alliances, trade flows, and even conflict, but in new, more complicated ways as the landscape shifts from the dominance of hydrocarbons and demand skyrockets to meet new technologies. Figure 2. Who Will Define The New Energy Security Age? New Energy Security Age JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 6 Section One Mapped—The Uneven Energy Chessboard No energy source is universal. Geography still dictates strategic advantage—and disadvantage. Countries and regions have different competitive edges in natural resources. Optimization for energy production, especially with pressures from AI and its potential to transform technology and economies, will lead to countries seeking different energy paths depending on resource access and technological trajectories. The following five energy resource maps provide essential context for understanding how regions formulate energy security plans focused on emerging energy technologies for self-sufficiency: • Solar Irradiation • Wind Strength • Geothermal Potential • Australian Critical Mineral Deposits • North America’s Broad Competitive Advantage These maps quantify accessible resources for energy self-sufficiency, highlighting potential vulnerabilities and needs for cooperation, innovation, and investment. An important caveat: these maps highlight potential energy, without regard for the cost of extracting available resources, should innovation and investment fully unlock capacity. This is very specific to considering present and future national security, natural resource potential with technological innovation and investment leading to realized benefits. We’ve identified where innovation or differences in technology choice can operationally translate potential energy into realized energy produced. JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 7 1. It’s not always sunny in… Solar irradiation—or where the sun shines strongest to allow for solar panels to capture energy—is not distributed evenly across the globe. This is due to cloud coverage at the equator and less sunlight on an annual basis as you approach Earth’s poles. This means maximum solar potential for capture is only concentrated across two narrow bands of latitude that experience minimal cloud cover, as Figure 3 shows. Note: This is an atmospheric scientist measurement of solar energy at the surface of Earth, but energy production locally (solar capacity factor) will be a function of solar panel technology. This phenomenon means well-optimized solar projects bode particularly well for the American southwest, central Mexico, Chile, and Bolivia, as well as the northern and southern regions of Africa and Australia. However, investments have been the highest recently in China and India. Even traditionally rich petro-states like Saudi Arabia are taking advantage of their geography’s unique disposition for solar irradiation, as well as wind: in 2025, Saudi Arabia inked $8.3 billion worth of deals for five massive solar farms and two wind farms across the country, together totaling about 15 gigawatts of new renewable capacity. Figure 3. Where the sun shines: mapping irradiation hot spots around the world View text version JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 8 2.Wind power favors the poles and coastal waters As Figure 4 shows, wind strength is concentrated at both the northern and southern poles of the Earth. This contrasts with the solar irradiation bands seen in Figure 3, illustrating that while some nations may not enjoy reliable high-level exposure to one kind of renewable, that very same geography may pre-dispose them to another renewable source, such as wind. Case in point: In cloudy northern Europe, a consortium of “North Sea” nations are exploring the creation of artificial islands and “wind parks” in the Dogger Bank portion of the North Sea as a way to harvest the region’s high wind speeds. Given these power-per-area estimates are made with current technologies, further wind technology advancement could increase power potential. Ocean depths also play a role in site selection and viability with current anchored technology. We expect to see Northern Europe, Southern Australia, and North America have the advantage when it comes to harnessing wind potential in relatively shallow coastal shelf ocean waters where historic oil and gas infrastructure has also de-risked construction and operation. China also enjoys a strategic advantage in wind, which it is vigorously exploiting. In 2024, China added about 80 GW of new wind capacity, bringing its total to roughly 520GW, the most installed wind capacity globally, and pushing wind to account for 10% of China’s electricity generation. By the end of 2024, the United States ranked second with about 150 GW of installed wind capacity, while Germany stood third at approximately 73 GW, cementing Beijing’s status as the world’s largest wind power producer. Figure 4. Windy waters: mapping offshore destinations for turbine projects View text version JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 9 3. Hot stuff: Geothermal energy’s emerging potential in power production Until recently, the majority of geothermal power production has been concentrated in a few locations—the western U.S., Indonesia, Philippines, Turkey, Kenya, New Zealand, and Iceland— where geothermal energy resources are close to the Earth’s surface, i.e. within 2,000 meters. These are tectonically-active regions where the Earth’s plates meet and move. As a result, current geothermal production has been concentrated in countries with easily identifiable resources (e.g. near fault lines with earthquakes and volcanoes). However, with advanced drilling depth capabilities (down to 7,000m), geothermal productivity potential stretches around the world. Additionally, new horizontal drilling techniques can unlock additional energy from a single vertical well, maximizing more shallow resources. This technology is changing rapidly in the U.S. right now. Recently in Utah, Fervo Energy drilled a well to 15,765ft (4,805m) in a little over 2 weeks accessing temperatures of 5200F. The company is advancing horizontal drilling techniques to increase power production in a single deep well to maximize these temperatures found at great depth.ii These map estimates have the potential to be revised upwards globally with efficiency gains from new technologies and prospecting activities; i.e. while general productive areas are known globally, local potential requires measurements at the surface and subsurface. Unlike solar and windpower potential, which is observable from space, geothermal potential estimates require penetrating the Earth’s surface with drilling technology similar to that used in oil and gas exploration and operations. Given this required expertise, we expect the U.S. and Mexico to have the advantage in capitalizing on geothermal technology domestically and for exporting both electricity and technology. Figure 5. Digging deeper: geothermal opportunities expand at 7000 meters below Earth’s surface View text version JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 10 4.Australia hit the energy and minerals jackpot Few countries are as blessed with an abundance of renewable, fossil, and nuclear fuel deposits as is Australia. Few countries match Australia’s energy diversity: it is a top exporter of coal and LNG while also fielding excellent prospects for solar and wind power. As Figure 6 shows, it is also home to some of the world’s largest and most diverse reserves of critical minerals. At 49% of global production, Australia is the world’s largest producer of lithium (a key battery component), and a top supplier of cobalt, nickel, and other rare earth metals that power everything from semiconductors to medical devices to defense industry products. Australia is a major exporter of its mined raw materials, leaving it vulnerable to post-processed supply chains. It has recently laid out plans to build processing capabilities.iii With such abundance, we expect Australia to be a major player in the New Energy Security Age. Figure 6. I Come From the Land Down Under: Australia’s Rare Earths Abundance View text version JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 11 5. North America: Broad competitive advantage across energy sectors Energy Abundance, Global Leverage Since the 1800s, fossil fuels have powered industrial revolutions, built global trade systems, and today account for, roughly 40% of global seaborne trade by volume. This dominance stems from a combination of technological innovation, natural resource abundance, and decades of infrastructure development. Now, North America is uniquely positioned to leverage these advantages to pursue an “all of the above” energy strategy—mirroring China’s aggressive push to pair hydrocarbons with nuclear, solar, and wind. The Geography and Geology Edge North America’s energy advantage is rooted in its diverse natural resource base and favorable geography: • Solar: The sun-rich U.S. Southwest and Mexico’s northern states (Sonora, Chihuahua, Baja California) average 5.5 kWh/m²/day, placing them among the highest solar irradiation zones globally. Canada’s Alberta and Saskatchewan provinces also offer vast solar potential. • Wind: Mexico’s Isthmus of Tehuantepec is among the planet’s premier wind corridors, boasting consistent 10 m/s wind speeds, while the U.S. Northeast and Pacific Northwest are building world-class offshore wind projects. In Canada, Ontario and Quebec also deliver extensive wind resources. • Fossil Fuels: The U.S. and Canada rank among the top producers of oil and natural gas globally, with abundant shale reserves, extensive refining capacity, and world-leading LNG export infrastructure (see Figures 8 and 9). Mexico’s offshore oil fields and onshore shale reserves complement the region’s hydrocarbon dominance. AI, Energy, and the Clock While the Trump Administration has unleashed a slew of new hydrocarbon projects to drive down prices and boost U.S. production, these projects, including LNG export terminals and oil refineries, still face time constraints. Even when expedited, LNG terminals and refineries often require five years of permitting, financing, and construction. Solar and wind farms, by contrast, can be deployed faster to bridge the gap, typically in 2–3 years at scale, making them a strategic solution to meet immediate-term electricity demand driven by AI data centers, electrification, and industrial reshoring. This speed matters given the crucial window of the next 5–6 years, which will shape large language model training and accelerate AI adoption. JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 12 Regional Momentum North America is accelerating toward diversified energy mixes: • Mexico: President Sheinbaum’s 2025 Energy Reform aims to add 23 GW of capacity by 2030, heavily weighted toward solar and wind. • Canada: Renewables are projected to grow from 115 GW today to 149 GW by 2030, supported by federal and provincial investments. • United States: The U.S. added 12 GW of solar in the first half of 2025, with another 21 GW expected before year-end. Together, solar and wind now generate 17% of U.S. electricity, surpassing coal and expanding rapidly. Agrivoltaics: Energy Security Meets Food Security Strategically deploying solar and wind delivers a second dividend through agrivoltaics—integrating solar panels with active agricultural land. Rather than competing with farmland, agrivoltaic systems generate electricity while allowing crops to grow beneath or between arrays. This approach reduces land-use conflicts, improves soil moisture retention to improve water efficiency, and shields crops from extreme heat. These are common and growing issues across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. • Mexico: In arid northern regions, agrivoltaics are reducing irrigation needs for crops such as chili peppers and tomatoes, aligning energy transition goals with food security. • Canada: Alberta and Saskatchewan are testing dual-use systems to stabilize farm income and optimize land use. • United States: Pilot programs in Arizona and Massachusetts show yield improvements for certain crops while providing farmers secondary revenue streams for hosting panels. Strategic Imperative An “all of the above” approach—hydrocarbons, renewables, geothermal, and nuclear—positions North America to be one of the most flexible and resilient energy ecosystems in the world. In the race to meet surging power demand, the region’s ability to balance speed, diversity, and scale offers a distinct geopolitical advantage. Illustration by Tom Hickey and Al Hicks, NREL Figure 7.

View text version JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 15 Section Two Three structural shifts—in resources, infrastructure, and technology—are shaping the New Energy Security Age. Three transformative shifts are redefining how nations harness and manage their natural resources, influencing new geopolitical and economic strategies globally. Structural Shift 1: Critical Resources, Critical Leverage In the New Energy Security Age, control over both minerals and money translates into geopolitical leverage. The emergence of new technologies for energy, AI, and defense has introduced a new set of supply chains forming strategic advantages and vulnerabilities. Various competitive technologies—including chips, semiconductors, quantum, defense, space, battery storage, wind power, and nuclear—depend on the mining and refining of critical minerals, many of which are concentrated in fragile or geopolitically-contested regions. The scramble for minerals—like lithium in Chile (31% global reserves), cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo (55% global reserves), and nickel in Indonesia (42% global reserves)iv—is reshaping trade and diplomacy. We provide a subset of critical minerals for these technologies in Figure 11, mapping out those with 5% or more of global reserves. Note: Depending on rarity and demand, fully processed small values of reserves may be just as important to a supply chain as less processed large values of reserves. This map shows critical mineral potential vs. realized available minerals. JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 16 Figure 11. All That Glitters Is Not Just Gold: Mapping Critical Mineral Deposits Globally Some governments are imposing export restrictions to retain their advantage and shape global supply chains. For others, dominance rests not only on resources in the ground and on refining capacity, but on control of capital flows—who finances the mines, who underwrites the factories, and who sets the standards for investment. These can present business risks if standards and underwriting practices are set to support specific countries or entities. Outbound investment and export controls, sanctions, and restrictions on foreign participation in energy infrastructure and supply chains are becoming standard tools of economic statecraft. Countries that dominate development banks, sovereign wealth flows, or global bond markets are able to steer the direction of energy investment—tilting the playing field in their favor. This weaponization of critical mineral supply chains and finance marks a structural shift: critical minerals and renewable resources are not just traded commodities, they are strategic levers in a broader geopolitical contest that defines the New Energy Security Age. JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 17 • China has a tight grip on global critical mineral supply chain and refining capacity. Beijing’s export restrictions on graphite and gallium—critical to batteries and semiconductors—demonstrate how midstream processing capabilities can be repurposed as tools of coercion. Its outbound investment screening and competing subsidy regimes are also turning energy technology into a central front in the U.S.-China rivalry. Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative and state banks provide loans for energy (especially solar, battery storage, nuclear) and transmission projects in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. These packages have two outcomes: (1) partner countries become less reliant on fossil fuels to develop energy independence; and (2) they are often tied to Chinese equipment and labor, cementing China’s market share, influence, and technological partnership. Crucially, this is not just a money-making exercise. Beijing views the expansions of its energy and financing leadership as part of a deliberate strategy to reduce dependence on imported crude and natural gas, moving China toward greater self-sufficiency, and giving it leverage—over trade partners and over standard-setting in forums like the United Nations. Figure 12. Beijing’s Green Thumb: China dominates global clean tech supply chains 83% 89% 97% 85% 86% 87% 96% 91% 85% 71% 86% 80% 66% 71% JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 18 • The United States and its allies are moving rapidly to onshore or “friend-shore” production, reflected in U.S. policy support for new energy technologies (especially nuclear and geothermal), the EU Green Deal, and Japan’s GX Strategy. With a shift in administration, Washington has refocused on deploying tens of billions in Department of Energy loan guarantees that advance and scale the mining, processing, and manufacturing of critical minerals and underwrite grid modernization, nuclear, and battery storage projects. These tools are designed not only to lock in private investment and shorten deployment timelines, but also to ensure allied supply chains remain resilient and insulated from adversarial control. LNG offtake agreements have been a part of tariff negotiations. To close trade negotiations, the EU pledged to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy exports (including nuclear technology and fuel, LNG, and crude oil) through 2028.v • Indonesia has used its dominant position in nickel and bauxite production and reserves to impose a raw export ban and catalyze domestic refining investment, which may serve as a model for other resource-rich states seeking to retain more of the economic and strategic value of their resources at home. For example, Guinea has followed Indonesia’s example by taking actions like transferring assets to state-backed firms against bauxite companies for failing to meet domestic processing commitments, with the goal of boosting its own downstream industries. Expect to see critical minerals play a central role in future international negotiations, from trade agreements to peace settlements. Whether it is Washington wrestling Beijing to re-permit its export of certain critical minerals during tariff negotiations, or the recently-brokered Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)-Rwanda peace deal centered on critical minerals access, governments are increasingly including critical minerals and their technologic derivatives as a core tenet of international negotiations, with countries leveraging their supplies for security and foreign direct investment. JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 19 Structural Shift 2: Growing Grid Entanglement—Resilience Meets Risk Increased cross-border electricity integration is being driven by strategic necessity as well as diplomacy. It allows countries to balance natural resource supply and demand across borders, stabilize volatile renewable flows, and scale electrification faster than national grids can manage alone. Energy cooperation also serves as a trust-building mechanism, as a lever for regional influence, and builds regional energy resilience through source diversification. But “grid diplomacy” also creates shared vulnerabilities—from cyberattacks, natural disasters, and physical sabotage to regulatory shifts and energy nationalism—that raise the stakes of alignment. A breakdown in one part of a shared grid can cascade across borders, and tensions between neighbors can quickly become energy crises. In an era of rising geopolitical friction, the interdependence of energy infrastructure is both a source of resilience and a point of risk—much like Russia’s historic leverage over European gas pipelines during the age of oil and mass production. • Europe: Energy infrastructure, both renewable and non-renewable, is rapidly being built to meet European nations’ strategy to diversify away from Russian-sourced pipeline oil (See Figure 13). Figure 13. No More Bear Oil: Europe’s large-scale LNG pivot JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 20 According to the Global Energy Monitor, the EU has proposed, revived, or fast-tracked 30 LNG terminal projects since early 2022. The EU has also deployed new floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs)-notably in Germany, Finland, and Greece-to diversify supply routes and build new infrastructure in record time. This infrastructure build-out has made Europe the largest global importer of LNG, relying heavily on supplies from the United States and Qatar. On the electrification side, new “grid alliances” are also emerging, such as the Baltic nations of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia’s recent decision to retrofit their electrical grids away from the joint Russian-Belarusian grid and instead connect to the more geopolitically secure “Continental European Network” (CEN) regulated by the EU. Ukraine, too, is already taking steps to ensure its post-war reconstruction energy infrastructure is rebuilt under EU standards. • Middle East: The Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Authority (GCCIA) has spearheaded a regional energy grid initiative since 2009 to connect the power grids of Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. As Figure 14 shows, this grid alliance provides a safety net against blackouts and facilitates a more reliable supply of electricity, especially during periods of peak demand or emergencies. According to the GCCIA, the GCC grid has already generated $3 billion in economic savings for member states since 2009 and may create opportunities for electricity trading with neighboring regions. Potential next steps for the GCC’s grid include developing “electricity highways” to Europe, allowing for the exchange of surplus energy during seasonal peak demands or, in the long-term, developing a broader “pan-Arab” electricity market. Figure 14. Protons for peace: the Gulf’s “grid diplomacy” JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 21 • Asia-Pacific: Several technologies are being built out. LNG import terminals have been built across Japan and China. Japan and Australia are investing in hydrogen hubs and regional supply corridors. ASEAN’s Power Grid initiative—which aims to create a multilateral electricity market across Southeast Asia—is gradually linking national grids (see Figure 15). Laos, branding itself as the “Battery of Southeast Asia,” is already transmitting hydropower to Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore.

ASEAN’s energy alliance: doubling down on electrical exchanges • Latin America: Regional power integration is advancing through efforts like the Andean Electrical Interconnection System and the Central American Electrical Interconnection System (SIEPAC), which connects six countries and is expanding to include Mexico and Colombia. Brazil and Argentina also share significant cross-border electricity flows with Brazil exporting surplus hydropower during peak periods. Brazil is the second largest global hydropower producer with 56% of total electricity use in 2024 (see Appendix, Figure 23). JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 22 • Africa: The African Union’s Continental Power System Master Plan is guiding interconnection goals. Key regional projects—such as the Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP), the West African Power Pool (WAPP), and the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP)—are enabling power exchanges between countries in each region, with further future interconnection across the continent. These efforts aim to increase energy access, lower costs, and harness the continent’s abundant renewable potential, from Ethiopian hydropower to Kenyan geothermal. Cross-continent, long-range subsea cables have also been under development. One project was to connect solar-rich Morocco to the UK, though it recently lost government support with the UK Energy Minister stating a preference to build homegrown power before relying on substantial imports from Africa.vi The connection may ultimately end up in the EU.vii Figure 16. I Bless The Rains: Africa’s Hydropower Pools JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 23 Hot Zones: Where Energy Meets Conflict Russia–Ukraine Russia’s war against Ukraine transformed Europe’s reliance on cheap Russian gas. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline was abandoned. Nuclear is being reconsidered as a source provider. LNG terminals were fast-tracked across the continent. EU countries have cut Russian gas imports by more than half since 2021 and imposed sweeping bans on Russian oil. European utilities now pay a price for energy security in the form of higher volatility and infrastructure costs. According to the Household Energy Price Index (HEPI), households in EU capitals paid 36% more for electricity in January 2025 compared to January 2021, before the war in Ukraine began. The war also highlighted a disturbing battlefield tactic: the targeting of civilian energy infrastructure as a weapon of war. Russia, in turn, has deepened its energy ties with China and India. Middle East The Red Sea and Strait of Hormuz remain among the world’s most vital oil corridors. Approximately 20% of global oil and 20% of global LNG trade passes through the Strait of Hormuz. Iran’s threats to block Hormuz—and attacks by proxies in Yemen on shipping in the Red Sea—have again revealed the vulnerability of these shipping chokepoints, as well as the flexibility of the global trading system.viii In 2024, oil flow through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait dropped by 50% – averaging 4 million barrels per day, down from 8.7 million barrels per day in 2023, per the U.S. Energy Information Agency. As part of a longer-running trend, Middle Eastern countries are investing in new strategies focused on diversification and de-risking their energy supply chains: • Israel has deployed Sa’ar corvettes— warships armed with advanced surface\u0002to-air missiles—for the explicit mission of protecting its Leviathan and Karish offshore natural gas platforms from missile and drone threats. • The UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Oman have launched megaprojects in solar, wind, battery storage, and low-carbon hydrogen. • Saudi Arabia aims for 50% renewable power by 2030, supported by multi-gigawatt solar tenders awarded to TotalEnergies and EDF Renewables. • Egypt recently fast-tracked North Africa’s largest wind farm—Egypt’s 650 MW Red Sea project—projected to cut gas imports and stabilize power markets. JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 24 Structural Shift 3: Innovation & Powering the Next Technological Wave From AI to EVs, energy is at the center of the next wave of technological innovation and rivalry. Training large models on high performance computing systems requires immense volumes of stable power—measured in gigawatts—to function reliably, triggering new investment in high-capacity grids and data center power sourcing. From Pennsylvania’s new nuclear-backed AI data clusters to Abu Dhabi’s 5GW AI megapark, energy is now the limiting factor in digital power. Some estimate that AI will require a doubling of global data center power requirements to 68 gigawatts (GW) by 2027, almost equivalent to California’s total capacity in 2022. The International Energy Agency predicts global data center demand could reach 945,000 GWh (~108 GW per year) by 2030, exceeding the entire nation of Japan’s current electricity consumption. Governments are responding with muscular industrial policies – recognizing that AI dominance means securing energy dominance. They are increasingly investing not just in projects but in ecosystems—regional clusters of production, innovation, and finance to build next-generation energy industries. China leads the world in terms of both overall energy production and specifically electrical output—a crucial ingredient for the powering of data centers used to develop and train large-language AI models (see Figures 17 and 18). Figure 17. Global Powerhouses: Top-Power Generating Countries JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 25 Chinese central planners have explicitly tied AI data center development to energy production planning, with the stated goal that 80% of their data center energy be produced by renewable energy sources. By some accounts, Chinese data centers are expected to triple their electricity demands in the next five years. To support its objective, China has rapidly increased R&D spending over the last decade, resulting in scientific breakthroughs and new energy infrastructure. China now dominates EVs, solar, and battery markets, and is aggressively building influence through energy technology exports. At the same time, however, China’s domestic consumption strategy diverges from its clean energy narrative. The country still relies heavily on coal-based power plants—more than any other nation—to power its cities and factories. In 2024 alone, construction began on approximately 95 GW of new coal-fired plant builds – the most in nearly a decade – while work resumed on an additional 3 GW of suspended coal plant projects. This coal buildout reflects not only inertia in the system, but also a structural need for fast\u0002responding, reliable backup power beyond the capability of current battery storage systems to balance the intermittency of rapidly expanding solar and wind generation. With natural gas resources limited and expensive domestically, coal remains China’s primary dispatchable option to stabilize the grid. Even with a recent surge in wind and solar supply coming online in early 2025, contributing to a modest 1% year-over-year drop in CO₂ emissions in the first half of the yearix, coal remains China’s largest overall electricity generation resource. For the foreseeable future, Beijing will continue to deploy an energy strategy that seeks to dominate global strategy: seeking to dominate global renewable energy innovation, exports, and markets while still relying on sources like coal at home to power China’s industrial and technological rise. Figure 18. Current events: China takes the lead in electrical generation JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 26 Figure 19. Coal country: the US, India, China still lead the world in coal usage View text version JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 27 Nuclear: From Thorium to SMRs New research developments are reshaping and reinvigorating interest in nuclear—from novel reactor designs to the possibility of shifting fissile materials away from uranium to a more widely-available element like thorium. Public support for nuclear energy has varied globally over the years, and its historical headwinds will likely continue to color debate on the energy source. Significant nuclear disasters in Three Mile Island (1979) and Chernobyl (1986) reduced support for nuclear plants in some geographies, increased regulation for safety, and slowed the overall growth of deployment outside Russia and China. The 2011 meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan led to a second wave of anti-nuclear political backlash around the world—with several governments committing to phase out their nuclear programs in response. In the past half decade, however, nuclear power has experienced a resurgence in interest and investment – driven by both research breakthroughs and geopolitics (see Figure 20). The global energy price shock caused by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine made some governments and the public rethink their post-Fukushima aversion to nuclear, particularly in Europe. Facing a dramatic energy price hike due to the war in Ukraine, Belgium, for example, extended the operating licenses of their soon-to-be\u0002decommissioned reactors by 10 years. Later, in 2025, the Belgian parliament voted to repeal its 2003 nuclear-phase-out law entirely, opening the door to new nuclear development. The Swiss government has also stated it will seek to lift the country’s ban on the construction of new nuclear power plants following energy pricing uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. Figure 20. Going Nuclear: A Red Hot Sector in Construction and Investments $3.8 $0.9 $0.8 $0.2 JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 28 In Asia, countries are moving full-speed ahead in the pursuit of nuclear-forward energy mixtures and have the most recent experience in successful new builds. China currently leads the world in terms of number of new nuclear reactors in the construction pipeline through 2030. India’s government has set an ambitious target to grow nuclear capacity to at least 100 GW by 2047. Russia currently has 6 reactors under construction domestically and approximately 20 internationally. After Russia and China, South Korea has been building the newest plants worldwide in the last decade. The Philippines, whose government abandoned its nuclear energy program in the 1980s, now aims to have its first nuclear power plant operational by 2032 as electricity demand in the country is expected to triple by 2040. Materials matter. New research has led to interest in thorium as a different fuel source to power nuclear reactors. Thorium is three times more abundant in nature than uranium, with significant deposits in India (see Figure 21). Due to the use of molten salt for temperature control in thorium reactors inhibiting catastrophic meltdown, they are also considered less dangerous. As a result, India, China, and the European Union have been investing heavily in thorium reactor technology research and building demonstration projects. China’s Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics is developing a 10 megawatt (.01 GW) electric molten salt thorium reactor protype in the Gobi desert, while Danish firm Copenhagen Atomics recently received millions in EU funding to further develop a prototype for its “containerized” thorium molten salt reactor that is specifically designed to be mass-produced in a factory and for ease of transport. In the U.S., public-private partnerships are leading thorium technological development.x CO NFIDENTIAL Nuclear power Sources: 1 IAEA INFCIS; 2Our world in data: Ember (2025); Energy Institute - Statistical Review of World Energy (2025) h p WORLD DISTRIBUTION OF THORIUM DEPOSITS1 WORLD DISTRIBUTION OF URANIUM DEPOSITS1 h h g 0 TWh 20 TWh 100 TWh 500 TWh No data NUCLEAR POWER GENERATION, 2024 (TWH)2 Exp we wit per ave $63 (lin 11 Figure 21. Mapping Nuclear Power: Ingredients and Generation View text version JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 29 Nuclear Microgrids: Decentralized Energy with Strategic Upside. Small modular reactors (SMRs) have been operating on military nuclear submarines to strategically avoid refueling and reduce detectability. The ability to power remote defense assets and decades of success has driven new interest in broader, civilian deployment. If the technology successfully adapts and commercializes, their modularity makes them suitable for microgrids— self-contained energy systems that operate independently or in conjunction with the larger grid— offering enhanced resilience where grid access is limited. Enthusiasm for this energy solution is reflected in capital flows since 2021 (Figure 20). Investment theses for SMRs have been related to lowering carbon emissions of energy production (to access climate mitigation focused capital) and energy security. The U.S., Canada, and UK are targeting deployment before 2030, hoping to position SMRs as a geopolitical tool for energy access outside of North America. These could be strategically positioned in locations with limited wind or solar productivity, particularly in remote equatorial regions (Pacific Islands and Africa) where China or Russia have used energy access as leverage. Sub-Saharan Africa, too, is also exploring SMRs to power mining operations, remote communities (i.e. fossil fuel transport is difficult), and grid-limited regions. Floating Offshore Wind: Unlocking the Deep-Water Frontier Unlike traditional offshore wind turbines that are fixed to the seabed in shallow coastal waters, floating offshore wind platforms are anchored in place and can operate in much deeper waters—often 60 meters or more (see Figure 22). This expands the potential for wind energy generation to “blue-water” zones that were previously inaccessible, such as off the coasts of Japan, California, Norway, and parts of the UK. Because wind speeds are generally higher and more consistent farther offshore, these platforms could generate more reliable renewable power—without the coastal land-use conflicts or visual disruptions that often stall onshore and nearshore projects. The technology is still early\u0002stage and cost-intensive, but several pilot projects are underway, mainly led by European companies to both address regional energy needs (due to natural resource competitive advantage of stead strong wind flow) and position themselves for first-mover advantage in this emerging offshore segment.

JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 30 Spotlight on the R&D Race Scientific publications serve as a barometer of innovation output after years of investment. While China now vastly out publishes by volume, (see Figure 24) the U.S., UK, and Australia are more efficient, with each country individually producing more than 13% of the World’s most highly cited papers.xi As Figure 23 shows, China has been steadily ramping up investments in R&D; scientific output should continue to rise for years after these investments. Further commercialization of these discoveries will determine where new sectors emerge and drive economic growth. Patents serve to formalize and protect innovations on the path to commercialization. They reflect historic investment to achieve new and protectable discoveries, which can lead to emerging industries with further investment and scaling from the public and private sectors. As Figure 25 shows, cumulative patents over 2000-2024 reveal that in all measured countries except Saudi Arabia and Norway, energy patents for renewables outstrip those for fossil fuels. Note: differences in legal conditions contributes to higher numbers of patents in some countries to protect innovation. The most critical information in this figure is the weighting towards emerging energy technologies. Figure 23. Present Output & Future Innovation JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 31 Figure 25. Emerging energy technology patents dominate innovation for commercialization worldwide. Thousands Figure 24. Growth in scientific peer-reviewed published papers by major region JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 32 What we’re watching: → Will the U.S. fully embrace its potential for energy dominance? North America has a significant strategic advantage in energy because of the sheer number of energy resources it has a competitive advantage in—fossil fuels, solar, geothermal, and wind. If the U.S. fully takes advantage of all those energy resources, it will be unrivaled in the New Energy Security Age. But recent policy shifts from Washington are creating uncertainty for America’s offshore wind ambitions—which can be a key strategic advantage for the United States alongside fossil fuels, geothermal, and nuclear. The Northeast, for example, is increasingly energy constrained and needs drastically more electrons on the grid. Wind offers one of the fastest, scalable ways to deliver those electrons. If wind projects are sidelined, the U.S. risks being able to deliver those electrons and remain competitive. Will the U.S. embrace its potential for energy dominance using all resources at its disposal, including wind? Or will we see a pullback from key strategic resources like wind at the federal level—delaying projects and the pace at which North America can compete and lead? There is a developing industry working to exploit this strategic energy resource, but policy shifts could halt that development and risk investor capital already deployed. → Saudi’s Civilian Nuclear Program The Kingdom has long desired a “full-cycle” nuclear program, where Riyadh would have the ability to domestically enrich uranium for its reactors rather than import low-grade uranium from abroad. Geopolitical dynamics and non-proliferation considerations have stalled Riyadh’s ambitions for years, as existing nuclear powers tend to advocate against non-nuclear countries from developing in-house enrichment capabilities. But the Trump Administration, in its campaign to furnish closer ties with the Kingdom, may change all that—including “de-linking” the issue from Saudi recognition of Israel as the Biden Administration had done. The U.S. Energy Secretary recently told reporters he sees a “pathway” to a deal on U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear cooperation and to expect “meaningful developments” on the topic in 2025-26. Notably, thorium reactor technology removes the need for enriched uranium. If the technology advances in the EU or Asia, it could ultimately displace uranium reactor ambitions.xii → FDI in India’s Exploding Energy Economy to Enable Self-Sufficiency Construction and installation of renewable energy projects is exploding in India – with renewables representing 89% of India’s new installed power capacity in FY2025, the majority of which is solar. The Indian government aims to generate 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030. To achieve this, New Delhi is attempting to make foreign direct investment (FDI) as easy as possible in the sector, a goal which appears to be working: FDI in India’s renewable energy sector has surged from $1.6 billion in 2022 to $3.4 billion so far this year, cementing the country as a hot destination for foreign investors seeking to test and build the next generation of renewable energy technology for the country’s 1.45-billion-person customer base. As thorium reactor technology develops, India will be a prime location with ample thorium deposits for the first operational reactors. JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 33 → Energy Innovation & Diplomacy China and India have been increasing R&D spending and have the opportunity to expand their energy technology diplomacy as discoveries are commercialized—forging strategic partnerships with low- and middle-income countries seeking investment, infrastructure, and know-how. The European Union and China recently pledged an expanded partnership as part of this year’s EU-China Summit in Beijing, even as Brussels drives forward on a campaign to diversify its supply chains away from China. One of the agreements: to accelerate global renewable energy deployment.xiii → Will Outbound Controls Expand? The U.S. has already restricted semiconductor exports to protect its AI edge. Energy infrastructure may be next. With AI demanding immense power inputs, the next frontier of outbound investment screening could target U.S. capital flowing into foreign-owned AI-adjacent energy assets— especially in countries outside the American alliance system. This could bifurcate markets for certain technologies into American alliance vs. rest-of-the-world, reducing total addressable market size for each. → Australia’s Critical Minerals Moment Rich in numerous critical minerals, Australia is emerging as a linchpin in NATO-aligned mineral strategy. Its deep trade and defense ties with the U.S., UK, and EU position it to become a key partner in resilient, trusted supply chains for both energy and defense technologies. JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 34 Appendix Global Hydropower Potential and Development While the main text focuses on the importance of hydropower in Africa, this appendix provides a global view for those seeking comparable analysis for energy potential everywhere. Hydropower follows global river networks, heavily concentrating in mountain-fed watersheds globally. While an estimated 1/4 of all hydropower resources have been developed, food security (freshwater fish availability) and wider ecosystem impacts inhibit development at full capacity.xiv The World Bank has historically funded hydropower in developing countries to provide not only energy, but also reduce water supply volatility to improve food security and reduce flood risk.xv Figure 26: Hydropower Potential Distribution and Current Plants in 2020 View text version JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics Power Rewired: The New Map of Energy and Geopolitics 35 Figure 27.

Windy waters: mapping offshore destinations for turbine projects This is a world map showing global wind power potential and actual electricity generation from wind in 2024. The map uses color shading to represent mean wind power density, measured in watts per square meter (W/m²). The color scale ranges from blue (lowest power density, 0 W/m²) through green and yellow, to red (highest power density, 1000+ W/m²). Coastal regions and some offshore areas are highlighted in red and yellow, indicating high wind power density, while most inland areas are shaded blue and green, indicating lower wind power density. Large circles are placed over several countries to indicate their total electricity generation from wind in 2024, measured in terawatt-hours (TWh). The size of each circle corresponds to the amount of wind electricity generated: • Smallest circles: 50–100 TWh • Medium circles: 100–200 TWh • Large circles: 200–500 TWh • Largest circles: over 500 TWh Notable large circles appear over the United States, Brazil, several European countries, and China, indicating these are major wind power producers.

I Come From the Land Down Under: Australia’s Rare Earths Abundance This map displays the distribution and status of critical mineral deposits and mines across Australia in 2024. It highlights the locations of operating mines, mines under development or care and maintenance, and identified mineral deposits. Each site is marked with a distinct symbol: • Circles for operating mines • Triangles for mines under development or care/maintenance • Squares for mineral deposits Key Observations: • Western Australia (WA): Highest concentration of critical minerals, especially in the southwest and central regions; key producer of lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements. • Northern Territory (NT) & Queensland (QLD): Several operating mines and deposits, mainly in northern and central areas; important for manganese and rare earths. • South Australia (SA): Notable sites including Olympic Dam, a major source of copper, uranium, and rare earths. • New South Wales (NSW) & Victoria (VIC): Fewer sites, but some operating mines and deposits in eastern and southern regions. • Tasmania (TAS): A handful of mineral sites, contributing to national output. • Major projects like Greenbushes, Mount Holland, Olympic Dam, and Mount Isa are highlighted as key contributors. Geographical Trends and Summary: • The majority of critical mineral activity is concentrated in the western and northern regions of Australia, with sparser distribution in South Australian (SA) and Queensland (QLD). • Many mines and deposits are located in remote or rural areas, reflecting the geological distribution of Australia’s mineral resources rather than proximity to major cities. • Overall, Australia’s critical mineral resources are widely distributed, but Western Australia is the dominant region for both operating mines and mineral deposits. The map provides a comprehensive overview of the country’s strategic mineral assets, underlining the importance of ongoing development and exploration to support global supply chains for technologies such as batteries, electronics, and renewable energy.

He rejected broad diplomacy with Pakistan, stating, “Terror and talks cannot coexist,” and limited dialogue to counter-terrorism and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, signalling an unyielding security doctrine. Pakistan’s leadership, conversely, claimed its counterstrikes had deterred Indian aggression, emphasising strategic resilience. The April–May 2025 crisis, marked by intense but limited fighting, ended without clear strategic victories for either side. Intense US diplomacy averted nuclear escalation, but the fragile ceasefire, ongoing violations, and unresolved tensions underscore South Asia’s volatility as a nuclear flashpoint. This analysis is divided into two parts. The first examines the conflict’s origins, escalation dynamics, and the pivotal role of US mediation in securing a ceasefire. The second critically assesses tactical outcomes, strategic weaknesses, and the enduring Kashmir dispute, which continues to threaten regional stability. By integrating diverse perspectives and credible sources, this article aims to provide a nuanced understanding for policymakers, analysts, and scholars. **PART ONE: Origins, Escalation, and Ceasefire** The crisis erupted on April 22, 2025, with a devastating terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, where 26 Hindu tourists were killed. India attributed the attack to the Resistance Front, alleging links to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, though no conclusive public evidence was provided to substantiate the claim (Reuters, April 25). Pakistan categorically denied involvement, condemning the attack and calling for an international investigation led by the United Nations to establish the facts. [Centred Kashmiri Voice Challenges Hindutva Narratives In Farhan Chak’s Nuclear Flashpoint](https://thefridaytimes.com/13-Aug-2025/centred-kashmiri-voice-challenges-hindutva-narratives-in-farhan-chak-s-nuclear-flashpoint) In response, India launched “Operation Sindoor” on May 6–7, 2025, conducting airstrikes on nine suspected militant sites across Pakistan-administered Kashmir (Muzaffarabad, Kotli) and, unprecedentedly since the 1971 war, mainland Pakistan (Muridke, Bahawalpur) using Rafale jets equipped with precision-guided munitions. The strikes targeted alleged terrorist infrastructure linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, according to India’s Ministry of Defence. Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry reported 31 civilian deaths, labelling the strikes an “act of war” and denying any role in the Pahalgam attack (Reuters, May 8). Pakistan retaliated with Chinese-supplied J-10C fighters, targeting Indian airbases in Udhampur and Pathankot, exposing vulnerabilities in India’s air defence systems, including gaps in its ageing MiG-21 fleet and radar coverage. The clashes along the Line of Control (LoC) displaced tens of thousands, with at least 48 confirmed deaths, including civilians, soldiers, and alleged militants. India claimed its strikes eliminated over 100 militants and 35–40 Pakistani military personnel, supported by satellite imagery showing structural damage. Pakistan countered that its J-10 strikes killed 40–50 Indian troops, denied civilian losses on its side, and reported significant damage to Indian military infrastructure. These conflicting claims, unverifiable due to restricted access and the absence of neutral observers, fuelled a disinformation campaign. India ordered the removal of 8,000 X accounts for alleged disinformation, while Pakistan lifted a 15-month X ban to counter Indian narratives, further polarising public perceptions. Both nations’ nuclear capabilities—India with an estimated 180 warheads and Pakistan with 170 —amplified the stakes. In India, Prime Minister Modi, facing domestic pressure ahead of the 2026 elections, sought to project resolve against terrorism, a cornerstone of his Bharatiya Janata Party’s platform. In Pakistan, General Asim Munir emphasised the military’s “strategic resilience,” leveraging the crisis to bolster domestic support amid economic challenges. The deployment of Pakistan’s J-10C fighters, armed with PL-15 beyond-visual-range missiles, underscored a qualitative shift in regional air power dynamics, challenging India’s traditional dominance. [South Asia’s New Warfare: How The 2025 India-Pakistan Clash Redefined Modern Conflict](https://thefridaytimes.com/21-May-2025/south-asia-s-new-warfare-how-the-2025-india-pakistan-clash-redefined-modern-conflict) **Turning Point: The Nur Khan Strike** The conflict’s most alarming escalation occurred when India struck near Pakistan’s Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi, just 10 kilometres from Islamabad and perilously close to Pakistan’s nuclear command-and-control centres. The New York Times reported that the attack “raised fears of a direct hit on nuclear infrastructure,” given the airbase’s strategic significance. The strike prompted immediate US diplomatic intervention, driven by concerns that miscalculation could trigger nuclear escalation, especially given the short flight times of ballistic missiles (8–12 minutes) between the two nations. Pakistan responded with a large-scale counteroffensive, targeting 26 Indian military installations, including airbases and army facilities in Suratgarh, Sirsa, Adampur, Bhuj, Naliya, Bathinda, Barnala, Harwara, Avantipur, Srinagar, Jammu, Mamoon, Ambala, Udhampur, and Pathankot. Pakistan’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) claimed “substantial damage” to Indian assets, though independent verification was limited. The escalation highlighted the absence of robust bilateral crisis communication channels, a longstanding concern among analysts like Moeed Yusuf, who have warned of miscalculation risks in South Asia’s nuclearised environment. **US Mediation and the Ceasefire** On May 10, 2025, at 5:00 PM IST, a ceasefire was announced after four days of intense fighting, brokered through US-led diplomacy. The Trump administration, initially reluctant—Vice President JD Vance had called the conflict “not America’s business”—shifted course as nuclear risks became apparent. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vance engaged Modi, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and other officials over 48 hours, leveraging economic incentives, including promises of trade enhancements, to secure compliance. President Trump claimed credit on Truth Social, hailing the “full and immediate ceasefire” as a diplomatic triumph. [The New Normal? Strategic Surprises And Nuclear Risk In South Asia](https://thefridaytimes.com/29-May-2025/the-new-normal-strategic-surprises-and-nuclear-risk-in-south-asia) Despite the truce, violations were reported within hours. India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of “repeated violations” through artillery fire in Srinagar and Jammu, ordering a “strong response”. Pakistan denied the charges, alleging Indian provocations along the LoC. Local residents reported overnight shelling, though fighting subsided by May 11. Kashmiris, wary of both nations’ adherence, expressed scepticism about the ceasefire’s durability, citing historical violations during the 2003–2019 period. A significant point of contention remains India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, enacted days after the Pahalgam attack. A source within India’s foreign ministry told CNN that the suspension is indefinite, with no linkage to the ceasefire, which was initiated by Pakistan. The move, seen as economic coercion, has heightened tensions, as the treaty has been a rare area of bilateral cooperation since 1960. **PART TWO: Tactical Dynamics and Strategic Implications** **Introduction** This section analyses the 2025 conflict using sources like The Financial Times, The New York Times, CNN, Reuters, Jane’s Defence Weekly, SIPRI, and Chinese state media to assess tactical outcomes, strategic shifts, and escalation risks. It examines: How did Pakistan’s J-10C fighters alter the regional balance? Could India’s vulnerabilities spark an arms race, increased militarisation of Kashmir, or a revanche-driven clash? Incorporating Chinese state media perspectives, Pakistan’s economic limits, and nuclear risks prompting US intervention, it provides a balanced view. Readers should approach conclusions cautiously, as the crisis remains an unresolved chapter in South Asia’s history. The analysis examines six dimensions: - Competing damage claims and verification challenges. - Chinese state media perspectives. - Pakistan’s J-10C fighter capabilities. - India’s budgetary and capability response. - Pakistan’s defence policy under economic constraints. - India’s strategic response, assessing risks of an arms race, Kashmir militarisation, or revanche. **Competing Damage Claims: Narratives and Verification Challenges** [Two Questions Which Will Have Determining Impact On The Fate Of Nuclear Deterrence In South Asia](https://thefridaytimes.com/31-May-2025/two-questions-which-will-have-determining-impact-on-the-fate-of-nuclear-deterrence-in-south-asia) The 2025 conflict is characterised by divergent casualty and damage claims, exacerbated by restricted access, disinformation, and the absence of neutral verification, which hinders de-escalation and fuels mistrust. **India’s Narrative** India’s Ministry of Defence claimed that “Operation Sindoor” targeted Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed camps, killing over 100 militants and 35–40 Pakistani military personnel. New Delhi released satellite imagery showing heat signatures and cratering at strike sites in Muzaffarabad, Kotli, Muridke, and Bahawalpur, asserting precision strikes. European defence analysts confirmed structural damage but noted that casualty figures remain provisional without on-ground verification, as access was restricted by both nations. India framed the strikes as a necessary response to cross-border terrorism, reinforcing its zero-tolerance policy amid domestic outrage over the Pahalgam attack. **Pakistan’s Rebuttal** Pakistan’s ISPR claimed its J-10C counterstrikes on May 10 killed 40–50 Indian soldiers, destroyed forward posts, and caused significant damage to airbases, while denying civilian casualties on its side. The ISPR reported 31 civilian deaths from Indian strikes, accusing New Delhi of targeting civilian areas to justify escalation. The United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) documented ceasefire violations but lacked access to verify casualties or damage, citing security restrictions. Pakistan’s narrative emphasises defensive success and accuses India of disinformation to mask strategic failures. **Disinformation and Social Media** Disinformation amplified mistrust, with India ordering the removal of 8,000 X accounts for spreading alleged falsehoods. Polarised X posts complicated verification efforts. The absence of credible, independently verified data enabled both sides to sustain competing narratives, risking further escalation in public and political spheres. [The Fragile Balance: Nuclear Deterrence And Escalation In South Asia](https://thefridaytimes.com/02-Jun-2025/the-fragile-balance-nuclear-deterrence-and-escalation-in-south-asia) **Civilian and Humanitarian Impact** Non-governmental organisations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), reported tens of thousands displaced along the LoC, with shelling destroying homes, schools, and clinics in border areas (Reuters, April 25). The ICRC urged both nations to protect civilians, but attributing responsibility for specific damages remains challenging without neutral observers. The humanitarian toll, including disrupted access to healthcare and education, underscores the need for robust verification mechanisms to counter disinformation and support post-conflict recovery. **The S-400 Controversy: Pakistan’s Claims vs. India’s Denials** A major point of contention arose from Pakistan’s claim that its JF-17 Thunder jets, equipped with hypersonic missiles, destroyed India’s S-400 air defence system in Adampur, Punjab, during “Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos.” Valued at $1.2 billion, the Russian-made S-400, known as “Sudarshan Chakra,” is a cornerstone of India’s air defence, capable of engaging multiple aerial threats at ranges up to 400 kilometres. Pakistan’s state media, including PTV and the Associated Press of Pakistan, hailed the strike as a significant blow, with China’s Global Times amplifying the claim. Pakistani security sources further alleged the attack targeted BrahMos missile storage and airfields, showcasing technical superiority. India categorically denied these claims, labelling them a “malicious misinformation campaign” orchestrated by Pakistani state agencies. Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, in a press briefing, stated that the S-400 systems successfully neutralised Pakistani drones and missiles on May 7–8, with no evidence of damage in Adampur. India’s Press Information Bureau released time-stamped images of undamaged airbases to counter related claims, dismissing social media posts as “fake”. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of exaggerating its achievements to bolster domestic morale, noting the S-400’s operational success in intercepting attacks. [Kashmir Isn’t The Only Flashpoint — Hindutva Is Much Bigger Threat](https://thefridaytimes.com/21-May-2025/kashmir-isn-t-the-only-flashpoint-hindutva-is-much-bigger-threat) The controversy underscores the challenges of verifying claims in a conflict marked by restricted access and rampant disinformation. X posts reflected polarised sentiments, with Pakistani users celebrating the alleged strike and Indian sources dismissing it as propaganda lacking credible evidence. Without independent satellite imagery or on-ground assessments, the truth remains obscured, eroding trust and complicating ceasefire efforts. This episode highlights the critical need for neutral verification mechanisms to counter state-backed narratives. **Perspectives from Chinese State Media** China, Pakistan’s principal defence partner, used state-run outlets like China Daily and Global Times to signal its strategic priorities: supporting Islamabad while advocating regional stability to protect the $30–40 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Lou Chunhao of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, writing in China Daily, framed Pakistan’s May 10 counterstrikes as a “calibrated act of deterrence” in response to India’s escalation, urging both nations to consider the “nuclear backdrop”. This reflects Beijing’s strategy of backing Pakistan as a counterweight to India while avoiding actions that could destabilise CPEC. Global Times editorials criticised India’s “aggressive posture” but warned that prolonged hostilities would impose “mutual costs outweighing tactical gains”. The outlet praised Pakistan’s restraint and highlighted its J-10C capabilities, reinforcing China’s military partnership with Islamabad, which includes supplying 36 J-10C fighters. Simultaneously, it called for de-escalation to prevent the involvement of external powers, revealing China’s delicate balancing act: supporting Pakistan militarily while urging restraint to maintain regional stability. **Pakistan’s Aircraft Capabilities: The J-10 Factor** [South Asia's Endless War: India, Pakistan, and the Road to Nowhere \\| Missed Shots & Muddled Futures](https://thefridaytimes.com/03-Jun-2025/south-asia-s-endless-war-india-pakistan-and-the-road-to-nowhere-missed-shots-muddled-futures) Pakistan’s deployment of Chinese-supplied J-10C fighters on May 10 marked a significant shift in South Asia’s aerial power dynamics. These 4.5-generation multirole fighters, equipped with active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and PL-15 beyond-visual-range missiles, penetrated Indian air defences to target strategic airbases in Udhampur and Pathankot. The J-10C’s advanced avionics, digital fuzing, and stealth features place it on par with India’s Rafale jets, challenging India’s traditional air superiority. Pakistan’s Ministry of Defence confirmed the use of “advanced fighters,” aligning with third-party reports. By 2025, Pakistan had acquired 36 J-10Cs, significantly enhancing its qualitative edge. Chinese logistical support, including spares and training, has ensured high sortie rates, bolstering Pakistan’s sustained combat capabilities. China supplied 80% of Pakistan’s arms between 2020 and 2024, cementing a robust military partnership that has shifted the regional balance. India’s air defences, with only 24% of systems meeting contemporary standards, were exposed as outdated, prompting calls for urgent modernisation. **India’s Budgetary and Capability Response** India’s response to the 2025 conflict reflects a determination to restore strategic superiority, though a manpower-heavy defence budget limits flexibility. The FY 2025–26 defence budget stands at ₹6.81 trillion ($78.7 billion), a 9.5% increase, but 69% is allocated to personnel costs, leaving just 31% for capital modernisation (SIPRI, 2025). This imbalance constrains investments in advanced systems needed to counter Pakistan’s J-10C capabilities and address vulnerabilities exposed during the crisis. India’s military spending in 2024 ($86.1 billion) dwarfs Pakistan’s ($10.2 billion), supporting a larger force: 4,614 tanks, 1,338 aircraft, and 9,243 artillery systems compared to Pakistan’s smaller arsenal. However, Pakistan’s qualitative gains in air power have narrowed the gap. India is fast-tracking upgrades, including 26 additional Rafale jets, Su-30MKI enhancements, and deployment of S-400 and Akash-NG air defence systems. The Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS) is being expanded to reduce sensor-to-shooter time, while mobile repair units and forward depots aim to enhance operational resilience. Nevertheless, India’s structural reliance on personnel costs poses a long-term challenge to maintaining a technological edge. [Iran-Israel Conflict: How It’s Reshaping South Asia \\| India, Pakistan, and the New Cold War](https://thefridaytimes.com/02-Jul-2025/iran-israel-conflict-how-it-s-reshaping-south-asia-india-pakistan-and-the-new-cold-war) **Pakistan’s Defence Policy: Economic Constraints and Scenarios** Pakistan’s defence posture is shaped by severe economic constraints, with a 2024 defence budget of $10.2 billion compared to India’s $86.1 billion. With debt at 70% of GDP and IMF-imposed austerity measures, Islamabad faces trade-offs between defence, debt servicing, and social programs. The J-10C’s operational cost ($20,000 per flight hour) limits expansion, forcing Pakistan to prioritise maintenance and training over new acquisitions (RAND Corporation). Pakistan relies heavily on Chinese support, which accounted for 80% of its arms imports between 2020 and 2024. From T-59 tanks to co-developing the JF-17 and supplying 36 J-10Cs, China’s role is pivotal. The $40 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor further deepens this partnership, with potential for subsidised arms transfers and technical assistance, though China’s slowing 4.8% growth may limit aid. Saudi Arabia, which provided $6 billion in bailouts in 2018–2019, may offer $2–3 billion in financial or defence support, but its Vision 2030 priorities constrain deeper engagement. Pakistan is investing in asymmetric tools—CH-4 drones, stand-off weapons, and cyber capabilities—to raise India’s costs at low investment. Its nuclear deterrent, costing $1–2 billion annually, remains central to strategic balance, ensuring survivability against conventional threats. Covert support for insurgents in Kashmir may persist, though international scrutiny limits its scope. Pakistan’s approach will remain defensive, focusing on J-10C readiness and selective LoC engagements to preserve deterrence without provoking escalation. **India’s Strategic Response: Arms Race, Kashmir Militarisation, or Revanche?** The 2025 crisis exposed vulnerabilities in India’s air defences, raising questions about its strategic response. Historical patterns following the 1999 Kargil conflict and 2008 Mumbai attacks suggest India will pursue targeted enhancements rather than sweeping changes. [Beijing’s Big Game:How China Is Taking Over South & West Asia\\| India Is Pushing Back](https://thefridaytimes.com/02-Jul-2025/beijing-s-big-game-how-china-is-taking-over-south-west-asia-india-is-pushing-back) India’s $86.1 billion defence budget significantly outpaces Pakistan’s, but 69% allocation to personnel costs and competing domestic priorities (e.g., infrastructure, healthcare) limit an all-out arms race. India is prioritising selective upgrades: additional Rafale jets, S-400 deployments, and IACCS expansion to counter threats from Pakistan and China. These measures aim to restore deterrence without destabilising India’s economic growth, projected at 6.5% for 2025. Further militarisation of Kashmir is unlikely, as India already deploys 500,000 troops in the region. Additional forces offer diminishing returns and risk international criticism over human rights, especially after the 2019 revocation of Article 370. Instead, India is likely to enhance surveillance, including drones and satellite monitoring, to tighten control. A revanche-style offensive is improbable due to nuclear risks, with a potential exchange estimated to cause up to 125 million deaths (Science Advances, 2019). India’s restrained response after the 2019 Balakot strike and its reliance on diplomatic levers—such as trade pressure and Quad partnerships with the US, Japan, and Australia—suggest a preference for calibrated actions. India’s modernisation will focus on smarter investments, leveraging Russian and US platforms to strengthen deterrence while avoiding unsustainable escalation. **Conclusion** The 2025 conflict underscores the enduring role of nuclear deterrence, breakthroughs in military technology, and stark fiscal asymmetries. Pakistan’s J-10 fighters exploited gaps in India’s air defences and drew US diplomatic intervention. India has allocated a $86 billion defence budget focused on modernisation, while Pakistan’s comparatively modest $10.2 billion program remains heavily dependent on Chinese support. Pakistan and India’s current ceasefire is exceedingly fragile, with neither side willing to show flexibility; repeated violations and a swirl of disinformation continue to erode what little trust exists. Looking ahead, India is likely to deepen its investments in modernisation, surveillance capabilities, and diplomatic outreach, carefully calibrated to avoid escalation given its nuclear arsenal and economic constraints. Pakistan, for its part, intends to maintain its J-10 squadrons and asymmetric warfare tools, bolstered by ongoing assistance from China and Saudi Arabia. Ultimately, only sustained, US-facilitated dialogue on the Kashmir dispute can hope to avert a catastrophic wider conflict.

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with “unspecified casualties” on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi’s China and Modi’s India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China’s ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China’s abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India’s protest in denying Beijing’s claims as “exaggerated and untenable” is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi’s “clarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat”_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India’s active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China’s nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India’s nuclear strike range_** **_(right) – estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India’s national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China’s “containment of India,” the modernization of the PLA and its “growing assertiveness on the border”, and recommended a shift of India’s national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China’s unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or “string of pearls” that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India’s security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India’s peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China’s energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China’s power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China’s “Malacca dilemma,” by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing’s interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of “the quad”, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing’s ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India’s nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India’s boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India’s dismay. When BRI’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India’s doctrine of “strategic autonomy”. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek “equivalence” with the great powers — China, Russia, US — in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi’s party and support the base’s nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem “techno-nationalism”.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India’s dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India’s military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China’s relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. Commensurate to China’s 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a “peaceful rise” of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world’s longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India’s options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India’s strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India’s preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India’s “Neighborhood First” policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi’s ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal’s stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the “Asian Century” may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India’s geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide “chicken’s neck” connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China’s favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi’s strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India’s advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ”partners” with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh’s deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China’s border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its “like-minded partners” in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India’s diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war – for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India’s irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China’s assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-à-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, “wolf-warrior diplomacy”, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India – the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its “NORMS — New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System” approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India’s quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact – an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China – to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia – India’s soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter’s unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese “iron brother”, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China’s increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India’s disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled. In the _Art of War_, Sun Tzu posits, “a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.”\\[31\\] In their international positioning, whether it will be India or China’s thinking and preparedness that is victorious, only the real geopolitical battle will tell — one that far exceeds the LAC battlegrounds. * * * **References** [_**\\[1\\]**_](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/india-china-standoff-from-precarious-peace-to-the-point-of-no-return/?srsltid=AfmBOorD5qivlKr2EDLlPurrKrB1Tr759R_oZtMzJq_UPkH-xwZw139I#_ednref1) _Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas, New Delhi, November 29, 1996, United Nations Peacemaker, available from_( [https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%20IN\\_961129\\_Agreement%20between%20China%20and%20India.pdf](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%2520IN_961129_Agreement%2520between%2520China%2520and%2520India.pdf)).

    "full_text": "In the wake of Pahalgam, Indian policymakers face a difficult but necessary recalibration. The April 2025 Pahalgam terrorist attack marks a significant moment in South Asia’s evolving security matrix. While the India–Pakistan binary continues to dominate discourse, China’s ambiguous posture following India’s Operation Sindoor warrants deeper scrutiny. This issue brief assesses Beijing’s silence, the implications for China-India ties, and China’s alignment with Pakistan’s strategic calculus. Drawing on past crises like Pulwama, Balakot, and Uri, it interrogates China’s selective neutrality, its shielding of Pakistan, and the erosion of its credibility as a regional stabilizer. By weaving in Chinese media narratives and official statements, the analysis critically evaluates whether Beijing is prepared—or even interested—in playing a constructive role in South Asian stability. The brief concludes that unless India recalibrates its strategic assumptions and narrative posture, China will continue to manipulate the region’s instability through plausible deniability and transactional diplomacy. The terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22, 2025,1 which killed 25 Indians and 1 Nepali and injured dozens more, is the latest chapter in South Asia’s long-running saga of cross-border militancy. Yet it would be a mistake to frame it solely within the India–Pakistan binary. As India launched Operation Sindoor in response— targeting terrorist infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC)—the silence and subsequent posture of China signaled deeper tremors in the broader regional architecture. Kashmir has long served as a crucible of IndiaPakistan hostility, but the Pahalgam attack— attributed to the Pakistan-backed group The Resistance Front (TRF),2 which is a front for the UN-proscribed Pakistani terrorist group, Lashkar-e-Taiba—has unfolded in a regional context far more complex than previous crises. India’s swift military response via Operation Sindoor, while reminiscent of the 2019 Balakot precedent, came in a more layered geopolitical moment, where any Indian action reverberates beyond Islamabad to Beijing. Despite issuing a generic statement of terming India’s Operation Sindoor “regrettable,”3 Beijing offered no commentary on the Pakistan-backed terror attack itself. By sidestepping the central provocation—the targeting of Indian civilians by a known Pakistani terror outfit—China has raised fundamental questions about the strategic calculus guiding its relations with both Islamabad and New Delhi. Keep Reading The brains behind Matavire’s immortalisation Zim’s poor batting hands India series Proposed raids on grain farmers raises stink Red Cross work remembered New Delhi’s official narrative continued to underscore its commitment post Operation Sindoor to “commitment to non-escalation, provided it is respected by the Pakistan military”.4 However, during May 8-9, Pakistan responded with a drone offensive targeting Indian military sites,5 prompting countermeasures. By May 10, Pakistan had a name for its retaliatory escalation: Operation Bunyan Marsoos,6 which came to an abrupt halt when a ceasefire was agreed upon between India and Pakistan later in the day.7 Despite ceasefire violations by Pakistan in the immediate aftermath of the announcement, the agreement seems to be holding currently. Yet what stood out amid this tit-for-tat dynamic was China’s conspicuous silence and strategic responses. Post Pakistan’s escalation on May 9, the topic of India-Pakistan conflict was completely absent from the pre-approved questions of the regular press briefing by the Chinese Ministry.8 Even in response to the news of the ceasefire, China’s statement has been guarded, stating it hopes India and Pakistan will “consolidate and extend” the same.9 As China distances itself from India’s narrative but attempts to show semblances of neutrality, it raises doubts over the credibility of Sino-Indian normalization. While the two countries may engage in tactical military disengagements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Pahalgam episode demonstrates that deep strategic distrust remains. India’s engagement with counterterrorism in the region has often required it to navigate a diplomatic minefield, particularly when the international community does not uniformly support its security concerns. The post-Balakot moment saw similar divisions, with China refusing to back India’s actions at multilateral fora while amplifying Pakistan’s grievances. Such flashpoints, unpacked later in this brief, underscore a consistent Chinese pattern—a trend that has deepened in the aftermath of Pahalgam. What differentiates this latest incident, however, is the broader geopolitical backdrop. The Pahalgam incident hence emerges as a compelling prism through which to examine the strategic entanglements involving China in South Asian geopolitics. China’s posture following Operation Sindoor calls to question its regional credibility10 and the future of the still recovering India-China bilateral post the 2020 Galwan clash. In essence, the Pahalgam incident is a microcosm through which to assess whether Beijing is capable of playing a stabilizing role in South Asia or if it remains tethered to old geopolitical loyalties that undermine its normative credibility.11 China’s Calculated Ambiguity and Strategic Hedging At first glance, China’s reaction to the Pahalgam attack appeared predictably neutral,12 reiterating a standard line against terrorism in all forms albeit without naming Pakistan-based groups, which then evolved into calling for an “impartial probe” into the attack.13 Beijing’s ambiguous position is hardly new. It has long shielded Pakistan from international pressure on terrorism-related matters. In 2023, for instance, China blocked a UN Security Council listing of Sajid Mir—a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander with ties to the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.14 Such acts are not isolated; they are part of a broader calculus in which Pakistan is Beijing’s irreplaceable partner in South Asia. This alignment is driven by both geopolitical and geo-economic considerations. Pakistan is China’s all-weather partner (全天候伙伴关系 or quántiānhòu huǒbàn guānxì),15 crucial not just for counterbalancing India but also for securing the western front of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). CPEC is a flagship component of BRI and runs through an unstable Gilgit-Baltistan and, despite India’s vehement opposition, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Stability in these zones is key to China’s western frontier strategy, giving it a vested interest in maintaining the status quo—even if that includes cross-border terrorism targeting India. Further compounding the issue is the unspoken quid pro quo between Beijing and Islamabad: Pakistan remains silent on China’s domestic repression of Uyghurs,16 while China refrains from condemning Pakistani-linked Islamist militant groups. This transactional compact allows both states to shield each other on their respective internal and external security issues, forming a mutually reinforcing axis of silence. In times of crisis, this axis manifests through diplomatic choreography. For example, during the Galwan Valley clashes in 2020, Pakistan was among the few countries to openly17 support China’s position, even as the rest of the world urged de-escalation.18 Conversely, during moments of India-Pakistan tension, Beijing reliably leans toward a neutral but structurally pro-Pakistan position. During the 2016 Uri attack, Beijing maintained a studied silence while subtly encouraging bilateral restraint. In 2019, when India moved to revoke Article 370 granting Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, China supported Pakistan’s “legitimate rights and interests” in Kashmir.19 Furthermore, post the 2019 Pulwama attack, China refused to list Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad chief as a global terrorist under UNSC Resolution 1267.20 This narrative strategy appears to serve a dual function: first, to construct a regional imaginary in which India is framed as a destabilizing actor across multiple contested peripheries; and second, to subtly align with Pakistan’s security perceptions without overt endorsement as seen during Balakot as well with Chinese state media closely relaying Pakistan’s perspectives.21 Such framing enables Beijing to reinforce an adversarial posture vis-à-vis India while maintaining formal neutrality. More critically, it delegitimizes India’s counterterrorism imperatives by projecting them as part of a broader pattern of assertiveness rather than as legitimate responses to asymmetric threats. The aftermath of Pahalgam has reinforced this pattern. Structural Limits of Sino-Indian Normalization –and the idea of China as a stabilizer Although India and China have made some progress in military disengagement following the 2020 Galwan Valley clash and the October 2024 border agreement, the Pahalgam episode reveals the limitations of this tactical thaw. China’s refusal to acknowledge Pakistani provocations— or even address the cross-border violence in its Operation Sindoor press briefings—shows that Beijing’s strategic alignment with Pakistan remains intact. This persistent ambiguity damages the credibility of any “reset” in India-China relations. It also underscores a recurring pattern in Chinese state discourse, where India’s actions across both the LoC and Line of Actual Control (LAC) are presented as signs of regional destabilization.22 The result is a rhetorical sleight of hand: India’s counterterrorism efforts are rebranded as adventurism, while China claims neutrality. India for its part has walked a delicate line on China’s own internal security policies.23 India’s cautious approach is also seen on the Uyghur issue, where it has stopped short of criticizing China. India’s intent is to prevent further escalation with China, particularly amid the tensions along the Himalayan border.24 Ironically, this caution has earned India neither Chinese neutrality on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism nor any softening of China’s positions on Kashmir. India must prepare for the possibility of a more overt China-Pakistan strategic alignment in the Himalayan theatre—as seen briefly with the short-lived Himalayan Quad.25 A major point of pride in Chinese social media and state-media news circulating currently is the alleged downing of Indian aircrafts, “three Rafale f ighter jets, one MIG-29 fighter aircraft, one Su30 fighter jet, and one Heron drone”26 by the Pakistani air force. India has not confirmed these losses. China has emerged as Pakistan’s principal defense partner, supplying approximately 81 percent of its arms imports between 2020 and 2024.27 This strategic partnership was evident during the recent military exchanges with India, where Pakistan deployed Chinese-made J-10C f ighter jets and PL-15 air-to-air missiles.28 The J-10C, a 4.5-generation aircraft equipped with advanced avionics and radar systems, played a pivotal role in Pakistan’s aerial defense, which the Chinese social media is celebrating in disc. China’s support extends to artillery systems, such as the SH-15 155mm truck-mounted howitzer, and advanced radar installations along the LoC.29 China’s participation in February 2025 in Pakistan’s multinational naval exercise AMAN further consolidates the partnership’s expansion into the Indian Ocean.30 This deepening military collaboration underscores China’s commitment to bolstering Pakistan’s defense capabilities, thereby influencing the strategic balance in South Asia. Concurrently, on May 9, as Pakistan responded to Operation Sindoor,31 China conducted a live-fire military exercise in Tibet involving truck-mounted artillery and long-range rockets. Although conducted within Chinese territory, the exercise’s temporal proximity to the crisis raised red flags within Indian security circles. Of particular concern was increased PLA logistical activity along the G219 highway—an artery critical for mobilization across Tibet and Xinjiang. Such maneuvers are not incidental; rather, they reflect deliberate strategic signaling. Given the history of the China-India border standoff from April 2020 to October 2024, this latest development underscores Beijing’s continued use of military exercises as coercive diplomacy (胁迫性外交 xiébò xìng wàijiāo). The drill’s timing suggests that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is not merely observing the India-Pakistan escalation, but actively inserting pressure on India’s northern front to exploit its two-front dilemma. At the same time, China’s approach to international order is selective. It supports rules when they are advantageous and obstructs them when they threaten. This raises an important question for policymakers: can Beijing ever be a partner in building a rule-based regional order when its strategic habits are so conditional? The Pahalgam silence is not simply an oversight; it reflects a broader unwillingness by China to apply consistent normative standards when its interests are at stake. India, therefore, faces not just a tactical silence, but a strategic contradiction—one that complicates regional security architecture. This difference also further highlights China’s inability to be a stabilizing regional actor or mediator—a niche it is building for itself in West Asia—in South Asia owing to its national interest driven biased approach to regional conflicts.32 China increasingly brands itself as a mediator in global hotspots—from IranSaudi rapprochement to ceasefire proposals in Ukraine. Yet in South Asia, this “stabilizer” identity appears performative. Its refusal to challenge Pakistan undercuts its credibility as a neutral actor. The narrative of “community of shared future” (人类命运共同体 rénlèi mìngyùn gòngtóngtǐ) rings hollow when Beijing prioritizes geopolitical returns over regional peace. In this regard, it is also critical to note that India’s claim to great power status hinges not only on its material capabilities but also on its willingness to shape global norms on terrorism. To do so, a post-Pahalgam India may need to deepen its engagement with global norm entrepreneurs—from middle powers in Europe and Asia to civil society actors and multilateral institutions. Additionally, it must better leverage its leadership in forums like the G20 and BRICS to reframe regional security debates. If China wishes to be seen as a responsible stakeholder, it must be challenged to behave like one. In forums like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which have been focused on regional non-traditional security, China’s bias becomes more evident—obstructing Indian efforts to spotlight Pakistan’s terror links33 while promoting counterterrorism cooperation that suits its agenda.34 The SCO’s regional antiterrorism structure (RATS) has increasingly focused on threats aligned with Beijing’s internal definitions, particularly extremism related to Xinjiang, while sidelining India’s concerns about transnational Islamist militancy based in Pakistan. However, Beijing’s notion of “Asia for Asians” appears hypocritical when it shelters Pakistan but obstructs regional counterterrorism consensus—especially in RATS under the SCO umbrella. Beyond multilateral diplomacy, China’s reluctance to endorse Indian perspectives has extended to informal channels. While India and Pakistan engage in kinetic and symbolic war over territory and identity, China operates in the background as both facilitator and firewall for Pakistan. Backchannel discussions have repeatedly seen Chinese interlocutors urge restraint on both India and Pakistan—without distinguishing between a state defending its civilians and one enabling non-state actors. This false equivalence erodes India’s trust and limits the scope for genuine regional cooperation. From Response to Strategy: How Should India Read into Beijing’s Silence? India’s recent history is littered with crises where tactical victories often came at the cost of longterm ambiguity. In the aftermath of the 1999 Kargil War, for instance, India successfully reestablished control over its territory but failed to push for international accountability on Pakistan.35 Similarly, the 2017 Doklam standoff with China ended with a disengagement, but left the broader strategic questions unresolved. Even the 2020 Galwan clashes, despite their tragic costs, did not lead to sustained support or narrative building. What unites these episodes is a recurring pattern: India seeks resolution through calibrated responses while both adversaries exploit the absence of sustained international pressure. The Pahalgam attack threatens to repeat that pattern unless India broadens the strategic scope of its response—not merely in military terms but in diplomatic signaling, normative positioning, and alliance formation. India’s challenge is not just the asymmetry of violence with Pakistan—it is the asymmetry of narrative and support in multilateral spaces. Despite India’s restraint on Chinese internal matters, such as its silence on Xinjiang in UN forums, China has shown no reciprocal flexibility on Kashmir or Pakistan-based terrorism. This lack of strategic reciprocity is widening the gap between tactical cooperation and strategic mistrust. It also casts doubt on China’s repeated offers to play the role of a regional stabilizer. Beijing is unlikely to act as an honest broker in India-Pakistan disputes because it is structurally invested in Pakistan’s strategic and territorial claims, especially those in Kashmir. Moreover, the geo-economic dimension complicates the landscape further. China’s massive infrastructure projects through Pakistan-administered territories give it a direct stake in the political and security status quo in Kashmir. Any Indian attempt to assert sovereignty over the entire region threatens not just Pakistan’s territorial claims but China’s physical investments. It is for this reason that Chinese diplomats have avoided endorsing even moderate Indian positions on Kashmir. Even in backchannel diplomacy, Chinese officials urge restraint from both sides but refrain from applying pressure on Pakistan to dismantle terrorist networks—a selective neutrality that undermines India’s trust in Beijing’s intentions. Going forward, Indian policymakers may consider more assertive linkages between China’s Kashmir positions and India’s stance on Tibet and Xinjiang. While such rhetorical escalation risks deepening the rift, it may serve as a deterrent to Beijing’s selective neutrality. More broadly, India must prepare for a strategic environment in which a China–Pakistan alignment in the Himalayas becomes less tactical and more entrenched. If China continues to describe Jammu &amp; Kashmir as “disputed territory,” Indian policymakers may feel justified in elevating the discourse on Chinese internal colonialism in places like Tibet and Xinjiang.36 While such a shift would risk further alienation, it could also serve as a deterrent against China’s one-sided narratives in multilateral spaces. Forecasting China’s future position on Jammu and Kashmir suggests continuity rather than change. As long as CPEC remains central to China’s regional vision, Beijing will oppose any Indian attempt to alter the territorial status quo in ways that threaten Pakistan’s legal or strategic control over its administered areas. Even if the Pahalgam incident spurs limited backchannel diplomacy, it is unlikely to alter China’s fundamental incentives in the region. The question, then, is whether the Pahalgam attack has merely revealed existing patterns in China’s South Asia policy or whether it marks a turning point. In one sense, it reaffirms an uncomfortable reality: Beijing’s anti-terrorism policy is primarily inward-looking and defined by the logic of state sovereignty, not regional peacebuilding. Terrorism that originates in Xinjiang is treated as an existential threat to the Chinese state, meriting mass surveillance, reeducation camps, and transnational intelligence cooperation. But terrorism that originates in Pakistan and targets India is diplomatically bracketed, treated as either a bilateral problem between New Delhi and Islamabad or, more insidiously, as a counterweight to Indian assertiveness. In the wake of Pahalgam, Indian policymakers face a difficult but necessary recalibration. While India has long pursued strategic autonomy, this doctrine cannot translate into strategic silence in the face of double standards. New Delhi must continue to assert its case in global forums— not only in terms of territorial integrity but also normative consistency. A longer-term Indian strategy may also involve diversifying its diplomatic partnerships in ways that offset Chinese influence. This includes expanding cooperation with regional and extra-regional actors who share India’s concerns about crossborder terrorism and authoritarian influence in multilateral institutions. The elevation of minilateral forums such as the Quad and closer coordination with Europe and Southeast Asian partners could enable India to construct new coalitions that constrain Chinese room for maneuverability as Beijing’s current incentives give it little reason to alter course. As long as CPEC remains a geostrategic and economic priority, and Pakistan serves as both a buffer and a partner, China will continue to downplay Islamabad’s transgressions. Any backchannel diplomacy following Pahalgam is unlikely to produce meaningful rebalancing unless India reshapes the cost-benefit calculations driving China’s current Sout ​ h Asia posture. The Pahalgam terrorist attack is not merely an India-Pakistan crisis. It is a regional flashpoint that pulls China out of the shadows and into the foreground of South Asian security dynamics. Beijing’s silence—strategic, deliberate, and revealing—shows that China is not yet ready to play the role of a stabilizing power in the region. Instead, it continues to hedge its bets, uphold transactional alliances, and avoid normative positions on terrorism that might alienate Pakistan. For India, the path forward involves more than military preparedness. It demands a recalibration of strategic assumptions about China’s role in regional crises. The Pahalgam attack may not shift China’s behavior immediately, but it sharpens the contours of a regional order where Beijing is less bystander and more stakeholder— one whose interests often run counter to India’s pursuit of stability and security. In this landscape, India must think beyond Pakistan and confront the deeper structural dynamics of the Pakistan-China bonhomie. Related Topics",

It continues to be so.”_– Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.\\[i\\] _From Ideology To Warfare_ The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. _Resurgence_ Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. ### A New Strategy _“We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.”_-Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. _Overruns_ On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • **Used improvised explosive devices.** Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • **Assassinated officials.** In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • **Destroyed police infrastructure.** Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj _Systems Disruption_ At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? ### The Deviant Economic Engine _“The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.”_-Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. _The Revolutionary Tax_ In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. _A Revolutionary Tax Economy_ To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • **Mining.** Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • **Narcotics.** India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • **Informal tolls.** Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. ### A Strategic Half-Life _“It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they_ _look to the Naxals for justice.”_–Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future. _Sources:_ i Mahendra Kumawat, “Naxal Movement Has Shown Tremendous Grit,” Rediff News, April 9, 2010. ii Waquar Ahmed, Amitabh Kundu, and Richard Peet, India’s New Economic Policy: A Critical Analysis (New York: Routledge, 2011). iii Bibhudatta Pradhan and Santosh Kumar, “Pillai to End Maoist Grip on $80 Billion Investments,” Bloomberg Businessweek, September 17, 2010. iv Government of India, “Fact Sheet On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),” Ministry of Commerce and Industry, February 11, 2011, http://dipp.nic.in/fdi\\_statistics/india\\_FDI\\_February2011.pdf (accessed March 23, 2011). v Rahul Nilakantan and Saurabh Singhal, “The Economic Costs Of Naxalite Violence and the Economic Benefits of a Unique Robust Security Response,” 2010. http://www.aae.wisc.edu/mwiedc/papers/2011/Singhal\\_Saurabh.pdf (accessed April 3, 2011). vi “Chhattisgarh’s Entire Forest Area A Minefield?,” Times of India, May 10, 2010. vii Manoj Prasad, “Former Jharkhand CM Marandi on Their Hitlist, Naxals Kill Son, 17 More,” Indian Express, October 28, 2007. viii Press Trust of India, “Maoists Storm Jehanabad Jail,” Rediff News, November 14, 2005. ix Sudheer Pal Singh, “Illegal Mining May Impede Divestment in Coal India,” Business Standard, August 21, 2010. x Government of India, “Loss of Coal Production in Naxalite Areas,” Press Information Bureau, August 4, 2010, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=64116 (accessed January 4, 2011). xi “Chronology of Naxal Attacks on Trains,” India Today, May 28, 2010. xii Law Kumar Mishra, “Maoists Blow Up Track on Gaya-Dhanbad Section, Rail Traffic Disrupted,” Times of India, September 13, 2010. xiii “Naxal Attacks Doubled in 2009, Rlys Lost Rs 500cr: Mamata,” Times of India, April 23, 2010. xiv Manoj Prasad, “Naxal Attacks, Escalated Cost Derail Jharkhand Railway Projects,” India Express, April 12, 2010. xv Ishita Ayan Dutt, “Naxal Hits to Pull NMDC Net Down by Rs 1,000 cr,” Business Standard, April 20, 2010. xvi “NMDC to Lay 12 mt Pipeline on Highways to Avoid Naxal Attacks,” The Financial Express, July 20, 2010. xvii “Naxals Obstruct Road Works,” The Hindu, May 9, 2011. xviii Dutt. xix Sandeep Joshi, “550 More Mobile Towers to Boost Fight Against Naxalites,” The Hindu, June 30, 2010. xx “World Bank Approves $1.5 billion for India’s Rural Roads Scheme,” Press Trust of India, December 22, 2010. xxi Prassana Mohanty, “Maoists’ Financing – The Blood Flows as Long as the Cash Flows,” Governance Now, April 7, 2010. xxii Mohanty xxiii Sujeet Kumar, “Maoists extort Rs 300 Crore Annually in Chhattisgarh,” The Economic Times, July 5, 2009. xxiv Bharti Jain, “Rs 150 Crore: Maoists Extortion Amount From Chhattisgarh SSIs,” The EconomicTimes, April 10, 2010. xxv Ajit Kumar Singh and Sachin Bansidhar Diwan, “Red Money,” Outlook India, April 5, 2010. xxvi Ministry of Home Affairs, 2010-2011 Annual Report (Delhi: Government of India, 2011). xxvii Shaikh Azizur Rahman, “India’s Illegal Coal Mines Turn Into Death Pits,” The WashingtonTimes, November 24, 2006. xxviii Prasoon Majumdar, “Our Own Banana Republics!” Indian Institute of Planning andManagement, August 26, 2010, http://prasoonmajumdar.blogspot.com/2010/08/our-own-banana- republics.html (accessed April 29, 2011). xxix United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, “India is a Major Drug Hub: US,” September, 2007, http://www.unodc.org/india/en/rajiv\\_quoted\\_et.html (accessed February 25, 2011).

Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations. #### 2\\. Act normal If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour. #### 3\\. Remove traces of your submission If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used. In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media. If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion. #### 4\\.

Full Text Basic Political Developments Congress not worried by Anna's threats of fast, says Digvijaya Press Trust of India, Updated: November 02, 2011 17:22 IST http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/congress-not-worried-by-anna-s-threats-of-fast-says-digvijaya-146234 Rampur (Uttar Pradesh): A day after Anna Hazare threatened to launch another hunger strike if a strong Jan Lokpal Bill was not passed in the Parliament's Winter Session, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh today said his party is not afraid of the Gandhian's threats. \"Congress is neither bothered, nor afraid of Anna's threat to resume his fast on the last day of Parliament's Winter Session if the government fails to get a strong Jan Lokpal Bill passed by then,\" he said at a religious function in Sambhal town of Moradabad district, around 70 km from here. Digvijaya said Team Anna's claim that they have the support of over one crore people on the Jan Lokpal Bill issue is \"unfounded, hollow and fictitious\". Replying to a query on 'gupt daan' (secret donations) to the NGO, India Against Corruption, run by Arvind Kejriwal during Anna's hunger strike in Delhi, Singh said sarcastically, \"Na khata na bahi, jo Kejriwal kahe wahi sahi (There is no account book. Whatever Kejriwal says, is correct and unquestionable).\" CBI summons Jagan for questioning in alleged mining scam http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/andhra-pradesh/article2591464.ece CBI has called Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, son of former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, for questioning on November 4 in connection with alleged multi-crore iron ore mining scam. The agency is probing an alleged nexus between Mr. Jagan and Janardhana Reddy whose company Obulapuram Mining Company (OMC) has been accused of violating mining norms in the Ananthpuram district of Andhra Pradesh, CBI sources said. The clearance for mining leases to OMC was given during the tenure of Rajasekhara Reddy as Chief Minister. CBI has recently questioned the then cabinet colleagues of the late Rajasekhara Reddy in connection with the mining scam as it found that mining leases for OMC were cleared in an unusual haste, they said. Kadapa MP Jagan is also facing allegations of amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income as well as alleged dilution of stake of Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructural Corporation (APIIC) which is having a joint venture with Emaar for the development of township on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The sources said CBI has called Mr. Jagan for questioning in connection with these allegations on November 4 at the Hyderabad office of the agency. Chidambaram appeals for peace in Manipur PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2591394.ece Chidambaram appeals to Manipur groups to withdraw blockade Manipur: SHDC withdraws blockade Nagas call for three-day total blockade NIA will not oppose bail of Malegaon accused: Chidambaram 48-hour bandh in hill districts of Manipur from Monday Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram, who arrived in Imphal on Wednesday on a two-day visit to Manipur, toured Naga-dominated interior Senapati hill district and appealed to people to settle all issues through dialogue. Inaugurating a mini-secretariat building at Senapati district headquarters, Mr. Chidambaram said all efforts would be made to bring peace, harmony and development in the state. On October 31, Sadar Hills District Demand Committee SHDDC, which had launched economic blockades on Imphal-Dimapur -- Guwahati (NH-39) and Imphal-Jiribam-Silchar (NH-53), called off the 92-day strike after the state government assured them that their demands would be looked into. The SHDDC was demanding conversion of Kuki-dominated Sadar Hills area into Naga-majority Senapati district, Official said Mr. Chidambaram preferred to visit the interior hill district because both Nagas and Kukis there were well disposed towards the demand of the SHDDC for conversion of the Sadar Hills area into a full-fledged revenue district. Mr. Chidambaram would visit various parts of the interior hill district during his two-day visit. The minister after spending about one hour in the district visited another Naga-dominated district Ukhrul, bordering Myanmar, where he inaugurated a SDO office. Officials said he would hold a meeting with Chief Minister O Ibobi Singh to take stock of the law and order situation in Manipur. Meanwhile, the United Naga Council said it will continue its economic blockade on the two national highways on Manipur side and called a three-day bandh from midnight on Thursday to protest against the government's assurance of turning Sadar Hills area in Senapati district into a separate district. An UNC spokesman said the bandh will be supported by All Naga Students Association Manipur. He said the ongoing economic blockade on the Manipur parts of the NH 39 and NH 53 which the group had launched on August 21 would continue. He said the bandh would cover all Naga-settled areas in Manipur. Reveal names of black money account holders: Advani to govt. PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2591671.ece BJP leader L.K. Advani today asked the government to make public names of those who have stashed black money abroad and sought their immediate prosecution. \"Without any further delay prosecution must be initiated and appropriate follow up action taken,\" Mr. Advani said referring to the people whose names have been provided to India by various foreign governments in this regard. \"Already there is a talk about three MPs having been identified, and the Government of France has given India a list of names of those possessing illegal wealth in Swiss and other foreign banks. The country eagerly expects their names to be made public. The UPA government will try to evade the issue once again, as has been its dismal record,\" he told reporters here. Mr. Advani said the Directorate of criminal investigation of Income Tax department had sent notices to persons involved in black money cases following scrutiny of classified banking data received from foreign countries about Swiss bank accounts. \"This is an issue on which there should be no hush hush...All information with the government on money stashed away abroad should be shared,\" he demanded. The BJP leader said, \"I have repeatedly asked for a White Paper on the issue of black money giving facts, giving names and above all giving details of all the steps taken by the government to get back this money which legitimately belongs to India. I believe that it cannot be allowed to be kept in foreign banks.\" Mr. Advani said that the American think tank \\`Global Financial Integrity' had estimated the amount of Indian black money in foreign banks at around Rs. 25 lakh crores. \"It is a staggering amount,\" he said, adding that this money should be used for the development of rural India. Government unveils bill for time-bound public services http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/government-unveils-bill-for-time-bound-public-services/articleshow/10582090.cms NEW DELHI: The government Wednesday unveiled a bill that seeks to get committed standards of public service and redressal of grievances in a stipulated time frame. The Citizens Right to Grievance Redress Bill, 2011 will look at complaints of violation of the citizens' charter to be formulated by each government department, identify liabilities of public servants in case of default and impose penalities for failure to deliver services or redress grievances in a time-bound manner. Speaking about the bill, the Minister of State for Personnel V. Narayanasamy said its architechture will ensure an appropriate decentralised and citizen-friendly mechanism to redress public grievances. \"The citizen's charter will have to be defined by the authorities at various levels, including panchayats, municipalities, states and the centre. For every authority, there will be a Grievance Redress Officer,\" Narayanasamy told mediapersons at a joint briefing with Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh. He said the bill will be put up on the website of the department of personnel for 21 days for people to give their comments. \"We will like to introduce it (the bill) in the winter session (of parliament Nov 22-Dec 21) after cabinet approval,\" he said. Narayanasamy said the bill can be enacted as a central legislation under the concurrent list and cover central schemes and central government departments. It will provide a platform to states to make a grievance redressal mechanism for state schemes and departments. Ramesh said the bill was another landmark in the \"rights-based approach followed\" by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. \"It (the) bill gives people legal entitlement,\" he said. Parallel trial cannot take place outside courts: Salman Khurshid Published: Wednesday, Nov 2, 2011, 17:32 IST http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report\\_parallel-trial-cannot-take-place-outside-courts-salman-khurshid\\_1606519 Taking exception to BJP leader LK Advani seeking answers on the PMO's role in the 2G issue, Law Minister Salman Khurshid today said as the case was already before the courts, a \"parallel trial\" cannot take place outside. \"A parallel trial cannot go on outside the courts... There is a basic thing that I want Mr Advani to know, that there is a principle of sub judice that you cannot discuss what's happening in the court,\" he told reporters here. He said if things which are before the court are discussed outside, \"there is a danger that you will influence what the courts will do.\" Khurshid was reacting to Advani's comment that if the PMO felt that then Finance Minister P Chidambaram had not taken timely measures to prevent 2G scam, the Prime Minister should have permitted a probe against him. \"It was incumbent upon the Prime Minister to permit investigation into his(Chidambaram's) role instead of expressing confidence in him saying he is innocent.\" National Economic Trends India ranked 134th in terms of Human Development Index Press Trust of India, Updated: November 02, 2011 18:45 IST http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/india-ranked-134th-in-terms-of-human-development-index-146261 New Delhi: A United Nations study has ranked India at 134 out of 187 countries in terms of Human Development Index even as it has observed that life expectancy at birth in the country has increased by 10.1 per cent a year over the last two decades. In the 2010 Human Development Report, prepared by UNDP, India had been ranked at 119 out of 169 countries. But the new report for 2011 says it is misleading to compare values and rankings with those of previously published reports, because the underlying data and methods have changed, as well as the number of countries included in the Human Development Index. The report said India's Human Development Index (HDI) value for 2011 was 0.547 positioning the country in the 'medium human development category'. Neighbouring Pakistan was ranked at 145 (0.504) and Bangladesh at 146 (0.500) respectively in terms of HDI. It said between 1980 and 2011, India's HDI value increased from 0.344 to 0.547, an increase of 59 per cent or an average annual increase of about 1.5 per cent. However, the report pointed that the country's HDI of 0.547 was below the average of 0.630 for countries in the medium human development group and below the average of 0.548 for countries in South Asia. The HDI is a measure for assessing long-term progress in three basic dimensions of human development such as a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living. The report said the \"mean\" year of schooling for the country increased by 3.9 years between 1980 and 2011 and expected years of schooling increased by 3.9 years. Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh, who was present at the report release function, however, sounded dismissive about the figures in the report. He said a better way of analysing the progress made by countries including India is to measure comparative success they have achieved on this count in the last few years from their previous record rather than by the number of their positions in the international chart. Ramesh said such presentation of human development indices is \"grossly misleading\" and the country's progress in this respect should be seen from a 20-year perspective. He said India has made huge strides in the field of education and water supply system but admitted that the biggest block in the human development indices for India is in the field of sanitation where 58 per cent of open defecation in the world takes place in India. He also rued that a mere expenditure of Rs. 2000 crore in the field of sanitation is being made while the budget for water supply was Rs. 20,000 crore. Ramesh said that the answer to the problem of sanitation is massive public investment in the sector on the lines of what the Central Government has done in education sector.

Gujarat NRE's Australian subsidiary owns and operates two hard coking coal mines in New South Wales (NSW) province of Australia. The company produces 1.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of coking coal and has plans to increase the quantum to 6 MTPA by 2015. Last month, Gujarat NRE Coking Coal Ltd, the Australian subsidiary of the Kolkata-based company, secured approval from the NSW Planning Assessment Commission for a USD 122 million upgrade of its infrastructure at the NRE-1 mine in Russel Vale, Australia. The approval will enable the company to continue to mine up to 1 MTPA of coking coal from the mine over the next three years. Company Executive Chairman Arun Kumar Jagatramka said, \"The grant of the (long-term loan) facility agreement on the back of the approval granted by the NSW Planning Assessment Commission represents another significant milestone for the company.\" Gujarat NRE Coke ( GNCL) had announced last month that by the end of the year, it will make public the USD 250 million new investment plan for the Russell Vale mine, which is estimated to hold 337 million tonnes of coking coal reserves. The proposal is part of GNCL's USD 486 million investment plan for its Australian assets, where it aims to increase total production to 6 MTPA by 2015. Shares of the company were being traded at Rs 24.75 apiece on the BSE at 1415 hours, up 1.02 per cent from their previous close.

Coal India Ltd gets Finance Ministry's nod for acquiring unlisted foreign companies http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/power/coal-india-ltd-gets-finance-ministrys-nod-for-acquiring-unlisted-foreign-companies/articleshow/10580433.cms KOLKATA: Mining company Coal India Ltd (CIL) has got the Finance Ministry's nod for acquiring stake in overseas unlisted firms. \"We have received Union Finance Ministry's clarifications sought for overseas acquisitions. The ministry permitted (us) to go ahead with acquisition of unlisted firms,\" CIL chairman N C Jha said on the sidelines of the company's Foundation Day celebrations attended by Coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal. However, the Finance Ministry has not given complete relaxation to the norm of minimum 12 per cent internal rate of return (IRR) from such acquisitions. \"The Finance Ministry has said we can go ahead with the proposals even if the return is below 12 per cent if they are for strategic reasons, but those has to be cleared by them,\" Jha said. He said CIL received proposals offering IRR between 9 and 12 per cent. The Finance Ministry will scrutinise the deals offering below 12 per cent IRR. CIL, the world's largest coal miner, failed to strike any deal due to procedural delays in approval by the government. It had sought relaxation in two parameters of overseas acquisition norms, which were allowing them to acquire stake in unlisted firms, including those offering below 12 per cent IRR. Jha said they would now pursue with some of the proposals lying before them. SAIL, Posco likely to have equal stake in joint venture Last updated on: November 02, 2011 17:20 IST http://www.rediff.com/business/report/sail-posco-likely-to-have-equal-stake-in-jv/20111102.htm An equal joint venture agreement between state-run SAIL \\[ Get Quote \\] and South Korean major Posco is likely to be inked during Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma's proposed visit to Korea starting November 5. The shareholding pattern of the proposed venture is seen as a hurdle in signing the pact. The proposed joint venture aims to set up a plant at an investment of Rs 16,000 crore (Rs 160 billion) in Bokaro to produce three million tonne auto-grade steel. \"We may have 51 per cent equity or it could be 50:50,\" Verma told reporters when asked about the likely shareholding pattern in the JV. A senior official in the ministry, however, said the two parties have nearly reached an understanding to make it an equal joint venture. Posco's patented Finex technology, which would be used in the proposed new plant, is not being used any company other than Posco. Finex is an environment-friendly iron-making process where iron ore fines are directly used. There is also the iron ore price issue which is yet to be resolved, Verma said, adding that if all the pending issues were not cleared within next two days, he might even cancel his tour. The official, however, ruled out cancellation of Minister's visit to Korea. Verma is slated to leave Korea for Russia \\[ Images \\] on November 9 and come back to India on November 12. In Russia, he will attend the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signing ceremony between state-run iron ore miner NMDC and Russia's Severstal. NMDC had earlier signed a pact with Severstal for setting up a three million tonne per annum steel plant, expandable to 5 mtpa, plant in Karnataka \\[ Images \\] entailing an investment of about Rs 25,000 crore (Rs 250 billion). Activity in the Oil and Gas sector (including regulatory) Have sought EGoM meet on diesel, LPG rate hike: Oil Minister http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/oil-gas/have-sought-egom-meet-on-diesel-lpg-rate-hike-oil-minister/articleshow/10580545.cms NEW DELHI With oil companies losing Rs 333 crore per day on selling fuel below cost, Petroleum Minister S Jaipal Reddy has sought a meeting of a high-powered ministerial panel to decide on revising the rates of diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene. \"I have asked for a meeting of the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM),\" Reddy told reporters after a meeting with Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who heads the EGoM. State-owned oil firms are currently losing Rs 9.27 per litre of diesel, Rs 26.94 per litre of kerosene sold through the public distribution system ( PDS) and Rs 260.50 per 14.2-kg LPG cylinder supplied to households for cooking purposes. The EGoM \"meeting would take place before the Winter Session of Parliament\", beginning November 22, he said, adding that a decision on raising prices may \"not be easy\". The ministerial panel is essentially a consensus-building body of the Congress-led UPA government and comprises key allies like the DMK, TMC and NC. The allies had in September scuttled plans to limit the supply of subsidised LPG cylinders to 4-6 per household in a year so that subsidies can be cut. Reddy said his ministry would push for raising prices of all three regulated products, diesel, LPG and kerosene. On oil companies pressing for a hike in petrol prices, he said PSUs were fully empowered to take a view, keeping in mind rising crude oil prices and depreciating rupee. \"Our ministry does not administer\" the price of petrol, which was freed from government control in June last year, he said. Yesterday, HPCL Director (Finance) B Mukherjee had said that oil firms may have to raise petrol prices, as they were losing Rs 1.50 per litre at the current rates. Hindustan Petroleum sells gasoline in rare tender http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/oil-gas/hindustan-petroleum-sells-gasoline-in-rare-tender/articleshow/10580752.cms SINGAPORE: India's Hindustan Petroleum Corp has sold a rare gasoline cargo through a tender, industry sources said on Wednesday. The refiner sold 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes of 90 RON gasoline for Nov 25-27 loading to Vitol at a discount of $1.75 per barrel to Singapore quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, they said. It is unusual for the Indian state-owned refiner to export gasoline as it is usually a net importer of the product, sources in India said. The cargo was said to be not compatible with the domestic Indian specifications as its sulphur content was too high, they said. \"It's only a one time cargo, public sector units or state refiners don't ever sell gasoline unless it's off-specs, which cannot be sold in the domestic market, so this cargo didn't match the Euro III standards,\" said one of the sources. The sale of the cargo was due to a domestic surplus of the product, a second source said. Vitol is likely to use the cargo for blending purposes, they said. But this could not be verified. GAIL (India) earmarks $400 mn for Singapore LNG trading business in 2012 http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/oil-gas/gail-india-earmarks-400-mn-for-singapore-lng-trading-business-in-2012/articleshow/10580127.cms SINGAPORE: Gail (India) Ltd has earmarked USD 400 million for its new Singapore trading office to secure LNG and petrochemical product cargoes for delivery to India in 2012, Chairman and Managing Director B C Tripathi announced in Singapore today. Gail's Singapore office, which was inaugurated today but will begin trading next month on getting all formal approvals, will tie-up as much as USD 400 million worth of LNG cargoes and petrochemical products next year for delivery into India, he said after addressing a press conference. Ninety per cent of the trade would be in LNG from the initial start-up. \"India is a huge market for LNG and petrochemical products, while supply remains tight,\" stressed Tripathi, reaffirming Gail's commitment to energy development both within India and globally through an annual investment of USD 2 billion. He also disclosed that Gail was building shale gas expertise through participation in projects in the United States. \"The company is building expertise in shale gas and will participate in the Indian shale gas projects once the government announces its policy and development plans,\" he said. He said participation in US shale gas was a part of Gail's strategy to develop technology, expertise and know-how. Gail, along with its international partners in existing projects, will aggressively bid for shale gas concessions in India once the government puts them up for auction, which is expected to take place in about one year. Oil companies can decide on petrol price hike: Petroleum Ministry PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2591304.ece A day after State-owned oil companies pressed for a petrol price hike, the Petroleum Ministry today said it is up to the oil firms to decide on raising the rates of the deregulated commodity. \"It is for them (oil companies) to decide. They will take a decision at a right time,\" Oil Secretary G.C. Chaturvedi told reporters here. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) Director (Finance) B. Mukherjee had said on Tuesday that oil firms may have to raise petrol prices, as they were losing Rs. 1.50 per litre at the current rates. Mr. Chaturvedi said petrol is a deregulated commodity whose pricing is not decided by the government. \"The oil companies are empowered to take a view on it,\" he said. Indian Oil, HPCL and Bharat Petroleum had last hiked petrol prices by Rs. 3.14 a litre on September 16, when the Indian rupee was valued at about Rs. 48 per U.S. dollar. The exchange rate is now over Rs. 49 per U.S. dollar. \"From today, there are some losses on petrol. To cover them, we may have to increase prices,\" Mr. Mukherjee had said on Tuesday. He had stated that crude oil is hovering at around $108 per barrel in international markets. At the current exchange rate, the petrol price of Rs. 66.84 per litre in Delhi is equivalent to a crude oil price of about $102 per barrel. The government had in June last year deregulated, or freed, petrol from all price controls, but the retail rates have not moved in line with the cost as high inflation forced the oil companies to seek \"advice\" from the parent Oil Ministry before revising rates. Mr. Mukherjee did not say when petrol prices would be hiked. \"We are in consultations,\" he said, without elaborating. The loss on petrol is currently Rs. 1.50 per litre and after including local levies, the desired increase in retail prices is Rs. 1.82 per litre. \"Let's say, we are toying with the idea,\" he said. \"It may happen. We will see,\" he added. Besides petrol, the three firms are losing Rs. 333 crore per day on selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene below cost. They lose Rs. 9.27 per litre on diesel, Rs. 26.94 per litre on kerosene sold through the public distribution system (PDS) and Rs. 260.50 per 14.2-kg LPG cylinder supplied to domestic households for cooking purposes. At the current rate, the industry is projected to lose Rs. 121,459 crore in revenue on the sale of diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene in the full fiscal. While the loss on these three products is compensated through a combination of government cash subsidy and upstream oil firm dole-outs, there exists no such mechanism for making good the losses on petrol, as the product is deregulated Militant Activity/Terrorism (Particularly in Bangalore, Mumbai, Noida, Chennai, Coimbatore) All 15 kidnapped by Maoists in Bihar traceless PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2591362.ece The 15 people abducted by Maoists in Bihar's Jamui district on Monday are yet to be traced even as securitymen intensified operations to rescue them. \"There is still no trace of the kidnapped persons. The security personnel have intensified the operations to free them from the clutches of the Maoists,\" Jamui Superintendent of Police R N Singh said. Maoists kidnapped the 15 - eight labourers, four employees of a private construction company and three villagers - from Balthar Ghat. Late on Monday night, over 50 ultras stormed into the office of a private firm engaged by Bihar State Bridge Corporation for construction of a bridge over Bharnar River and took them away at gun point to a forest bordering Giridih district of Jharkhand. Ulfa hardliners warn of fresh attacks http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Ulfa-hardliners-warn-of-fresh-attacks/articleshow/10578603.cms GUWAHATI: After opposing the ongoing peace process and stating that the political conflict between India and Assam could only be resolved by holding discussions on \"sovereignty\", Ulfa hardliners on Tuesday issued a fresh warning of launching attacks on government transport, politicians, black marketers and corrupt officials. In an email sent by Arunodoy Dohotia, the chief of Ulfa's publicity wing, the hardliners asked the public to maintain safe distance from people belonging to any of the above mentioned categories. \"We want to alert everyone to keep away from government transport, vehicles of corrupt politicians and companies utilizing the resources of the state improperly, black marketeers and corrupt officials to avoid any kind of action,\" said Dohotia in the email. Meanwhile, the split between Ulfa hardliners and Arabinda Rajkhowa-led pro-talks faction has once again come to the fore with both sides involved in a mudslinging on the topic of \"sovereign Assam\". Another email sent by pro-talks Ulfa faction's publicity wing member Kamal Kachari rubbished the demand of \"sovereign\" Assam by saying that it has lost relevance in in today's time. \"The state is not asking for an armed movement. Paresh Baruah should not comment on the demand of Assam's sovereignty by staying at a distance. His demand has no relevance in today's time and is very immature,\" said Kachari. He added that the ongoing peace process will not be hampered by Paresh Baruh's personal statements. \"Though Baruah claims to represent the Assamese people, the commoners here don't want any more violence,\" he said in the email. On the other hand, pro-talks Ulfa leader Jiten Dutta was arrested for contempt of court on Tuesday. Dutta was held for not being present in the TADA court several times. He was taken to Guwahati Central Jail in the evening. Naxals gun-down villager on suspicion of being police informer http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/MP-RAI-naxals-gun-down-villager-on-suspicion-of-being-police-informer-2536070.html Raipur: A native of Aljam villge in Khadgaon, Rajanadgaon district, was shot dead by Naxalites on Monday night. The victim was dragged out of his house at night and tried in a Naxal \\`court' where he was found guilty of being a police informer. He was granted the death penalty and shot dead. Naxalites, who were reported to be around 40 in number, also asked all villagers to see the proceedings. More than 35 people have been shot dead in last 2-3 months by Naxalites for the same reason. Police say the act was to instill fear amongst villagers. Naxal activities have been on the rise in Rajanandgaon in recent times. In another brazen act seen recently, Naxalites entered an MLA's residence, snatched his gunner's weapon and escaped. Govt tightens railway security in Naxal areas http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/govt-tightens-railway-security-in-naxal-areas\\_739291.html New Delhi: The government on Tuesday decided to deploy additional forces to protect railway properties and tracks and install CCTV cameras at vulnerable stations located in Naxal-hit areas to check continuous attacks by extremists. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting, convened by Union Home Secretary R K Singh and attended by Railway Board Chairman Vinay Mittal and police chiefs of West Bengal, Orissa and Jharkhand. The meeting decided to augment the Railway Protection Force Personnel (RPF) in Maoist affected areas in coordination with State police forces to protect railway stations, tracks, godowns and intensify patrolling to ensure smooth running of trains, official sources said. Close Circuit Television Cameras will also be installed at vulnerable stations located in Naxal affected states to prevent extremist attacks. Dedicated officers will also be put in three designated places round the clock to coordinate security in railway properties, particularly on inter-state borders of West Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. Home Ministry officials are particularly concerned that Maoists have been attacking on goods trains loaded with coal and iron ore affecting industrial activities in different parts of the country as major coal and iron ores mines are located in these states. \"The meeting focused on systemic improvement of railway security,\" an official said. Currently, night running of trains has been suspended along two railway lines passing through the Naxal belt. There were 45 attacks on railway properties in 2010 and 23 this year till October 15. Labor/Social Unrest Pilots stir: Air India pilots move High Court http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/pilots-stir-air-india-pilots-move-high-court/articleshow/10575183.cms MUMBAI: A group representing a section of pilots of Air India has moved the Bombay High Court, challenging the management's decision to train pilots of the carrier's domestic operations in flying the latest Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft. In its petition, the Indian Pilots' Guild (IPG) has alleged discrimination on part of the management at the national carrier in giving opportunities for career progression to the pilots of the erstwhile Indian Airlines. Despite the merger of the two state-owned carriers in 2007, issues of integration of pilots remain to be resolved at the cash-strapped airline. The matter, which will come up for hearing on November 2, will most likely be disposed the same day as training for batches of pilots is scheduled to commence the next day. On Tuesday, Air India's international operations suffered due to crew crunch as 23 IPG pilots reported sick. The pilots met the management, but the meeting did not resolve the crisis. The airline, in a statement, however said the pilots will not be going on strike and that operations will be normal. The IPG, which represents about 250 pilots from the airline's international operations, had written to Rohit Nandan, chairman and managing director on October 29, seeking a no-objection certificate for about 100 pilots so that they can find jobs elsewhere. \"We feel cheated by management's unfair and discriminatory decisions leading to a complete stall of our career progression,\" the letter said. Before the merger, Indian Airlines was to get 15 A330 wide body aircraft. \"But since it was decided that the two airlines will be merged, the deal to get the 15 A330s was done away with,\" said a senior commander who is currently flying A320s. \"We were made to understand that since Air India will get the Dreamliners (787s) there was enough scope for us to progress to wide body aircraft.\" The IPG and the pilots union of the erstwhile Indian Airlines, or the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), had agreed to send 16 sets of pilots each for training for the 787, at a meeting with the management two months ago. In December 2010, the then Air India chief Arvind Jadhav had allotted 40 slots of Boeing 787 to the Air India narrow body pilots, a move opposed by the IPG in a letter dated February 15, as an illegal and arbitrary order. The IPG alleges that the management's move to allow ICPA pilots to fly wide body aircraft is a violation of Air India Pilots' wage document and deed of recognition. Senior pilots in Air India say that pilots of ICPA who are flying narrow body aircraft are allowed to fly aircraft on Alliance Air (its domestic regional subsidiary) and they should do so as it flies narrow body aircraft fleet instead of eating into IPG's pie. The ICPA also claims that the commanders of Air India that are supposed to fly the 787 have much less number of flying hours. -- Anya Alfano Briefer STRATFOR T: 1.415.404.7344 \\| M: 221.77.816.4937 www.STRATFOR.com",

but based on military-level \"understandings\". - **LoC and IB - Distinct legal interpretations:** - **LoC (de facto border between India and Pakistan):** Approx. 740 km, from Sangam in Kashmir to Point NJ-9842 near the Siachen Glacier. - **IB:** - **In Jammu**, the LoC changes into the IB for India, since it has no territorial claims on Pakistani Punjab on the other side. - But for Pakistan, the IB is a “ **Working Boundary**”, since it claims Jammu on the Indian side - and hence deems the border unsettled. - **Operational dynamics:** - **Heavy troop presence** with fortified structures on both sides. - **Seasonal terrain shifts** affect actual positions. - **Mandate** is to prevent infiltration and unilateral changes. - However, there has been a **rise in infiltration** and Pakistan Border Action Teams (BAT) raids since **1989**. - **Ceasefire often violated** and restored informally - e.g., 2003, 2021. ## Nature of Ceasefire Violations - **Motivations behind violations:** - Typically **increase during every bilateral crisis** since 1972 to **impose military costs** on the other side. - Such violations have ranged from **limited small-arms fire** to full-fledged cross-border operations such as the **Indian surgical strikes** against terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan occupied Kashmir in 2016. - **\"Autonomous military factors\":** Local commanders act independently for boosting troop morale, revenge, testing enemy resolve. - **Absence of formal rules of engagement:** - **No strict protocols** prevent firing; governed by unwritten SOPs. - **Conflict resolution mechanisms:** - Flag meetings between local commanders. - Hotlines between DGMOs in New Delhi and Rawalpindi. - These reduce escalation but do not prevent future violations. ## Ceasefire Understanding of 2021 and Its Significance - **Strategic rationale behind 2021 understanding:** - **Pakistan:** Internal instability and Afghanistan border tensions. - **India:** Focus on China and the **Line of Actual Control** (LAC, Ladakh). - **Result:** Drop in violations, increased civilian safety, agriculture revival, and economic stability in border villages. - **Diplomatic and military communication:** - **Since the 2019** India-Pakistan diplomatic freeze, only military-level communication remains active. - **Weekly DGMO calls continue**; April 29 call saw India objecting to ongoing violations. ## Current Developments and Strategic Outlook - **Cross-border dynamics post-Pahalgam attack:** - Firing possibly used by Pakistan to maintain military pressure and leverage. - India needs to: - Retaliate (militarily) to the Pakistani violations. - Resolve BSF jawan detention issue (crossed IB accidentally on April 23). - During times of crisis, such accidental crossings act as leverage for one side over the other. - **Risks of escalation:** - Ceasefire violations are low-intensity yet high-risk events. - Often the first and most controlled military response in crisis. - However, **risk of rapid escalation remains**, especially **under public or political pressure.** ## Conclusion - **Ceasefire** at the LoC remains an evolving military understanding, **prone to crises and local dynamics.** - Despite communication mechanisms, **long-term peace requires political will and strategic foresight.** ## LoC & Strategic Dynamics in India-Pakistan Relations FAQs **Q1.** Explain the significance of the 2021 India-Pakistan DGMO understanding in the context of ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC). **Ans.** The 2021 DGMO understanding marked a significant de-escalation along the LoC, reducing ceasefire violations and allowing both countries to focus on internal and external strategic challenges, notably India’s LAC standoff with China. **Q2.** Differentiate between the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB) in the context of India-Pakistan boundary disputes. **Ans.** The LoC is a military control line demarcated post-1972 Simla Agreement without legal international status, while the IB is a settled international boundary recognized by India but termed a \"Working Boundary\" by Pakistan. **Q3.** Discuss the role of ‘Autonomous Military Factors’ in ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border. **Ans.** Autonomous Military Factors refer to localized military decisions, such as testing enemy positions or boosting troop morale, which often trigger ceasefire violations independent of political directives. **Q4.** What mechanisms exist to manage ceasefire violations between India and Pakistan, and how effective are they? **Ans.** Mechanisms like flag meetings and the DGMO hotline provide immediate conflict management tools, but they are not effective in preventing recurring violations. **Q5.** Assess the impact of ceasefire violations on civilian life in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir. **Ans.** Ceasefire violations disrupt civilian livelihoods through shelling-induced displacement, crop damage, and fatalities. **Source:** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-hot-loc-what-is-the-nature-of-india-pakistan-ceasefire-understanding-9979640/) * * * ​ ​ ​ Submit * * * ![logo](https://vajiramandravi.com/_next/static/media/badge_logo.5fb7c7f1.svg) © 2025 Vajiram & Ravi.

SHAH](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/kriti-m-shah) ##### [**Special Reports**](https://www.orfonline.org/content-type/special-reports) Published on **Apr 22, 2017**[PDF Download](https://www.orfonline.org/public/uploads/posts/pdf/20230722171059.pdf) # Dealing with violent civil protests in India - [Kriti M. Shah](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/kriti-m-shah) _The citizens’ right to protest is a pillar of Indian democracy. While citizens are allowed to peacefully assemble, however, protests and demonstrations sometimes take a violent turn; recent examples are the Jat protests in Haryana and the Kashmir unrest following the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, both in 2016. During such occasions, it is the prerogative of the Indian state to deal with the violent civil protests in a manner that ensures public order and protects citizens from harm. This paper discusses the use of force by security officials during periods of violent civil unrest and seeks to understand the ways and means of dealing with such protests in the country._ ## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

Disaster management emphasizes the need for incorporating multi-functional, multi-disciplinary and sectoral approach involving engineering, social and financial processes. Unfortunately, India does not have a good record on the front of disaster management. Natural disasters cannot be prevented from occurring. Because they are part of the natural environment in which we live. But what we can do, as far as possible, is to take precautionary measures at different levels of society to minimize the impact of these Natural Calamities on the people and their properties. Natural Calamities means a sudden occurrence causing extensive havoc – physical damage, loss of life and property. This situation is unfavourable to human, physical, environmental and social functioning; it causes human suffering, harm to property and environmental degradation on a massive scale. The incident often is more frightening than the capacity of the people living in the affected area to withstand it. ### **Types of Natural Disasters** - **Water and climate-related disasters**: Cyclone, whirlwind and storm, hailstones, cloud bursts, heat and cold waves, avalanches, drought, thunder and lightning. - **Land-related disasters**: Landslides, mud flows, earthquakes, dam failure, mine fire. ### **Natural Disasters Since old times** The worst storm in the old world had come in 1201 in Egypt. And Syria in which 10 million people were killed. In early 1556, 8.50 million persons were killed immediately in the earthquake in China. In India, the worst earthquake occurred in Calcutta in 1737 in which 3 million casualties were reported. The most earthquake-prone countries include Russia, China, Syria, Egypt, Iran, Japan, Java, Italy, Morocco, Turkey, Mexico, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Greece, Indonesia and Colombia. The Himalayan region is extremely sensitive to earthquake because the inner rocks of the Earth in this area are steadily shifting to the north. There are 10 dangerous volcanoes in the world which can destroy vast areas of the Earth. According to UN International Disaster Mitigation Strategy (UNISDR), India is second only to China in the case of Natural Calamities. In India, disasters determined mainly. The framework of geo-climatic conditions and their underlying weaknesses. Because of the intensity of these causes, various disasters keep recurring on a regular basis. In terms of effects and uncertainties, the frequency of climate-induced disasters, is the highest in the country. ### **Disaster-prone areas in India** Nearly 59 percent of the territory of India is prone to earthquakes. Himalayas and its surrounding area, the Northeast, the region of Gujarat and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are extremely seismically sensitive areas. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka and Bihar figure in top 10 states in terms of damage to human life, livestock, houses and damage to crops. In Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal cattle suffer the most in calamities. The highest damage to human life occurs in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka and West Bengal. Damage to houses and crops are also highest in these four states. The super cyclone in Odessa in 1999 and earthquake in Gujarat in 2001 were most destructive in terms of the severity of the damage in the last decade of the century. On December 26, 2004 earthquake struck in the coastal areas of India which created tsunami waves that caused extensive loss of life and property of high magnitude in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This was India’s experience of the tsunami disaster for the first time. ### **Recent Instances of Natural Disasters in India** - In 2005, flood shook the whole of Mumbai, India’s commercial capital. - Floods caused by inundation of river Kosi in Bihar in 2008, hundreds of villages were submerged. - Flood caused by cloudburst in Leh in Jammu and Kashmir in August 2010 killed nearly 113 people. - In 2004, Tsunami had shaken the Indian Ocean by a 9.3-magnitude earthquake - Cloudbursts in Uttarakhand in 2013 caused tragedy of unprecedented magnitude, resulting in the death of thousands of people. ### **Man-made causes of Calamities** Projects are going on indiscriminately in the name of development and urbanization. All this is causing unimaginable damage to the environment. The hills are damaged in the name of electricity, water, tourism and development. Deforestation is going on in plateau areas. Nature overexploited for extraction of minerals. Massive tree-cutting is going on in the plains. ### **Disaster Management in India** Disaster Management Bill approved. The Parliament on 28 November 2005 to combat calamities in the country. To reduce them and to rehabilitate the victims under a deprived institutional mechanism. It enacted into an Act on December 23, 2005. Under there is a provision to establish the National Management Authority headed by the Prime Minister, the State Disaster Management Authority headed by Chief Ministers, and District Disaster Management Authority under the Chairmanship of District Judges. It also has a provision to prepare National Disaster Management Plan by the concerned ministries and departments. It also seeks to form a National Disaster Response Force for emergency action the National Disaster Management Institute for training and capacity building. The Act also has the provision to constitute a National Disaster Response Fund and the National Disaster Mitigation Fund and similar funds at state and district levels. ## **Conclusion** Despite all these measures by the government, awareness is the first condition of effective disaster management and relief agencies should have immediate access to the affected region. If people do not have the awareness of the disaster, the terrible destruction poses a problem in relief. If possible, giving basic information to rescue people. In disaster areas can used to reduce. The damage caused by the disaster. The disaster management planning, proper communication, honest and effective leadership, coordination, etc are very important.

    "full_text": "Trudging through chest-deep water as he headed home in rain-maimed Mumbai last week, Vijay Mahajan didn’t miss the irony. As the chief executive officer of Bombay First, a city non-governmental organisation, he had brought in the multinational management consultancy firm, McKinsey and Co., to draft a vision report for Mumbai’s future development. But Mahajan, 55, spent the night of July 26 without food or water, trapped on a Bandra flyover girdled by a waterworld that stretched to his Borivili home. Not once during his walkathon did he spot a police officer, a fire officer, or a municipal worker. “Where was the government when Mumbai’s taxpayers had to go through this? Disaster management? It was a management disaster,” fumes Mahajan. The Orissa supercyclone of 1999 and the earthquake that convulsed Bhuj in 2001 might have served as wake-up calls for India to augment its disaster management plans, but as the events in Mumbai last week indicated, the metro had little else but plans. The central home ministry and states have penned sophisticated disaster mitigation, preparedness and response plans. But senior police and fire officers as well as disaster management advisors to the government told The Telegraph that India’s metros are far from ready to cope with natural or man-made disasters on a city-wide scale. “There’s visible lethargy,” says Dr Anand Arya, an earthquake engineer and seismic advisor to the home ministry at the Centre. A combination of climate and terrain, unplanned urban growth and high population density make India particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. Experts have estimated that some 60 per cent of the Indian landmass is prone to earthquakes, while 40 million hectares are susceptible to swollen rivers and floods, and nearly 70 per cent of India can face drought when rains fail. Cyclones pose a threat to millions of people living along India’s coastline, their habitations within walking distance of the sea. Lesson not learnt India has paid dearly for its natural disasters in the past. According to the government, in the 1990-2000 decade, disasters in India killed at least 40,000 and affected another 300 million people. Government officials say the Orissa supercyclone that killed nearly 10,000 people and the Bhuj earthquake that claimed 13,800 lives exposed major flaws in India’s traditional approach to coping with disasters. “Until then, our efforts had been relief-centric,” says Mohan Sajnani, advisor, disaster management, in the home ministry. “While relief and rehabilitation efforts after disasters were robust, little had been done for mitigation or preparedness,” Sajnani says. For hours after the Bhuj earthquake, for instance, no search and rescue teams that could clear collapsed debris and save the lives of trapped people were available. Disaster response teams that reached the site had little idea how to muster resources that were needed during relief and rehabilitation. There was an acute shortage of mobile medics. The home ministry has since then intensified efforts at enhancing disaster mitigation, preparedness and response. In a report presented last year on disaster management, it proposed an earthquake mitigation project and a 169-district disaster risk management programme. It is creating a cadre of trained experts to make up a National Disaster Response Force. It’s also developed a web-enabled resource inventory that rescue and relief teams would be able to use to find the nearest source of inflatable boats, cranes, hydraulic cutters, medicines and the myriad other items that they need during relief operations. But, some experts say, the slow implementation of plans has left cities and towns across India highly vulnerable. “There’s a lot of concern in the aftermath of an event, but then people forget and disaster preparedness is not an issue any more,” says Arya,who was former head of earthquake engineering at the University of Roorkee. Arya headed a team of experts who’ve come up with model building by-laws and rules to protect new constructions from earthquakes. The states were supposed to set up their own committees to incorporate these rules into their own building regulations but, Arya says, few states have done this. While the home ministry has proposed a Rs 1,132-crore project for retrofitting so-called ‘lifeline’ buildings ? hospitals, schools, telecommunication centres, water and power supply centres and airports and railway stations ? the actual cost of retrofitting ? making buildings safe ? across all cities would be much more than that estimate. “Still, the cost of protecting an existing building from earthquakes would be 10 per cent of the cost of constructing a new building today,' says Arya. The proposed disaster response force, drawn from the central paramilitary forces, will have search and rescue specialists, structural engineers, doctors, paramedics, and even sniffer dogs. In all, 144 specialist rescue teams, each with 45 members, will be stationed in disaster-prone zones in India by December 2006. Advisor Sajnani says 169 districts across India already have disaster management plans in place. “They’re not paper plans,” he asserts, and adds that some districts may be better prepared today than the metros. But apart from the costs of enabling India to cope with disasters ? which is expected to run into several thousand crores of rupees ? disaster plans may also face other obstacles. The level of preparedness is an issue that experts are particularly worried about, for the speed with which authorities react to a disaster depends on ground-level preparation. “Response movements should be near automatic once a disaster has occurred,” says Anand Patwardhan, head of the government’s Technology Information Forecasting Assessment and Research Council in New Delhi. Each person should know his or her exact role and action expected in response to a disaster. It’s possible only through repeated full-scale simulations and drills, Patwardhan says. Response teams, for instance, should know the location and distance to the nearest medical centres where victims need to be taken. Fist of fury: A house ruined by the Bhuj earthquake in 2001 Lack of resources The level of disaster preparedness varies across the metros, but police and fire officers in some cities concede that their preparedness is far from adequate mainly because of lack of equipment. Calcutta’s fire and emergency officials say they lack the equipment and infrastructure to counter a major disaster such as a high-magnitude earthquake or the levels of street flooding observed in Mumbai. Even the most basic equipment such as cranes are in short supply, officials say. The fire department sometimes uses equipment owned by private construction firms. When an auditorium in central Calcutta collapsed recently, city authorities had to move cranes from Kidderpore ? a dock area in south-west Calcutta ? to remove the debris. “Lives could have been saved if we had our own machines. It’s a shame that we don’t even have equipment to pull out dead bodies,” says fire and emergency services minister Pratim Chatterjee. “But whenever I point these things out, even my colleagues laugh at me. There is a complete lack of awareness.” The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has a disaster management group designed to handle normal emergencies. “But extraordinary disasters would be beyond our control,” admits mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya. While low-lying land area has increased four-fold in Calcutta, CMC still does not have a rubber boat for rescue operations. The city also lacks enough outlets for water to be channelled in case of a flood. Five years ago, when the streets were flooded due to incessant rains, the government was forced to use sophisticated pumps owned by the fire department and not intended for the purpose. As many as 22 pumps were damaged, none of which has been replaced yet. Calcutta is clearly not prepared to take on a calamity. Asked whether the city would be able to handle a Bhuj- or Mumbai-scale disaster, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee is non-committal. “It would not be proper to comment at the moment,” he says. But in Bangalore, Sunil Kumar, DIG of police and fire emergency services, is more open. He admits that a dedicated disaster management plan is not in place. He says there are 11 fire stations in Bangalore equipped with 35 vehicles and about 500 staff. “This is not sufficient, but we’re moving the government to augment the forces.” Kumar admits that the fire department is not equipped to handle flood calls. “And there are no training sessions targeted at preparing firemen for massive man-made or natural disasters.” India’s capital, however, appears to be better prepared with three disaster management centres for tackling city-wide emergencies. Each centre has a rescue response vehicle equipped with hydraulic tools for rescue operations, a hazardous material van to handle chemical crises and an ambulance, says New Delhi deputy fire chief A.K. Sharma. “We have a well-coordinated system for a state-wide emergency,” he says. “All fire and police stations and ambulance services can be activated for rescue and evacuation.” On the other hand, while New Delhi’s disaster teams have been in place for two years, there have been only four drills so far for fire, earthquake and chemical releases in the environment. Sharma also concedes that they are yet to organise a coordinated state-wide drill. “It’s going to take time, it’s not something we can do overnight,” says Sharma. City authorities plan to make the public aware of responding to disasters through awareness campaigns. “We’ve started teaching schoolchildren how to evacuate their classrooms,” Sharma says. What the home ministry is doing 1. Proposed an earthquake mitigation project and a 169-district disaster risk management programme. 2. Creating a cadre of trained experts to make up a National Disaster Response Force. Some 144 specialist rescue teams, each with 45 members, will be stationed in disaster-prone zones in India by December 2006. 3. Developed a web-enabled resource inventory that rescue and relief teams would be able to use to find the nearest source of inflatable boats, cranes, hydraulic cutters, medicines and so on for relief operations. Plans afoot But even well-laid plans can go awry. As they did in Mumbai last week. Mumbai has a 63-page document that identifies “problem areas” in each of the city’s wards and lays down procedures for risk assessment and response to disasters ranging from a cyclone to an earthquake to an epidemic. But as Mumbai’s disaster unfolded on July 26, triggered by an unprecedented 944 mm of rain, the city found itself locked in a mess before authorities could respond. The first distress call came at 4 pm when a school in the northern suburb of Dahisar called to say 1,200 children were marooned in the premises. By the time relief commissioner Krishna Vatsa realised what he was to tackle, traffic and the suburban railway network had stopped. “This wasn’t just a natural disaster, it was a man-made disaster,” says Dr C.J. Batliwala, honorary secretary, state chapter of the Indian Red Cross in Mumbai. “The disaster management plan was never activated. They have invested crores in disaster management, but (last week) it was a dead investment.” Batliwala says the government should have called in the defence forces that were trained to respond to emergencies faster than the state police or fire departments. Braveheart Sanjay Nigam, a 30-year-old painter, saved 150 lives by using a children’s swimming tube as an inflatable raft at the Air India colony in Kalina, a Mumbai suburb. “What took us six hours would have been such a swift operation for trained naval divers. It was appalling that here in Mumbai there were no choppers, no power boats, no rescue teams,” he says. At a high-level meeting in New Delhi in January this year, the government said it would set up a national disaster management authority with the Prime Minister as its chairman. The central government has also circulated a model for disaster management to all states. And the National Institute of Disaster Management, now operational in New Delhi, is involved in research, analysis and training of personnel. Things are clearly moving, but the worry is that the pace is too slow. Does India need another dose of disaster to accelerate its preparedness programmes?",

Several of these involved more than 1,000 MW losses in large renewable complexes, due to inadequate reactive support and fault ride failures. [SaurEnergy News Bureau](https://www.saurenergy.com/author/sponsored-feature) 18 Sep 2025 09:46 IST [Follow Us](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAiEP0Wo6yI9KdK0c3Y-1aUSvgqFAgKIhD9FqOsiPSnStHN2PtWlEr4/sections/CAQqKggAIhD9FqOsiPSnStHN2PtWlEr4KhQICiIQ_RajrIj0p0rRzdj7VpRK-DDz3MsL?ceid=IN:en&oc=3) After Iberian Blackout, India Stresses Timely Transmission Rollout for RE Evacuation Spain and Portugal’s April 2025 blackout, which cut 12,800 MW of power and left the Iberian grid disconnected from continental Europe, has prompted Powergrid to draw lessons for India’s rapidly expanding renewable-heavy system. With India already facing 68 renewable generation loss events in three years, officials warn that insufficient reactive power, inverter failures, and poor voltage control could trigger similar large-scale disturbances unless preventive measures are enforced. Advertisment On April 28, 2025, the [Spanish](https://www.saurenergy.com/solar-energy-news/spanish-grid-collapse-places-spotlight-on-grid-resilience-diversified-sourcing) and Portuguese electricity grids collapsed, causing a total voltage outage and disconnecting the region from the continental European grid. These lessons are particularly relevant for India, which is undergoing a transition toward higher shares of variable renewable energy (VRE). Due to this, Spain and Portugal faced public outrage, as the country reeled from low tolerance toward grid frequency disturbances. ## **The Incident** At the time, Spain and Portugal were experiencing low demand alongside very high renewable penetration—82% in Spain and 91% in Portugal. Voltage fluctuations, high voltages, and low-frequency oscillations led to a sudden voltage spike. This triggered large-scale generation disconnections, which in turn worsened the overvoltage situation and caused a blackout within 20 seconds. The outage also forced many conventional power plants offline due to both planned and unplanned shutdowns. According to Powergrid’s report, around 7,400 MW of gas and 3,000 MW of nuclear capacity went offline, taking the total outage to 12,800 MW. Advertisment ## **Factors Behind Grid Instability** Minutes of a [meeting](https://media.licdn.com/dms/document/media/v2/D561FAQGHfHA9kVBwnw/feedshare-document-pdf-analyzed/B56ZlHtshaHkAY-/0/1757844800292?e=1758758400&v=beta&t=MtbV6HoBbDJxxxqvM5jAh5ptlOjXgPtB7XTpGONAoVs) chaired by the Secretary (Power) on August 27, 2025, revealed that insufficient reactive power and voltage control, poor damping of oscillations, and cascade tripping due to overvoltage were the root causes of the blackout. Restoration was initiated through black starts at hydro and gas stations, supported by neighboring countries. Full restoration took around 19 hours. Sometime ago, India faced a similar situation. [Grid-India](https://www.saurenergy.com/search?title=+Grid-India+) noted that the Indian system has faced around 68 instances of renewable generation loss over the past three years. Several of these involved more than 1,000 MW losses in large renewable complexes, mainly due to inadequate reactive support and fault ride-through failures. Low-frequency oscillations triggered by controller interactions were also observed during high renewable generation periods. Reactive power support refers to the management and provision of reactive power to ensure the grid operates reliably and efficiently. This is typically achieved using devices like: - **Capacitor banks** – to supply reactive power - **Synchronous condensers** – to generate or absorb reactive power - **Static VAR compensators (SVCs)** – for dynamic voltage control Advertisment Grid-India noted that compliance efforts have already improved stability, reducing the frequency and magnitude of renewable tripping events. Highlighting some past experience, the report noted, \"Between January 2022 and June 2025, 68 major generation loss events were recorded. Of these, 41 occurred between January 2022 and December 2023, with the largest loss at 7,100 MW. Another 27 events occurred between January 2024 and June 2025, with the maximum loss at 4,930 MW,\" the report added. ## **Case Study: Bhadla, Rajasthan** The study noted one such major incident in Bhadla, Rajasthan, that caused widespread grid disturbance. Following an R-B phase fault on the 220 kV Bhadla–Clean Solar Power line, about 6,157 MW of generation was lost—5,807 MW from solar and 350 MW from wind. The fault caused a voltage dip at the 400 kV [Bhadla](https://www.saurenergy.com/search?title=Bhadla) substation, and most inverters failed to recover within one second. The subsequent reduction in generation offloaded the EHV network, leading to sustained overvoltage, further losses under high-voltage ride-through (HVRT) conditions, and tripping of multiple transmission lines. The frequency dropped by 0.7 Hz, triggering under-frequency load shedding of roughly 750 MW. Advertisment ## **Preventive Measures for India** To prevent similar conditions, a recent Ministry of Power (MoP) meeting concluded several key recommendations: - Stricter enforcement of VRE compliance verification at both ISTS and InSTS levels. - Periodic testing and tuning of controllers for all grid elements. - Timely commissioning of transmission systems for renewable evacuation. - Augmentation of intra-state transmission capacity. - Ensuring flexibility and adequacy of generation through the timely deployment of energy storage systems. The report added that India is working to address challenges associated with the large-scale integration of inverter-based resources such as renewables, [battery storage](https://www.saurenergy.com/search?title=battery+storage), electrolyzers, and data centers.

The most notorious civil struggle has been the conflict with Kashmir insurgents, a border conflict between India and Pakistan that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The group was inspired by the agrarian revolution ideology as a means to achieve equality. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. The Naxalites are considered far-left radical communists and are declared a terrorist group under Indian law. In this report we will look into the Maoist movement in India, starting with its history. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group’s success and the global geopolitical consequences. **[View the full report](https://www.confluenceinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/weekly_geopolitical_report_10_28_2013.pdf)** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors.

    "full_text": "(Illustration: Saurabh Singh) There are hard lessons for India as the West grapples with aggressive cyber espionage Certain expressions in global cybersecurity parlance have become ubiquitous lately, especially after the recent targeting of the American government and its core sectors by Chinese hackers. “Nation-state hackers” and “TTPs” (tactics, techniques, and procedures) are some of them. Worries about the scope of cyber espionage and the damage it can do are rising as some countries become more and more ambitious in stealing information apart from manipulating data and automated control to paralyse networks. Targets include energy grids, which European Parliament reports describe as an attack to “prevent users from using data or services”. This would mean power outages and massive chaos resulting in huge financial losses and equipment failures. Indian authorities know it only too well that American and European governments are not the only targets of nation-state hackers, cyber ninjas or groups acting at the behest of governments to snoop on other nations as part of new strategies to stay ahead of the spying game. After recent bouts of cyberattacks, multiple agencies in the West, including the US, came out with a joint statement, assessing that the extent of threat was higher than what was earlier perceived. Perkins Coie, which specialises in cybersecurity litigation besides other areas, says, “Multiple agencies of the US government and other governments have concluded that the cyber threat presented by the People’s Republic of China [PRC], specifically actors attributed to Salt Typhoon, is substantially greater than previously reported.” A joint statement by multiple agencies said that PRC’s state-sponsored cyber threat actors are targeting networks globally, including, but not limited to, telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging and military infrastructure networks. “While these actors focus on large backbone routers of major telecommunications providers, as well as provider edge and customer-edge routers, they also leverage compromised devices and trusted connections to pivot into other networks. These actors often modify routers to maintain persistent, long-term access to networks. This activity partially overlaps with cyber threat actor reporting by the cybersecurity industry—commonly referred to as Salt Typhoon, OPERATOR PANDA, RedMike, UNC5807 and GhostEmperor, among others.” In an op-ed for the Washington Post, Pamela K Isom of the American Security Project wrote that the Salt Typhoon attacks highlight the urgent need for systemic change in how telecommunications providers approach cybersecurity. “Government and industry leaders must be proactive and prioritise threat intelligence to improve defences before incidents occur. This requires proactive threat intelligence sharing. Encouraging an exchange between federal agencies and industry peers on actionable intelligence about emerging threats before incidents occur would help secure our country against state-sponsored hackers. Policymakers should establish programs that promote threat sharing and collaboration between the government and the private sector.” What are the lessons to learn from all this chaos in the West for India, a neighbour who has been the target of suspected Chinese-sponsored hackers for far too long? Amazon shut down its AI lab and several others scaled down operations in China, fearing espionage by targeting vulnerabilities in their systems to gain access to their networks After all, in the recent hacking spree, according to reports in Bloomberg and the Guardian quoting highly placed sources, the victims of the attack include the US agency charged with overseeing nuclear weapons, the National Nuclear Security Administration. Microsoft said it had observed three groups—the Chinese state-backed Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon, and Storm-2603, which is believed to be China-based—using “newly disclosed security vulnerabilities” to target internet-facing servers hosting the platform, according to a recent Guardian report, as updates from years-long attacks ferret out names of newer victims, taking the toll higher than earlier expected. It was therefore no coincidence that Amazon shut down its Shanghai AI research lab; McKinsey stopped taking up generative AI-related work amid geopolitical tensions in China, and several other companies scaled down operations in that country, fearing espionage by targeting vulnerabilities in the system to gain access to their networks. As stated earlier, TTPs are often talked about by analysts who are close to the matter and are looking at what went wrong in terms of cyber defence and offensive capabilities in their respective units. Tactics explains the “why” of a cyber-attack while techniques the “how”. Procedures are specific actions taken to implement techniques, or “what” the attack was at a granular level. Mumbai-based AI expert and cybercrime investigator Ritesh Bhatia, founder of V4WEB Cybersecurity, tells Open that the recent Chinese cyber intrusions into US security and political establishments highlight three hard lessons. “First, critical infrastructure and government networks will always be prime targets for nation-states and no sector is off-limits. Second, even highly resourced nations like the US can be compromised through supply-chain attacks and zero-day exploits, showing that perimeter defence alone is insufficient. Third, geopolitical rivalries are increasingly being fought in cyberspace, where attribution is murky and consequences are long-term.” He adds, “For affected countries, the key takeaway is to shift from a posture of defence to one of resilience that includes continuous monitoring, cyber-threat intelligence sharing, and building international coalitions to deter such actors.” Cyber experts have often talked about why countries fail to anticipate such attacks which, as of now, are synonymous with prolonged espionage. That also means access to personal data of each citizen of a country because of the heightened nature of connectivity and digitalisation. But not much headway has been made by individual countries, including India, which trains cyber commandos at a young age to boost its cyber-offensive capacities. Simply put, the threat of nation-state cyber criminals is on the rise and, in sharp contrast with traditional cyber attackers, their motives often border on warfare. A World Economic Forum report has underscored the challenges ahead: “The rise of generative AI has significantly increased the scale and sophistication of cybercrime, particularly identity theft and fraud. Global cybercrime is expected to cost $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion in 2015, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. To put it in perspective, if annual cybercrime were a country, it would have the third-largest gross domestic product [GDP] worldwide.” In the 2025 Armis Cyberwarfare Report, in which the firm surveyed more than 1,800 global IT decision-makers, a similar share (73 per cent) added that they feared that nation-state hackers’ AI capabilities could enable future sophisticated cyber attacks. Bhatia notes, “Most nations fail to anticipate vulnerabilities because of two reasons: complacency and complexity. Legacy systems, bureaucratic delays, and lack of proactive red-teaming leave blind spots. Unfortunately, it often takes a breach for leadership to realise that the weakest link in the chain can cause the biggest damage. Cyber resilience requires foresight, not hindsight.” He feels that India has made decent progress in cyber defence, with CERT-In, NCIIPC (National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre) and dedicated cyber command units working actively. However, in terms of offensive capabilities, countries like the US, China, Russia, and Israel are far ahead. India has the talent pool but what we need is sharper coordination, faster adoption of indigenous tools, government support and stronger private-public partnerships to scale our cyber power.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah unveils the logo of the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre, New Delhi, September 11, 2024 In fact, most countries, especially those with an edge in cyber capabilities, hire young people in order to combat threats and protect themselves by launching pre-emptive offensive attacks. Open had written about the Modi government’s plans earlier. While India has successfully withstood cyber attacks from Pakistan during and after Operation Sindoor, threats from elsewhere may not necessarily arise in the same way. Many sectors, including India’s education sector, are increasingly being targeted for cyber attacks, according to various reports. According to a report in The Hindu, organisations in India witnessed 3,237 cyber attacks per week on average in the month of August 2025 with education being the top target, followed by government and consumer goods and services segments, reported CheckPoint Research, the threat intelligence arm of Check Point, a Tel Aviv-based cyber security solutions firm. For his part, Bhatia agrees, “Cybersecurity is a young person’s game and their curiosity, adaptability, and raw coding skills matter as much as experience. Countries like Israel start spotting and training talent during high school, channelling them into elite units like Unit 8200. In India, we are slowly catching up through initiatives such as university-level ethical hacking competitions. But we need to institutionalise these efforts at scale, starting with school-level programmes, if we want to create a pipeline of cyber warriors for the future.” Meanwhile, a paper authored by Joe Devanny and Arthur PB Laudrain for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace outlines the opportunities and challenges for India on this front. “Given the strength of its digital economy and innovation, and its potential for further growth in connectivity, digital inclusion, and workforce development, India has considerable latent cyber power. There are, however, significant obstacles to converting latent into actual power—and indeed in orchestrating its effective use. Future developments should focus principally on investment in and improved coordination of domestic cybersecurity, resilience, and cyber defence.” The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) has acknowledged the need to groom cyber commandos, and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is working with the states to create special cells of such cyber warriors. Yet, considering the pace and extent of damage that nation-state cyber actors can cause, a swifter implementation of plans is in order.",

Admittedly, the AI bubble may pop before its large and ginormous energy demands really kick in. But (as occasional past posts help attest), the US grid was already in creaky shape. Trying to push more power through it without a major upgrade/redo is asking for serious trouble. The post below is a testament to the lack of leadership in the US. both the failure to question the necessity/desirability of testing the electric grid to (at least near) destruction, and deer-in-the-headlights quality of responses given that no effort seems to be underway to reduce AI demand (how about taxes?!?!). You’ll notice, in keeping, that this article takes the whistling-past-the-graveyard view that maybe this problem will sort itself out. _**By Robert Rapier, a chemical engineer in the energy industry. He has 25 years of international engineering experience in the chemical, oil and gas, and renewable energy industries, and holds several patents related to his work. Originally published at [OilPrice](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Americas-Grid-is-Nearing-Its-Breaking-Point.html)**_ - The US power grid is under significant stress due to rapidly increasing electricity demand from AI data centers and electric vehicles, coupled with the retirement of traditional power plants. - The grid faces mounting vulnerabilities from extreme weather events, cybersecurity threats, and physical sabotage, while policy gridlock and infrastructure delays hinder necessary upgrades. - Despite challenges, the situation presents investment opportunities in grid modernization, diversified generation, and solutions for energy storage and load management. America’s power grid is straining under the weight of a fast-changing energy landscape. Beyond the usual summer hum of air conditioners, power demand is surging from electric vehicle chargers and sprawling new data centers. At the same time, the infrastructure built to deliver reliable electricity is aging and showing its limits. From Texas heatwaves to California blackouts, the warning signs are impossible to ignore. This isn’t a technical challenge—it’s an economic and political reckoning. If the grid fails, it won’t be because we lacked solutions. It will be because we didn’t act quickly enough. **A Demand Surge Few Anticipated** For nearly two decades, U.S. electricity demand was flat. Now, consumption is climbing, driven by technologies that arrived faster than planners expected. Artificial intelligence has unleashed a wave of data center construction. These facilities, dense with high-performance servers and cooling systems, are among the most power-hungry assets in the country. In 2023, AI data centers consumed about [4.4% of U.S. electricity](https://iee.psu.edu/news/blog/why-ai-uses-so-much-energy-and-what-we-can-do-about-it), and that share could triple by 2028, according to Penn State’s Institute of Energy and the Environment. Northern Virginia—“Data Center Alley”— [now handles 70% of global internet traffic](https://oxfordamerican.org/oa-now/how-data-center-alley-is-changing-northern-virginia), pushing utilities like Dominion Energy to scramble for capacity. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google warn that a shortage of skilled electricians could delay expansion, with estimates that the U.S. will need [500,000 more electricians](https://www.ciphernews.com/hot-take/500000-electricians/) in the next decade. Electric vehicles, heat pumps, and electrified industry are adding further strain. The Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee projects growth [equivalent to seven Seattle-sized cities](https://www.nwcouncil.org/fs/18720/2024_05_3.pdf) within ten years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. electricity sales to rise from [4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/elec_coal_renew.php), with similar gains to follow. And finally, there’s climate. As extreme heat events multiply, cooling demand in places like Texas and Arizona is surging—driving peak loads to new records. **The Supply Gap: Retirements Outpace Replacement** Just as demand is accelerating, the U.S. is retiring some of its most dependable sources of power. [The EIA projects](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64604) 12.3 gigawatts (GW) of capacity will retire in 2025, a 65% jump over 2024. That includes 8.1 GW of coal, such as the 1,800-MW Intermountain Power Project in Utah, plus another 2.6 GW of natural gas. These plants provide round-the-clock power that intermittent sources cannot yet replace. Wind and solar capacity continue to grow, but not fast enough. The Department of Energy’s July 2025 [Resource Adequacy Report](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/DOE%20Final%20EO%20Report%20%28FINAL%20JULY%207%29_0.pdf) warns that only 22 GW of firm generation is expected by 2030—well short of the 104 GW needed for peak demand. Transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays, and slow adoption of long-duration storage compound the problem. Grid operators from PJM, MISO, ERCOT, and others [told Congress bluntly](https://www.powermag.com/nations-power-operators-warn-congress-of-a-coming-reliability-shortfall/) in March 2025: “Demand is accelerating, supply is lagging, and current tools may not be enough to bridge the gap.” **Growing Vulnerabilities: Weather, Cyber, and Sabotage** Beyond the supply-demand imbalance, the grid faces mounting risks. Heatwaves, wildfires, and storms are stressing transmission systems nationwide. Events once considered rare—like the 2003 Northeast blackout that hit 50 million people—are now seen as precursors of larger disruptions. As smart grids and distributed resources proliferate, so do digital entry points for hackers. In 2024, [DOE funded 16 cybersecurity projects](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/department-energy-awards-42-million-guard-power-grid-cyber-threats), including Georgia Tech’s AI-based “DerGuard” system to monitor risks in distributed energy. Sabotage at substations and transmission lines is also rising. With more than 160,000 miles of high-voltage lines and 7,300 plants, much of it decades old, the system is a sprawling, exposed target. [Homeland Security now classifies grid protection](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors) alongside nuclear and water infrastructure. **Policy Gridlock and Infrastructure Delays** Despite the alarms, policy responses remain sluggish. Jurisdiction is a big part of the problem. Regional transmission operators manage the grid but don’t own generation or lines. Utilities do, while states control siting and permitting. The result is a patchwork that slows progress. As of mid-2024, transmission projects across the U.S. [faced delays](https://www.wapa.gov/supply-chains/) of five to seven years due to permitting hurdles, interconnection bottlenecks, and supply chain constraints. By mid-2025, lead times for large power transformers had stretched beyond 30 months, with some units requiring up to four years for delivery—posing serious risks to grid reliability and expansion. Even bipartisan efforts like the [CIRCUIT Act](https://www.maddox.com/resources/articles/circuit-act)—introduced in February 2025 to incentivize domestic transformer production through a 10% tax credit—remain stalled in committee, despite widespread industry support and urgent supply chain concerns. Meanwhile, subsidies continue to favor intermittent renewables over firm capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act accelerated clean energy deployment, but without parallel investment in balancing technologies, reliability risks grow. **What’s Being Done** Federal and private efforts are ramping up, though often as short-term fixes. DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants and issued reliability directives under the Federal Power Act. These measures keep the lights on but do little to build long-term resilience. DOE also aims to increase long-distance capacity 16% by 2030, adding 7,500 miles of new lines. But permitting delays and local resistance remain obstacles. In 2025, [DOE launched $32 million](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/01/15/us-doe-invests-32-million-for-grid-edge-technology-and-smart-charge-management/) in pilot projects for smart EV charging, responsive buildings, and distributed energy integration. These solutions could eventually scale, but utilities and regulators must buy in. **Investor Implications: Reliability as a Premium** For investors, grid instability is a risk, but also an opportunity. Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion, and Avangrid are investing billions in grid modernization and diversified generation. Avangrid alone plans $20 billion through 2030 across 23 states. Independent power producers are also benefiting from the shifting landscape. NRG Energy, one of the nation’s largest competitive power suppliers, has seen its shares climb sharply as rising demand boosts wholesale electricity prices. Unlike regulated utilities, NRG and its peers compete in deregulated markets, where higher load growth and tighter capacity directly translate into stronger margins. That dynamic could make competitive generators an overlooked winner in a strained grid environment. Firms like Fluence, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are seeing growing demand for storage and microgrid solutions. Pilot programs backed by DOE may open new markets for software-driven load management. With coal exiting and renewables constrained, power generated by nuclear energy and natural gas retain a “reliability premium.” [Deloitte estimates](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/power-and-utilities/funding-growth-in-us-power-sector.html) the U.S. power sector will need $1.4 trillion in new capital between 2025 and 2030, with similar levels required through 2050. Firms able to supply firm generation or grid services stand to benefit. **Conclusion: Crisis or Course Correction?** The U.S. power grid isn’t collapsing—but it is under pressure like never before. Demand growth, baseload retirements, extreme weather, and policy paralysis are colliding to create a fragile system. Whether this moment becomes a crisis or a correction depends on how quickly policymakers, utilities, and investors adapt. The tools exist—firm generation, smart load management, and modern transmission. But without faster coordination and realistic incentives, the U.S. risks trading energy abundance for energy fragility. ## [Subscribe to Post Comments](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/09/americas-grid-is-nearing-its-breaking-point.html/feed) 20 comments 1. This is a messy article. Isn’t it?. Tries to pitch too many points without substantial information supporting much of it but lots of randomly scattered data. Few days ago I read there are now significant investments in new NG-based utility generation but this is omitted in the article. For what i have recently learnt, many and possibly the largest AI centres are relatively concentrated in hubs in Northern Virginia, Texas and few other places so if this creates constraints these are to be addressed in relatively few spots and the infrastructure being built will have little impact in the capacity of most of the grid. In contrast EV chargers and other electrification efforts is much more widely distributed and will require its own investments, specially in the distribution network. Addressing AI does not solve EV. In any case I very much agree that the grid would require centralised planning, tight coordination and a sea change in jurisdiction rules. [Reply](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/www.nakedcapitalism.com#comment-4281172) ↓ 1. Yes, its a messy article, and also ignores that the US is in reality three to four (depending on how you count) largely separate grids, with a number of sub-regional grids. As we’ve seen in Ukraine and Syria, even under extreme strain older grids don’t ‘collapse’, they have lots of inbuilt resilience – they become unstable and unreliable, but this is a gradual and unpredictable process. As I’ve stated before, I consider the impact of AI and data centres to be over-stated as a problem. If they cause overload in a local grid that’s not an infrastructural problem – its a contractual one. Most heavy commercial users will have outages built into the contract. Quite simply, if they demand more than the grid can supply, they get cut off, simple as that. This is why most of those centres have built in generating back up (which itself is an environmental problem, but a separate one). Its not absolute load demand that causes problems for grid, its how the peaks and troughs are managed. Grid management is an extremely complicated issue as it involves the interplay of supply, demand, economic costs, contractual and legal obligations, risk assessment, individual circuit engineering capacity, future projections of costs, demand with all the uncertainties involved, and so on. The US is facing a familiar problem of all mature economies in that it has developed a habit of free riding on past waves of development. The political glamour of upgrading and extending electricity supply has long gone and the requirements now are for boring incremental upgrades on long investment cycles, something politicians are notoriously loathe to spend any time thinking about. A key problem of course is that economic and technological changes impacting on grids often happen on a shorter cycle than grid planning and implementation. In reality, the engineering necessity is to significantly overbuild, and accept some level of wasted investment in order to have the necessary resilience. This is a hard sell when there are many other demands on investment. [Reply](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/www.nakedcapitalism.com#comment-4281185) ↓ 1. So far the most significant impact of AI is that it is driving up electricity bills specially in the non-industrial sector: commercial, residential etc. this, IMO, suggests that the regulatory framework and the pricing schemes should also be revised. The default approach in, as you say, mature economies leads to a few profiting while everyone else pays for it. It is also an indirect subsidy to those commercial projects. [Reply](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/www.nakedcapitalism.com#comment-4281198) ↓ 1. Messy is being generous. Another classic from oil price. Agreed that the market pricing structures need to be and I believe are starting to change. Just look at the pricing differences between co-ops and IOU’s. As to the power plant retirement plans , which many were put into place under the Biden administration under completely irrational reasons, most won’t happen. You can’t shut down a large % of power without first having their replacements on line. I mean you can but it’s going to set up big problems. And yes the country as has been explained didn’t really grow electricity from about 2000-2020. Some regional grids did see the change coming and moved forward with improvements. The more urbanized areas it’s much harder to install new powerlines and plants thinking PJM. As to transformers and gas turbines, and other grid components, they are available from China among other places at a much faster time frame than US suppliers. I mean probably getting rid of the 50%!steel tariffs would be a simple place to start. Take geothermal. The main issue is govt regulations that make it take way too long. 100-1000’s of GW can come on line pretty quickly if they can get permits in under 15 years. That’s a real number. I was at a talk on geothermal and one speaker is an actual developer. 15 years is what it took his last well for permits. While a mining company took weeks to get a well permit. Or oil and gas guys probably takes seconds. Here is to Hope. [Reply](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/www.nakedcapitalism.com#comment-4281282) ↓ 1. Aye, and it’s not just geothermal where permitting takes excessively long: High-voltage transmission lines are another.

I’ve been following the 1.3GW Eagle Mountain project in California, which would increase the state’s grid ~30GWh of grid storage capability by a substantial 22GWh. It would really help with their curtailment issues. The permitting process started in 2008, and they’re expecting to break ground in 2027, 19 years later. Presuming no additional delays, of course.

It’s mainly environmental reviews (my second link captures stuff from just the California Water Board; other state- and federally-required items are not listed). But then there are also the lawsuits. Infrastructure projects can run afoul of historical/cultural concerns and bring out the lawyers.

Thank you! [Reply](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/www.nakedcapitalism.com#comment-4281969) ↓ 2. My view is that Matt Stoller explained the situation much better than the conventional wisdom that AI is the driving force behind grid issues and rising prices. The neoliberal shift to utilities as profit earning, shareholder serving (self-serving for Execs) entities with monopolies that prioritize share prices over quality service explains it all.

Thanks for this. It’s a great reminder of how well Matt Stoller explains why we can’t have nice things. [Reply](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/www.nakedcapitalism.com#comment-4281236) ↓ 2. Agreed. The nation was sold the idea that deregulation and decoupling generation and delivery would create competitive markets and that would drive investment in building out generation as needed. However, there is nothing in any part of electricity generation or delivery that does not include massive, fixed costs which means every part of it operates on a downward sloping cost curve or by definition is monopolistic in its cost and pricing structure. The limiting of supply is how profits are maximized by this type of entity. There is no private utility incentive to invest in optimizing any part of the grid.

[Reply](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/www.nakedcapitalism.com#comment-4281410) ↓ 5. One major thing everyone is missing is that the physical grid is decaying and falling apart. The local power thieves where I live charge $25 dollars a month connection fee to maintain the infrastructure. When a member of the COOP have been connected for 20 years the get some sort of rebate. Well the management wanted to increase their bonus, so the got in to the reserve and gave the members a $20-100 rebate. The power line are in bad shape in a lot of areas. Here in the Northwest we’ve had numerous major fires started by power line failures. The Obama administration gave the power companies billions to upgrade the grid. All that happened is they put in smart meters, laid off meter reader and linemen, fixed little or nothing and management got big bonuses. The clown here about four years ago got rid of all the linemen and went to contractor services. A year later we had a massive winter storm took out a lot of power lines. All the contractor service companies were all engaged in the Southwest in hurricane damage repair and some customers went a month without grid power. They did hire a few linemen back. The power lines that run a long my property are 100+ years old. At least their copper. The grid aluminium lines are getting in bad shape especially the major transmission lines. Aluminium line start crystallizing after a period of time. This increases the resistive power loss, that increases heat in the power line causing the lines to to stretch and sag. There’s no national plan to even upgrade the major transmission lines. How in hell are the going to power it? You can build any type power generation system but need to have a way to transmit the power. So most of the AI cost will end up on the rate payers. The local power rates here have gone up at least 10% per year this year it was 12%. The local COOP byes most of it’s power from Bonneville Power Administration. Four years ago to get power to my property was $35K. So I’m 100% off the grid, with backup generator and a rack Lion batteries for a lot less than $35K. By the way I have hit ROI. My power is basically free except when I need to run the backup generator. Also, the local power COOP will not buy my excess power. I offered to give it to them for free if they would bank say 10% of the power and let me use it instead of my generator. No luck. In the summer I have enough spare to cover the AC for at 2 houses. So we as country have no nation wide energy plan, like China, no one even looks at reality. The F\\*\\*ing government will stick us with cost of AI infrastructure while most likely a people will not be able to afford power and food at the same time. Where in the hell are we going? [Reply](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/www.nakedcapitalism.com#comment-4281502) ↓ 6. What people are not taking into account is the incredible drop in price for battery storage. The issue most of the grid has is peak not daily. More storage can all but eliminate the more urgent calls to provide peak load power Battery storage is about $.01-$.02 per kWh. It’s cheap It’s the fastest to install, small footprint and modular. Lots of ways to work the system to make it work way better.

This demonstrates how cyber operations have evolved beyond merely gathering intelligence. When first identified by US government partners back in mid-2023, the campaign by the Salt Typhoon group was assessed as a targeted espionage effort against US and allied government systems. It involved stealthy intrusions, selective data theft and probing of networks in a handful of countries. At the time, the effect was thought to be limited and largely confined to government targets. But August 2025 disclosures have shown just how broad the campaign truly has been. The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has [publicly attributed](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/countering-chinese-state-sponsored-actors-compromise-of-networks-worldwide-to-feed-global-espionage-system) the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. They are central to rivalry. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge. The Indo-Pacific is the epicentre of 21st-century competition. China and the US vie for influence, while South Korea, India, Japan and Southeast Asian countries all face mounting digital vulnerabilities. With the digital economy of Southeast Asian nations expected to surpass US$1 [trillion](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/asean-building-trust-digital-economy/) by 2030, growth is driving their prosperity but also compounding risk. Chinese-sponsored hackers have been targeting critical infrastructure for a long time. Suspected Chinese hackers disrupted India’s [port](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/securing-indian-ports-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-and-the-road-ahead) logistics in 2020, and repeated intrusions have targeted Japanese, South Korean and Australian energy grids, telecom systems and government networks. Cyber operations are applied to traditional hotspots—such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait—by threatening disruption without any shots being fired. Beyond the sheer number of cyber incidents, patterns in their objectives distinguish cyber operations in the Indo-Pacific from those in other regions. Three stand out: probing, pressuring, and threshold testing. Probing operations aim to identify and target system vulnerabilities. Chinese threat group APT41 often employs this method. The [group](https://cyberscoop.com/apt41-fireeye-china/) has conducted espionage operations across healthcare, telecoms and government agencies for many years. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has perfected a distinct form of probing: cyber-heists, ranging from the 2016 Bangladesh Bank [hack](https://cyber.uk/areas-of-cyber-security/cyber-security-threat-groups-2/nation-state-hackers-case-study-bangladesh-bank-heist/) to ongoing cryptocurrency thefts that directly fund Pyongyang’s weapons programs. These operations map vulnerabilities and generate funds, while staying below the threshold of conventional war. Australia has been a repeated target of pressuring tactics, with the [breaches](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/reports-and-statistics/annual-cyber-threat-report-2023-2024) of critical infrastructure widely interpreted as signaling that Canberra’s alignment with Washington has costs. Taiwan is another case in point. During its 2024 elections, disinformation campaigns, distributed denial-of-service attacks on government portals, and breaches of media outlets sought to [undermine](https://saferinternetlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Panel-4-Summer.pdf) confidence in the democratic process. These pressures were synchronised with more visible coercion, such as military exercises and air incursions, illustrating how digital operations complement kinetic manoeuvres. Some cyber campaigns appear to be aimed at threshold-testing, blurring the line between espionage and sabotage. In the Vietnam–China cyber [clashes](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/vietnams-securitisation-of-cybersecurity-under-growing-chinese-cyber-threats/) related to South China Sea disputes, Vietnamese hackers allegedly targeted Chinese government websites. Similarly, the 2021 Japan Olympics cyberattacks, which [some](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54600098) attributed to Russian actors, demonstrated how geopolitical rivalries could extend into civilian life. Together, these incidents outline a region where states and non-state actors continually challenge each other’s resolve. Skirmishes might not cause immediate destruction, but they foster digital coercion and raise the risk of escalation. Cyber campaigns are not just harassment; some signal a potential for escalation. Attacks against Taiwan’s government networks have spiked during Chinese military drills, showing how cyber and kinetic tools are increasingly integrated. The danger lies in miscalculation. A ransomware strike that disrupts Japan’s energy grid or South Korea’s financial sector could be interpreted as state-backed aggression, prompting military responses. In cyberspace, where [attribution](https://academic.oup.com/isp/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/isp/ekae022/7903056) is murky and timeframes are compressed, escalation could outrun diplomacy. Repeated incidents also risk normalising cyber coercion as a standard tool of statecraft. If probing and pressure go unchallenged, adversaries will keep pushing until the region faces a full-scale digital confrontation. The Indo-Pacific has become a laboratory for cyber conflict, setting global precedents. Europe, Latin America and Africa should watch closely: today’s coercion in Asia could become tomorrow’s global standard. Cyber skirmishes in the Indo-Pacific mark the cutting edge of strategic competition, where adversaries test limits and normalise coercion. The region’s growing dependence on digital infrastructure, combined with its strategic volatility, makes it a perilous testing ground for cyber conflict globally. The choice is stark: treat these incidents as minor disruptions until one sparks a crisis, or act to strengthen resilience, deepen cooperation and set rules for [responsible](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/curbing-the-cost-of-cybersecurity-fragmentation-an-agenda-for-harmonisation-across-the-indo-pacific/) behaviour in cyberspace. If governments fail, adversaries will decide the thresholds for acceptable action—and by then it may be too late.

    "full_text": "The cyber attack is understood to have hit Collins Aerospace’s Muse software - which allows different airlines to use the same check-in desks and boarding gates at an airport, rather than requiring their own. (Representative image: Pexels) The Delhi airport uses a check-in and baggage software that was impacted by a cyberattack, affecting services in multiple European airports in London (Heathrow), Brussels and Berlin, but has not yet experienced any disruptions, a government audit has found. Prompted by a cyberattack that caused technical issues affecting software provided by Collins Aerospace to several airlines in Europe, the Indian government’s audit found that no Indian airports have yet been affected by the breach. The cyber attack is understood to have hit Collins Aerospace’s Muse software – which allows different airlines to use the same check-in desks and boarding gates at an airport, rather than requiring their own. As its system was down, ground crew at impacted airports had to carry out some of these processes manually, resulting in long wait times and flight cancellations. In a travel advisory, Air India said, “A third-party passenger system disruption at Heathrow may cause delays in the check-in process. Our ground teams in London are working to minimise inconvenience. Passengers flying with us from London today are advised to complete their web check-in before arriving at the airport to help ensure a smooth experience”. A senior IT Ministry official said that the government had contacted the chief information security officer of GMR, which manages airports in cities like Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Goa as part of its audit into the breach. While Delhi airport was found to be using the Muse software, Hyderabad and Goa airports were not using it. There were also no issues observed at the Bengaluru airport. “Delhi has not faced any impact so far but there is no clear communication from the vendor Collins. However they are in touch with Collins,” a senior government official said. Adani operated Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Jaipur, Mangaluru, Guwahati, and Thiruvananthapuram airports do not use the Collins Muse application, and while the new Navi Mumbai airport does, it is not yet operational there, the official said. Story continues below this ad “There is no impact observed so far as per our conversation with multiple entities in the country. The Collins Muse application is mainly used in European countries and as per open source intel only selected European airports were impacted due the incident. We are contacting Collins over email, as direct phone contact is not available,” the official added. As the breach jolted operations at several key European airports, Heathrow Airport said, “Collins Aerospace, which provides check-in and boarding systems for several airlines across multiple airports globally, is experiencing a technical issue that may cause delays for departing passengers. While the provider works to resolve the problem quickly, we advise passengers to check their flight status with their airline before travelling. Please arrive no earlier than three hours before a long-haul flight or two hours before a domestic flight.

This marks a strategic shift from using AI primarily in forecasting and scheduling to deploying it as a core reliability and security layer for India’s rapidly transforming power system. With renewable energy projected to cross 500 gigawatt (GW) before 2030, grid managers warned that the system’s growing complexity demands machine-speed decision-making. “The grid’s physical and digital layers are now inseparable. As variability increases, we can’t depend on post-fault analysis alone — AI must give us situational awareness before faults propagate,” said chairman and managing director of Grid India Samir Chandra Saxena at the KPMG energy conference. Until now, AI in the power sector has mainly been used for load forecasting, renewable generation prediction, and revenue optimisation, especially for wind and solar. The new phase aims to go much further — using real-time streaming data at 40-millisecond resolution to track emerging instability across the network before it triggers cascading outages. He said AI systems will detect weak points and abnormal patterns across geographically dispersed but connected assets, helping avert wide-area blackouts. The systems will also automatically trigger corrective actions or alerts to grid control centres, reducing response times from minutes to seconds. This represents a leap in operational philosophy, shifting from reactive post-fault analysis to predictive, pre-fault intervention. Officials said the architecture will be layered into the national load despatch centre (NLDC) and gradually scaled down to state and regional control rooms. Saxena also flagged rising cyber security and market integrity threats as grid digitalisation deepens. The national grid is increasingly interconnected with regional markets, gas pipelines, cross-border trade platforms, and financial derivatives tied to electricity, creating new vectors of risk. AI will be deployed to monitor behavioural patterns of market participants holding simultaneous positions in physical power, fuel supply and financial contracts, to detect possible manipulative behaviour or insider collusion. Additionally, AI-driven threat hunting, anomaly detection and behavioural analytics will be introduced to combat malware or coordinated cyberattacks on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, he disclosed. “We are seeing the threat perimeter blur — a cyber-attack or price manipulation at one node can ripple across the system in seconds. AI will be essential to watch for patterns humans can’t spot in real time.” He acknowledged that AI deployment at grid scale brings its own risks, especially around false positives, bias, and over-reliance on automated decisions. To address this, “the government is preparing a national AI assurance framework for critical infrastructure, mandating explainable AI models, human-in-the-loop oversight, and clear escalation protocols for grid operations.” There are also plans to upskill system operators and control room engineers in data science, AI ethics and algorithmic risk management to ensure trust and accountability in decision-making. The framework will draw on best practices from the EU’s AI Act and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Other industry experts warned that India’s grid is entering a new era of operational complexity driven by massive solar and wind additions, rooftop and behind-the-meter generation, electric vehicle load spikes and green hydrogen clusters. “Managing a 500 GW+ renewables-heavy grid will be impossible without machine-speed situational awareness. AI will not be optional — it will be the backbone,” said one of senior power sector executives on the panel. The planned AI integration signals a paradigm shift — positioning India’s grid not just as a physical network of wires and generators, but as a data-rich, intelligent system able to self-diagnose and self-correct in real time.

    "title": "Beyond Forecasting: India to Rewire Its Power Grid With AI, A New Era of Energy Security",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "India is embarking on a strategic shift in its power sector, preparing to embed artificial intelligence deep into the operations of its national electricity grid. This move, announced by senior officials, aims to enable real-time risk detection, fault prediction, and market surveillance, moving beyond AI’s traditional role in forecasting. The initiative is a response to the growing complexity of the grid, which is set to handle over 500 gigawatts of renewable energy before 2030, requiring machine-speed decision-making to maintain stability and security. A Grid Under Pressure India is poised to undertake a fundamental transformation of its national power grid, the largest unified grid in the world, by integrating artificial intelligence into its core operations. This strategic pivot, a significant departure from the current use of AI primarily for forecasting, is designed to create a data-rich, intelligent system capable of real-time risk detection, fault prediction, and even market manipulation surveillance. The move comes as the nation rapidly scales up its renewable energy capacity, which is projected to exceed 500 gigawatts (GW) before 2030, introducing unprecedented levels of variability and complexity into the grid. At a recent energy conference, Samir Chandra Saxena, chairman and managing director of Grid India, articulated the urgency of this shift. “The grid’s physical and digital layers are now inseparable, as variability increases, we can’t depend on post-fault analysis alone AI must give us situational awareness before faults propagate.” he said. India to Honour Top CISOs from Police, Law Enforcement, and Defence Forces This new phase will utilize AI to process real-time streaming data at a 40-millisecond resolution, a dramatic leap from the current reactive operational philosophy. The goal is to track emerging instability across the network and trigger pre-emptive, corrective actions in seconds, not minutes, averting cascading outages before they can occur. This proactive approach is deemed essential for managing a grid with a growing share of intermittent energy sources like solar and wind, as well as new complexities from electric vehicle load spikes and green hydrogen clusters. AI to Serve as Grid’s Digital Backbone Against New Threats The digitalization of India’s grid, while crucial for the energy transition, has also opened it up to a new array of threats. Officials warn of rising cybersecurity and market integrity risks, as the national grid becomes increasingly interconnected with regional markets, gas pipelines, cross-border trade platforms, and financial derivatives. AI is being positioned as a key defensive layer against these emerging vectors of risk. AI-driven systems will be deployed to monitor behavioral patterns of market participants, scrutinizing simultaneous positions in physical power, fuel supply, and financial contracts to detect potential manipulative behavior or insider collusion. In parallel, AI-driven threat hunting and behavioral analytics will be introduced to combat malware or coordinated cyberattacks on the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that underpin the grid’s operations. “We are seeing the threat perimeter blur,” Mr. Saxena noted. “A cyber-attack or price manipulation at one node can ripple across the system in seconds. AI will be essential to watch for patterns humans can’t spot in real time.” The integration of AI, therefore, is not merely an efficiency measure but a core component of national security for critical infrastructure. Building Trust and Accountability in an Automated Future The planned AI integration, while promising, also brings its own set of risks, including false positives, algorithmic bias, and an over-reliance on automated decisions. Recognizing these challenges, the government is preparing a national AI assurance framework specifically for critical infrastructure. This framework will mandate the use of explainable AI models, human-in-the-loop oversight, and clear escalation protocols for grid operations. FCRF Academy Invites Legal Experts to Shape India’s First Comprehensive Cyber Law Certification Furthermore, there are explicit plans to upskill system operators and control room engineers in data science, AI ethics, and algorithmic risk management. This initiative aims to build trust and ensure accountability in a decision-making process that will increasingly be automated. The framework is expected to draw on best practices from global standards, including the European Union’s AI Act and guidelines from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), signifying a comprehensive approach to securing and operationalizing this new technological paradigm. The integration of AI, as one senior power sector executive stated, “AI is no longer an experiment. For the Indian grid, it’s survival.”",

Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

In terms of tariffs against New Delhi, the ball's in America's court. (HARVEPINO/Shutterstock) ## Highlights - _The prospects of a U.S.-India trade war — which would be marked by U.S. tariffs on a wide range of Indian imports — will hinge on the outcome of a possible U.S. investigation into India's trade practices._ - _India, which recognizes it's a lower priority in U.S. trade negotiations, will be more likely to negotiate a trade package once a new government is formed after its national elections conclude later this month._ - _If India chooses to continue buying Iranian oil, it will buy a reduced amount under a rupee-based payment mechanism to avoid U.S. sanctions._ There's nothing like a common rival to bring two powers together -- at least on defense. India and the United States, both eyeing China's rise with concern, are moving closer militarily. Their common strategic interest in countering China, however, does not mean an alignment on trade: The United States is pushing India to further open its markets to American commerce, halt its purchase of Iranian oil and ease recent e-commerce regulations that could impede foreign investment. The demands, in fact, have even fueled speculation that India could emerge as a new front in U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war. But with limited ability to retaliate, India will seek to avoid any larger trade disputes with the United States, a vital export market. Even so, the prospects for a confrontation will ultimately depend on how the United States chooses to act. Washington has shown it has no qualms about launching trade disputes...

Organizations like the VHP are on the upswing as Hindu nationalism grows in India. (NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power.

Until New Delhi addresses the underlying grievances spurring unrest in Kashmir Valley, its residents will continue to oppose Indian rule. (TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP/Getty Images) Kashmir is known throughout South Asia for its natural beauty, which draws visitors from far and wide. But beneath the region's alluring exterior, deep-seated grievances are beginning to jeopardize its stability. On July 8, Indian security forces killed Burhan Wani, the 22-year-old commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, a militant separatist group that calls for the India-administered portion of the region (Jammu and Kashmir) to join Pakistan. The organization's fighters regularly sustain casualties, but Wani's death set off widespread protests in the state's capital, Srinagar. In an effort to contain the situation, New Delhi temporarily shuttered at least four major Kashmiri newspapers, cut off mobile phone and internet access to the region, and imposed a curfew that has yet to be lifted. These measures have not stopped the demonstrations, however, and clashes between protesters and security forces have left more than 50 dead and 3,000 injured. New Delhi has pointed the finger at...

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "India’s electricity demand surged to an all-time high in August 2025, touching a peak of 2,29,715 megawatts (MW), according to the latest data released by the National Load Despatch Centre (NLDC). The country successfully met a total of 1.50 lakh million units (MU) of energy during the month, signalling a robust uptick in economic activity and seasonal consumption patterns. The highest demand of the month was recorded on 7 August when the grid saw an unprecedented load of 2,29,715 MW, setting a new benchmark for the power sector. Throughout the month, the average peak demand stood at 2,15,314 MW, while the average daily energy met hovered around 4,854 MU. NLDC data revealed a consistent number of days in the first half of August when power demand crossed the 2.2 lakh MW mark, reinforcing the trend of elevated consumption. The total energy supplied during the month was reported at 1,50,472 MU, indicating a strong performance by the country’s power infrastructure in managing the demand surge. This spike in electricity usage comes on the back of similar trends observed earlier this year. Record peaks were also registered in June and July 2025, highlighting the ongoing rise in power consumption across sectors.",

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "# The AI Boom Might Be Triggering Electrical Surges And Outages In Your Area By [Briley Kenney](https://www.bgr.com/author/brileykenney/) Sept. 27, 2025 10:17 am EST Imaginima/Getty Images You're in the middle of watching your favorite show, or playing through a recent game and, without warning, the power flickers or goes out completely. It happens, and it's a bummer. Worse yet, you never really know how long the power is going to be out. It could be quick — just a minor (if annoying) inconvenience — or it could take hours. The obvious culprit for these outages is a storm in your area, infrastructure concerns, seasonal temperature extremes, or local energy spikes that put a lot of strain on the grid. But with that last scenario, it turns out there might be a very specific cause behind those blackouts. In particular, an increase in AI usage could be to blame, and it might make [your power bill go up, even if you don't use it](https://www.bgr.com/1950123/ai-might-make-your-power-bill-increase/). According to data from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=table_5_03), the average U.S. household paid 17.47 cents per kilowatt-hour in May 2025, compared to 16.41 cents in May 2024. That's a 6.5% cost increase in just a year, which is, historically, a pretty big spike. It doesn't just highlight rising costs, though; it shows that energy consumption is higher than ever, too. Part of the reason those costs are increasing is because everyone is using more energy. Of course, the next question is whether or not AI is truly to blame for higher consumption. After all, you don't necessarily know from this information if AI is triggering electrical surges and outages, right? But spoiler alert: Not only is AI causing outages, it's even making residential power worse, according to a report from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-ai-power-home-appliances/). ## How do we know AI is a problem? Gerville/Getty Images According to experts on the topic such as Whisker Labs and DC Byte, data centers which also support AI usage and applications are putting a big strain on the electrical grid and its aging infrastructure. That is known thanks to information gathered using Ting devices, which are smart sensors that can monitor electrical quality in residential homes. They're primarily meant to reduce or prevent electrical fires, but the sensors inside also measure something referred to as \"bad harmonics.\" Or, perhaps more accurately, it's called total harmonic distortion, which causes reduced energy efficiency and can damage appliances and home electronics. Bad harmonics occur when the normal flow of electricity is interrupted, resulting in electrical spikes — increases in voltage — and, conversely, dips. For reference, a good harmonic is essentially a continued and balanced wave of electrical voltage. [Bloomberg's report](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-ai-power-home-appliances/) shows that the worst distortions happen within close proximity to major data centers: Over 75% are often within 50 miles, and that affects nearly 3.7 million Americans in total. Moreover, the worst distortions are happening in Northern Virginia, Chicago, and areas where there is a high concentration of data centers. Unlike the steady, predictable increase in demand caused by factors like population growth, this creation of new data centers can put near-instant pressure on the local infrastructure. Those power demands are suddenly exponentially higher. (All that said, the tech isn't entirely bad; AI-powered topology optimization could be [a cheap, easy way to supercharge America's power grid](https://www.bgr.com/science/theres-a-cheap-easy-way-to-supercharge-americas-power-grid/).) ## Why is power quality important? MemoryMan/Shutterstock In addition to damaging appliances and electronics, poor power quality can also cause malfunctions, overheating, and spark electrical fires, which is certainly a scary prospect. In other words, there is a serious concern about these outages, aside from people being without power — and for a lot of us, that's already bad enough. It's not just about the \"haves\" and \"have nots,\" but the potential consequences of decreasing power quality for everyone. An uptick in electrical fires, for example, is a very real possibility, and it's a particularly concerning one at a time when wildfires are a huge concern in various areas across the country. While devices like Ting do exist to help, imagine having to monitor the power quality in your home or apartment and limiting what can be plugged in, from appliances and media devices to lighting and beyond. Power rationing could also become a very real concern, and it's something that there really is no precedent for, at least not at the moment. Power companies might have to do this to preserve the grid. But how would you decide what power goes where and how much? Fortunately, there are some other solutions in play. In Virginia, for instance, data centers are being required to build dedicated substations and transformers to handle the increase in power and protect residential circuits. And startups like Exowatt are working to make modular systems dedicated to producing clean energy to run these data centers. Depending on how this all plays out, however, other long-term solutions may soon be necessary. It might be time to start tapping into [unexpected energy sources that can be used as fuel](https://www.bgr.com/1952799/little-known-things-used-as-fuel/), like seawater, urine, or plastic waste. ## Recommended",

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "U.S. policymakers are eyeing a tougher tactic to curb the surge in Big Tech’s electricity use. During grid emergencies, large data centers could be temporarily disconnected so homes and hospitals stay powered. Texas acted first. In June, following the deadly 2021 winter freeze that left dozens dead, lawmakers told regulators to craft rules requiring utilities to curtail the biggest customers when supply tightens. The aim is to free enough capacity on a small number of extreme heat or cold days each year to prevent wider outages. A similar discussion is now taking shape on the mid-Atlantic system, which spans 13 states, and in other regions as sprawling server farms are appearing faster than new generation can be permitted and tied into the grid. The idea has drawn resistance from operators and major tech firms that rely on uninterrupted service around the clock. Like many places, Texas still courts these projects for jobs and tax revenue, yet the power draw is formidable. Demand has climbed since the late-2022 launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT set off a global sprint to build generative-AI services that require heavy compute. “We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.” Too many data centers, not enough power Planners in Texas, the Great Plains and the mid-Atlantic have issued forecasts showing steep load growth over the next few years, with data centers a major contributor. PJM Interconnection, which manages the mid-Atlantic grid serving 65 million people and big clusters in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, has floated an approach akin to Texas. The Southwest Power Pool, covering about 18 million people across Kansas, Oklahoma, and neighboring Great Plains states, says it must widen power-reduction programs, likely focusing on the largest users, to keep pace with demand. These proposals arrive as electricity costs nationwide have been increasing at roughly double the inflation rate, federal data show, and as evidence mounts that ordinary customers may be subsidizing Big Tech’s outsized consumption. New plants and wires are not coming online fast enough, analysts warn. “Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic system, as mentioned in an Associated Press report. Operators may need to change operations Tech companies say they are squeezing more efficiency out of facilities and installing backup generation, often diesel, to ride through outages. But many did not expect to be asked to use that on-site power to help the grid during scarcity events, and they are watching closely as Texas regulators write the details. The Data Center Coalition, representing major tech firms and developers, is urging flexible rules because some sites cannot switch to backup as quickly as others. The group also says any program should include payments for facilities that choose to power down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the coalition. PJM’s newly released concept would mean proposed data centers might not be guaranteed electric service during a declared emergency. The suggestion has unsettled both generators and the tech sector. “This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and developers, said in written comments. Governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois, and Maryland argued the idea is too unpredictable to serve as a lasting fix and should be paired with incentives for facilities to build their own power and cut load voluntarily. Consumer advocates said it would not meaningfully lower bills and urged a “bring your own generation” requirement so projects supply dedicated power.

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

The two countries are close to a short-term trade deal, but a long-term pact is an entirely different proposition. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) The United States' trade war with China grabs all the headlines, but U.S. President Donald Trump is also bearing down on another major Asian economy: India. In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain goods at a reduced tariff rate. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration retaliated by slapping tariffs on 28 U.S. goods. While the sides could soon clinch a short-term trade deal, the United States and India will have several outstanding issues to address before they finalize a more comprehensive pact. With the United States demanding that India reduce its bilateral trade surplus, open its economy to more U.S. agricultural products and go easier on U.S. technology giants, the countries remain far apart on a longer-term deal....
