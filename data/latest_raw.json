These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. India’s long-running class-based, economic insurgency—the Naxalite insurgency (or Community Party of India [CPI]-Maoist insurgency)—is a case study in which external secu\u0002rity partnerships will remain limited, if not mostly unwelcomed, in New Delhi. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of do\u0002mestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Washington would be ill-served by an In\u0002dian backlash to such unwelcomed assertiveness. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime secu\u0002rity activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counter\u0002terrorism intelligence-sharing and operations. The United States instead should focus on not only its offers of major near-term bilateral military assistance for security cooperation but also, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns in New Delhi and Washington. 2 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Introduction This paper frames the contours of the recent and ongoing expansion in U.S.-India security ties. Then it briefly sketches the trajectory of the Naxalite insurgency through its first two phases and then focuses on the factors that made its third phase—from 2004 to the present—such a serious security challenge. The paper highlights the unique domestic factors that allowed the Naxalite rebellion’s rise to the status of India’s most significant internal security challenge from 2007 to 2010. It also identifies those domestic factors that enabled effective counterinsurgency actions beginning in 2011 and effective containment of the threat by 2014. After indicating the kinds of bilateral security assistance offered by the United States to India in recent years, the paper indicates the limited appeal of outside assistance to India in the domestic counterinsur\u0002gency arena and assesses why India’s self-selected counterinsurgency partnership limitations remain firmly in place. It concludes with some lessons learned for U.S. policymakers in terms of the opportunities and limitations for working with India in matters of domestic insurgency, advising that these limitations make sense on many levels. It also asserts that India’s limitations should be respected in Washington and Honolulu to avoid backlash from New Delhi. Any such backlash might threaten far more important U.S.-India bilateral interests in which shared mari\u0002time and other strategic interests seem to increasingly diverge with those of China and in areas of mutual benefit from global counterterrorism cooperation. The analysis in this paper is based on 3 years of author research into the unique features of the Naxalite insurgency in India. The research includes field interviews conducted on three visits to India during 2014 and 2015, one of which featured time in Kolkata and West Bengal. Expanding U.S.-India Security Framework, with Limits Growing for more than a decade, bilateral defense and security cooperation between the United States and India began accelerating quickly in 2014 and continued into 2016. Much of this acceleration, although not all of it, owed to the tone and tenor of the Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, elected and seated in 2014. Modi’s government, which is Indian nationalist with a dynamic economic, diplomatic, and security agenda, followed a decade-long Indian National Congress (INC) government that had become sclerotic in its dealings with the United States and other global partners from 2009 to 2013. The INC government set the table for U.S.-India defense and security cooperation during the mid-2000s, demonstrating a broad\u0002based Indian commitment to improved bilateral relations with the United States after decades 3 India’s Naxalite Insurgency of limited transactions. But the nationalist government of Prime Minister Modi has been driv\u0002ing it forward vigorously. The ongoing acceleration in broad Indo-American relations has taken many forms, in\u0002cluding high diplomacy. Prime Minister Modi made visiting the United States a priority, travel\u0002ing to America within 4 months of his May 2014 accession to the position of prime minister. Modi then made President Barack Obama the first ever U.S. President bestowed the high honor as chief guest at India’s Republic Day Parade in January 2015. During this visit, Obama and Modi signed a historic Joint U.S.-India Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region.1 Modi made a third informal visit to the United States in September 2015, using this historically rapid return to enhance economic relations between the national private and public sectors.2 The United States has committed to a wide array of economic projects in India fea\u0002turing public-private innovation, deeper financial cooperation and inclusive digital networks, “smart city” development in selected Indian cities, and support for increasing economic con\u0002nectivity between India and the states of South and Southeast Asia.3 The acceleration of broad bilateral ties has been showcased by the steady increase in de\u0002fense and security cooperation between the two countries. In June 2016, on a historic fourth visit to the United States and in conjunction with a third bilateral summit,4 Prime Minister Modi made a joint statement with President Obama declaring India and the United States to be “major defense partners,” expressing aspirations for expanded exchange of dual-use technolo\u0002gies and maritime security cooperation.5 The outcomes from this mid-2016 leadership engage\u0002ment underscored the fact that there have been noteworthy enhancements in military technol\u0002ogy interaction processes, basic military logistics and administrative arrangements, and joint military exercises. Since 2014, Prime Minister Modi has accelerated the process of bilateral security collabo\u0002ration on military modernization with emphasis on greater foreign investment in the Indian defense sector than ever before. Modi’s government covets American participation in India’s defense industry build-out to a degree not seen in the previous Indian government. The United States has worked to expand its 2012 bilateral defense initiative with India known as the U.S.- India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI). Pursuant to President Obama’s January 2015 visit for Republic Day, the United States has focused DTTI in pursuit of six major defense technology co-development and co-production efforts. There has been a particular focus on deeper cooperation in the areas of maritime security and maritime domain awareness.6 The United States and India also have done serious work on establishing basic frame\u0002work defense agreements that would enable closer cooperation and collaboration between their 4 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 militaries. Throughout 2015 and early 2016, both governments worked hard to develop mutu\u0002ally acceptable text for three critical military-to-military agreements. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), Basic Exchange and Coopera\u0002tion Agreement (BECA), and—perhaps the most consequential of the three—Logistics Supply Agreement.7 Aimed to move beyond the limited U.S.-India 2002 General Security of Military Information Agreement that underpinned modest U.S.-India defense interactions for more than a decade, the bilateral effort on these documents demonstrated important forward prog\u0002ress. Yet this progress did not beget culmination in formal agreements. Many observers hoped that these arrangements would be ready for signature during Secretary of Defense Ash Carter’s April 2016 visit to New Delhi for discussions with Minister of Defense Manohar Parrikar. But Indian sensitivities and complications in language and trust limited the April joint announce\u0002ment to one confirming that the defense leaders were agreed in principal—but had not yet signed—a modified Logistics Supply Agreement, known as a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement.8 It also signaled that both parties must continue to work on “other” agreements to enhance military cooperation and technology transfer. The CISMOA and BECA were not formally mentioned in the final statement of the meeting.9 In the area of joint military exercises, the U.S.-India partnership has been expanding. In 2015, India conducted more joint military exercises with the U.S. military than any other in the world.10 India and United States agreed in 2015 to extend a permanent invitation for Japanese naval forces to participate annually in Exercise Malabar. The United States, India, and Japan held Malabar 2016 in early June in the northern waters of the Philippine Sea, an area close to the East and South China seas, signaling to Beijing that the three nations hold a common interest in freedom of high seas navigation in all areas of the Pacific Ocean.11 But the acceleration and expansion of bilateral security interactions come with Indian limitations—ones that must temper U.S. policymaker aims, ambitions, and expectations. While agreeing to participate in the 2016 Malabar exercise with Japan and the United States in the northern Philippines, India firmly declined an offer by the commander of U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, to sign on for joint naval patrols with the United States, Japan, and Aus\u0002tralia in the South Pacific.12 India also has remained wary of any firm commitment to a bilateral defense CISMOA or BECA. Despite more than 2 years of bilateral effort, there remains no real progress on the joint development of jet engines or aircraft carrier technologies—both of which are target technologies for joint development.13 Each of these factors and more demonstrate that crafting a bilateral defense partnership between the United States and India will be a slow process 5 India’s Naxalite Insurgency that requires better understanding of differing critical equities. This process requires sustained, patient leadership in both countries in the face of certain frustrations moving forward. Scoping Bilateral Security Collaboration Limits: Indian Domestic Counterinsurgency and Counterterrorism The U.S. and Indian militaries have their own detailed and unique experiences in counter\u0002insurgency operations, so counterinsurgency seems a logical focal point for greater U.S.-India defense collaboration and partnership, and in many ways it is. But in other ways, it is not. U.S. policymakers and security analysts should understand the differences. When it comes to outside assistance and security partnership collaboration with India in its ongoing experiences with domestic insurgency, U.S. policymakers and military leaders must remain aware that India does not—and likely will not—treat U.S. military offers of direct assis\u0002tance with a warm welcome. India’s experiences with its long-running domestic Naxalite insur\u0002gency provide a powerful example about the limited scope for U.S. military engagement and the circumspect manner in which any U.S. security assistance must be approached with New Delhi. The lessons about context, tenor, and tone found in the example of the Naxalite insurgency over the past 10 years demonstrate that the United States is a better partner for India when remaining at distance, as New Delhi deals with its unique domestic insurgency challenges. India’s Approach to Domestic Insurgency Over the past 60 years, India has confronted three major domestic insurgencies.14 In Jam\u0002mu and Kashmir, disaffected Muslim groups and unsatisfied local populations have contested India’s so-called occupation of its territories on the southeastern side of the Line of Control. India’s northeast has undergone multiple, overlapping waves of tribal, socioethnic-based insur\u0002gent movements since the mid-1950s. These northeastern separatist insurgencies have ebbed and flowed as Indian military and political approaches to their grievances eliminated some and catalyzed others. India also has been confronted with economic class–based violence and armed confrontation in its eastern regions, violence referred to as a Naxalite or Maoist insurgency. Numerous Indian analysts, and some outsiders, argue that India has among the best re\u0002cords in the world when combating insurgencies.15 The claim is debatable on many levels. Yet it does accurately reflect that India has persistent experience with a variety of domestic insurgencies over a considerable period of time. Official Indian counterinsurgency doctrine formally espouses a population-centric strategy focused on winning “hearts and minds.”16 A more detailed examination of India’s record reveals that India often does take a political 6 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 approach in combination with a military one when facing domestic insurgencies. However, India’s political approaches often are less about hearts and minds and more often feature ex\u0002tended periods of national-level tolerance of state- and local-level politician and police leader\u0002ship manipulation of insurgent groups. Often this manipulation is in the pursuit of regional and local vote banks (or vote blocks). Frequently manipulation is followed by the co-option of rebellion elites in an effort to buy-out, or limit the insurgency once it festers to a level beyond the ability of the state and regional authorities to manage. Co-option approaches have taken the forms of turning insurgents through monetary compensation, creating new political space for a “turned” insurgent group, or abducting and torturing key insurgent leaders.17 Quite often these nonkinetic approaches have created their own problems with corrupt security forces, increased criminal activity, and a litany of human rights complaints and investigations.18 India’s employment of military forces in domestic counterinsurgency operations has fea\u0002tured a number of innovative practices, some successful and others counterproductive. When engaged fully, the Indian national response tends to feature a combination of state police forces, Central Armed Police Forces, special paramilitary units, and—in some cases such as Kashmir and India’s Northeast—the introduction of regular army units. India’s federal statutes mandate that the chief minister (or governor) of a state formally request national police (including Cen\u0002tral Armed Police Forces units), paramilitary, or national army support before such forces can be introduced into a counterinsurgency fight. In those cases when the army is introduced, it must be authorized by the prime minister and given authorities by the Indian parliament to operate under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which includes the authority for military forces to make arrests, search without warrants, and shoot to kill civilians when required.19 In\u0002dia’s martial counterinsurgency activities are normally “enemy centric” and have been assessed to regularly feature a strategy of attrition and raw coercion where overwhelming numbers of security forces attempt to suffocate the insurgency at the same time that political activities are conducted to co-opt its leadership.20 There are several important conclusions to be drawn about India’s historical approach to domestic counterinsurgency. First, India does pursue varied counterinsurgency approaches to its multiple domestic insurgencies, depending on the unique context of each. Some respons\u0002es—such as those in Jammu and Kashmir and Northeast India—have featured a permanent deployment of the Indian army. Other responses, such as those toward the respective phases of the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India, have been limited to national central armed police forces (mainly but not exclusively Central Reserve Police Forces [CRPF]) deployment into the unsettled states from the central government (see appendix B for detail on national special 7 India’s Naxalite Insurgency police units). Second, India’s political and military approaches toward domestic insurgency generally do not follow a classic hearts and minds approach. Instead, they normally feature enemy-centric and highly kinetic military operations combined with creative, and often con\u0002troversial, political co-option of selected insurgent groups and group leaders. Third, India’s federal democratic structure often drives domestic counterinsurgency responses that feature uncomfortable political tradeoffs at the local level, state level, and between the state and the national governments. The political mobilization aspect of domestic insurgent groups creates incentives for political parties to harness these groups for their own ends.21 Invariably, this political utility makes them hard to counter in a timely manner and then difficult to address in the face of growing corruption, illegal activities, and often human rights questions as they embed into the political and social space. In general, Indian domestic counterinsurgency has worked for the country out and its distinctive system of governance and its complex national ethnic makeup. India’s approaches have contained, but not eliminated, the three major insurgencies that it has faced since inde\u0002pendence. But for many Westerners, India’s domestic counterinsurgency “successes” can look exceptionally violent and uncomfortably incomplete.22 This divergence in perspectives is im\u0002portant. It indicates why India prefers strict autonomy in the conduct of its domestic counterin\u0002surgent operations, routinely brushing aside the limited offers of direct outside military support that it receives. It also demonstrates why outside partners, including the United States, should realize that if they push too aggressively in offering well-intentioned direct assistance in these areas, they could encounter significant resistance in New Delhi—possible to the point where security cooperation could be dampened in other more important areas of mutual interest. India’s deep past and recent experiences with the Naxalite insurgency demonstrate the wisdom of these conclusions. The Naxalite Insurgency—History and Context: Phases 1 and 2 The Naxalite insurgency started as a communist peasant revolt in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It later evolved into a combination of ethnic-, caste-, and class-based political violence across a number of the poorest provinces in India’s east.23 It became known as Naxalism, or the Naxalite movement, given its late 1950s origins as a Maoist movement struggling for in\u0002dependence in the small village of Naxalbari in the state of West Bengal, along the Indo-Nepal border (see map 1).24 The 1967 Naxalbari uprising against feudal landlords sowed the seeds for insurgency in India.25 8 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 The Naxalites were a group of far-left radical communists who promoted Maoist political sentiment and ideology to fight exploitation by landlords in India’s feudal postcolonial socio\u0002economic system. In this approach, the Naxalites broke from the tradition of Indian communist Map 1. States and Union Territories of India 9 India’s Naxalite Insurgency political participation in the electoral system supplemented by general worker strikes that had been the staple of Communist Party of India activity from the 1920s through the 1950s.26 Dur\u0002ing the 1940s and 1950s, the CPI had become aligned with Moscow in its international leanings, functioning in India mainly as a political party. Around the same time, communism in India split in a third direction, with the CPI-Marxist group taking a more radical approach to its po\u0002litical rhetoric but mainly pursuing its own independent parliamentary path.27 Naxalism is based upon an extremist belief that the Indian government is a semicolonial, feudalistic, and imperial entity that needs to be overthrown. Naxalism’s objective is to seize state power through a protracted armed struggle against big landlords and petty government of\u0002ficials. Naxalism takes up the cause of the marginalized sections of society. It often opposes the implementation of various developmental projects such as construction of roads, rails, schools, and hospitals in affected areas in order to demonstrate to the people the ineffectiveness of the state. When successful, the Naxalite movement has operated in a vacuum created by the absence or collapse of the administrative structure at the local, provincial, or state level.28 The Naxalite movement has evolved through three separate phases in India. The first phase ran from the late 1960s through 1973. The second phase occurred from the late 1970s through 1994. The third and most significant phase formally began in 2004, reaching a peak of violence from 2005 to 2011 and declining to a nadir in 2014. A short review of the first two phases of the Naxalite insurgency establishes its patterns and India’s preferred security framework for dealing with this domestic stability threat. A more detailed review of the third and most noteworthy phase of the Naxalite insurgency follows in a subsequent section. First Phase, 1967–1973 Inspired by Maoist revolutionary tactics and the Cultural Revolution in China, the Naxalite movement gained momentum and began in the late 1960s and 1970s. Initially the movement centered in the Indian states of West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh (map 1). It featured peasants seizing land by force and then taking up arms to protect themselves against police and landlord response.29 Soon these rural activities merged with politically disillusioned and ideologically driven university students from Kolkata and other urban areas in India’s Far East—with active cells stretching from the state of Bihar in the north to Adhra Pradesh in the south. By 1969 un\u0002der charismatic leader Charu Mazumdar, the Naxalites organized as the CPI–Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) and attempted more centralized and violent tactics.30 CPI-ML moved to organize peasants and seize political power through guerilla warfare while focusing on annihilation of its class enemies.31 In urban areas such as Kolkata (then known as Calcutta), Naxalite insurgents 10 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 targeted police and local constables, attacking police outposts and patrols with an aim to cap\u0002ture weapons.32 Despite some limited weapons assistance and rhetorical support from Mao’s Communist government in the 1960s, China never undertook a strong campaign of support for the Nax\u0002alites.33 The Naxalites remained fragmented and without much training or organization. This first wave of Naxalite violence peaked in 1971 when over 3,650 acts of class-based attacks were reported and more than 850 people were reported killed. But it quickly succumbed to its own weaknesses and a state counterinsurgency response that featured two waves of activity. From the summer of 1969 through the end of 1971, state-led counterinsurgency campaigns against the rural Naxalite cadres decimated much of those insurgency cadres. State police, as\u0002sisted by the CRPF, moved against poorly armed Naxalites with great effect. By 1971 these po\u0002lice forces were joined by army units deployed into West Bengal. It took the failure of local and state police to contain Naxalite insurgents for more than 2 years before the West Bengal deputy chief minister—himself a politician from the CPI-Maoist party—requested assistance from a central paramilitary force, the Eastern Frontier Rifles, to assist state security forces. Then in July and August of 1971 a more dangerous component of the Naxalite insurgency in West Ben\u0002gal’s Birbhum District was put down by a joint campaign led by the army known as Operation Steeplechase. Army involvement only came after the collapse of an Indian National Congress– led coalition government in West Bengal and the New Delhi declaration of “President’s Rule” throughout the region. This made the central government responsible for the fight against the Naxalites and enabled Prime Minister Indira Ghandi to divert elements of the army massing along the East Pakistan border for what would become the December 1971 Indo-Pakistani War that assisted local police in decisive counterinsurgency operations.34 The urban dimension of the first wave of the Naxalite insurgency remained violent throughout 1971 and festered into the next 2 years, even as the rural component succumbed to Operation Steeplechase. Interparty political violence in Kolkata among the INC, CPI-M, and CPI-ML led to a swirl of assassinations and attacks against security forces and political leaders across urban areas. The election of a new West Bengal chief minister from the INC in March 1972 turned the tide on the urban Naxals. The law and order platform of Chief Minister Sid\u0002dharth Shankar Ray played out in a much more muscular police role across Kolkata and its surroundings throughout mid-1972 and into mid-1973. Kolkata police apprehended Naxalite leader Charu Maumdar in July 1972, and he died in custody several weeks later. Naxalite lead\u0002ers across the city succumbed to increasing police and state paramilitary presence. By 1973 the main cadres of the Naxalites had been eliminated and were dead or behind bars.35 11 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In this first Naxalite insurgent phase, the national government followed a pattern that would be repeated in subsequent phases. It did not forcibly intervene in the beginning. In keep\u0002ing with the federalist framework of the constitution, the government in New Delhi left it to local and state officials in West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and other afflicted states to take their own security actions to stop the threat. In the late 1960s, these state and local responses were often inadequate and ineffective.36 The central government only engaged with security forces once it had a critical mass of army forces in the region for the 1971–1972 war with Pakistan over Bangladesh and when the President’s Rule special authorities were in place, which enabled the military the power to make preventative arrests, search premises without a warrant, and shoot to kill civilians. Once engaged, the slowly evolving national response became one featuring intense force and coercion, eradicating the violence without eliminating the insurgency’s socio\u0002economic preconditions. Second Phase, 1977–1994 India’s first wave of insurgent violence ended badly for this domestic left-wing extremist movement but did not eliminate the conditions inspiring the movement or all of those willing to hold to the Naxalite cause. The movement fractured into more than 40 separate small groups.37 Slowly—over the course of a decade—these groups began to remobilize and consolidate. Par\u0002ticularly in the southeastern Indian state of Adhra Pradesh, a new Naxalite organization called People’s War emerged. Its leader, Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, sought a more efficient structure to boost morale, recruitment, and funding. By 1978 Naxalite peasant revolts had spread to the Karimnagar District of Telangana and Adilabad District of Adhra Pradesh. The major grievance was unpaid wages. Second-wave Naxalite insurgents kidnapped landlords and forced them to confess to crimes, apologize to villagers, and repay forced bribes. By the early 1980s insurgents had established a stronghold and sanctuary in the interlinked North Telangana village and Dan\u0002dakaranya forests areas along the Adhra Pradesh and Orissa border.38 In 1985 Naxalite insurgents began ambushing police. After they killed a police sub-inspec\u0002tor in Warangal, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh responded by creating a special task force called the Greyhounds to establish control in the seven worst affected districts. An elite anti-Naxalite commando unit that still exists today, the Greyhounds were drawn from within the Andhra Pradesh police forces and given special treatment. A 2,000-strong force in 2015, the Grey\u0002hounds were given preferred payment and training—better than federal or state paramilitary forces. They were also highly supported by the entire state police force. The Greyhounds played a minimal role in combatting the Naxalites during the second phase of the Maoist insurgency.39 12 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In 1987 the Naxalite political party (People’s War) and other Maoist groups in Andhra Pradesh were barred from elections after kidnapped government officials were exchanged for Naxalite prisoners. The ban was briefly lifted in 1991. In December of that year, however, insur\u0002gent attacks increased. Affected states responded by establishing special laws that enabled police to focus on capture, detention, and extra-normal means of violence against Naxalite cadres— fighters and presumed supporters.40 Adhra Pradesh and Orissa invited additional central para\u0002military forces in Telangana to augment state and federal government security forces already there. Besides brute force, the state set up rival mass organizations to attract youth away from the Naxalites, started rehabilitation programs, and established new informant networks.41 The new counterinsurgency strategy reduced violent incidents, and nearly 9,000 Naxalites surrendered. Consequently in 1994 the ban on ostensibly moderate Naxalite political parties was lifted.42 The second wave of the Naxalite insurgency had been stopped. However, and as at the end of the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency, the socioeconomic conditions underpin\u0002ning Naxalism remained largely unchanged in many regions of eastern India. Third Phase, 2004–2015 From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s the Naxalite insurgency remained largely out of the public eye, but the movement had not gone away. Taking advantage of rising local support for violent response to economic conditions, fragmented Naxalite groups created a united front: the People’s War, Party Unity, and the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) combined to form the People’s War Group (PWG). Naxalism manifested itself in episodic spurts of violence by the PWG, which had its most pronounced presence in Adhra Pradesh. From 1999–2002, local level violence increased. The PWG accelerated attacks on state government locations in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Chhattisgarh. By 2000 an estimated 3,000 armed Naxalite rebels were re\u0002portedly active in India’s east.43 During this time, Indian government agencies took actions that accelerated grievances among the poor and displaced with sympathies for left-wing violence. First, economic growth and development led to local and state government appropriation of land for infrastructure and resource development, displacing many underprivileged people who had no political voice. Second, governments responded to Naxalite violence with acute violence, reportedly includ\u0002ing the extra-judicial murder and torture of suspected rebels and rebel families.44 The MCC intensified its campaign of violence against Indian security forces and government agencies in 2002–2003 after its leader was killed by police.45 13 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In 2004, the PWG was superseded by the CPI-M.46 From this 2004 merger of the two larg\u0002est Naxalite factions—the PWG and MCC—into the CPI-M, Maoist ideology was fused with a cadre of armed groups for the first time.47 A third and more lethal wave of violence—more sophisticated and more destructive—rapidly spread throughout eastern India. Naxalite leaders expanded control over natural resource rich areas (for example, coal, gas, precious minerals, and timber). They also collected taxes and extortion money to fund weapons production, including the production of crude but effective improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Estimates from 2004 to 2011 suggest the Naxalites extracted at least $18.4 million annually from government offices, contractors, businessmen, and industrialists.They embarked upon more choreographed terror campaigns including the murder of local politicians, overwhelming attacks on local police sta\u0002tions, impressment of child soldiers, and a general campaign to scare away outside investors. By the second half of 2005, Naxalites demonstrated a lethality and reach far beyond the capacity of other domestic terrorist and insurgent groups. They destroyed buildings, captured weapons, and killed several local policemen in an attack on a village in Uttar Pradesh. They also attacked the Jehanabad Prison in Bihar, killing two, freeing more than 300 inmates, and abduct\u0002ing about 30 inmates who were members of an anti-Naxalite group. Total deaths from Naxalite\u0002attributed insurgency and terrorism grew to more than 800 in the impacted east and north\u0002eastern regions.48 In 2006 and 2007, this trend expanded. In 2006, Naxalite groups launched several high-profile attacks against civilians and security forces, expanding the rural territory under Maoist control and under threat of extreme violence. In one event, an attack by some 800 armed Naxalites in Chhattisgarh killed 25, injured 80 more, and saw some 250 people declared missing.49 In 2006, the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh grew concerned about the mounting threat posed by Naxalite groups to internal stability and democratic traditions across the east and southeast of India. The Naxalite menace had grown such that 18 of India’s federal states and 194 of its total districts were effected by Naxalite violence. For the first time Prime Minister Singh called the Naxalite/Maoist insurgency and associated terrorism “the sin\u0002gle biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”50 In 2007 Naxalite and Maoist violence reached an apex where it would remain for the next 4 years through 2010 (see map 2). Over 971 Naxalite attacks were recorded in the first seven months of 2007. That number would grow to over 1,500 attacks by the end of the year (see table51). Left-wing extremists began target\u0002ing elected officials including a member of the Indian parliament from Jharkhand state and the son of a former chief minister (or governor) of Andhra Pradesh.52 By 2010 the Naxalites were active in nine Indian states and reported to have a strong foot\u0002hold in parts of seven: West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, 14 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 and Maharashtra. This region happened to sit atop tremendous iron ore, coal, and aluminum deposits as well as irrigation and hydroelectric power potential. Across these states there were more than 2,200 incidents of Naxalite violence and almost 1,200 killed in 2010 alone (table).53 Map 2. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2007 15 India’s Naxalite Insurgency The threat to Indian national interests became obvious to the federal government and more co\u0002ordinated actions followed. From 2005 through 2010, Naxalite violence and the insufficient state-led, federally sup\u0002ported efforts to counter it cost India an average of more than 700 deaths per year. Most of these individuals were classified as civilian (see appendix A). Recruited from the disaffected rural poor, Naxalite cadres grew by 2010 to an estimated 20,000 armed fighters and an additional 50,000 supporters.54 In 2010, as he had first done in 2006, Prime Minister Singh trumpeted the risks of Naxalite violence to the stability and the ever important economic growth for the country. In May of that year, Prime Minister Singh referred to Naxalism as the “biggest internal security challenge” India has ever faced.55 The national government was understandably frustrated. From January to June 2009, India witnessed over 1,100 Naxalite-generated incidents of violence. These would double by the end of 2009 (table). Major violence occurred during national elections held from April to May 2009 as Naxalites called for an election boycott, attacked polling places, set off land mines, and even took control of a region of West Bengal known as Lalgarh. Paramilitary and police response operations against Naxalite locations were largely unsuccessful.56 Naxalite atrocities gained national notoriety. But simultaneously, accusations of systematic local police brutality and local and federal police human rights abuses against innocent civilians grew more vocal throughout the affected zones.57 In 2010 Naxalite violence inflicted 9 separate states of India and over 200 individual districts.58 Year 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 All Incidents 1,088 1,091 1,136 1,415 1,760 2,212 2,258 1,591 1,565 1,509 1,608 1,533 Attacks on Police 118 155 143 135 131 230 250 192 N/A 210 194 N/A Total Deaths 251 280 376 321 532 1,138 907 648 650 685 846 636 N/A = specific data not available Sources: “Left Wing Extremist (LWE) Data,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of Naxal Violence During 2008 to 2012,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of LWE Violence During 2011 to 2016 (up to 31.03.2016),” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; Government of India Ministry of Home Affairs, “Annual Reports,” available at. Table. Major Incidents During Naxalite Insurgency, Third Phase 16 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In March 2010, after months of prevarication and confusion, the national government launched Operation Green Hunt. The initiative added an additional estimated 20,000 federal paramilitary troops, mainly from the CRPF battalions, to existing state, local, and already pres\u0002ent Ministry of Home Affairs forces from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Border Security Forc\u0002es, and Shashastra Seema Bal.59 (See appendix B for detail on MHA special police units.) The operation sent federal, state, and local police and paramilitary forces into former no-go zones deep in the forests of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra states to rid them of militants, but these operations struggled. In April 2010, Naxalite insurgents ambushed 80 troops of the Indian Cen\u0002tral Police Security Forces (CPSF) in Chhattisgarh, killing an estimated 75 in the worst attack on Indian security forces since the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency began.60 In February 2011 Naxalites kidnapped two Indian government officials, demanding a halt to Green Hunt. The government agreed. The Naxalites also demanded the release of seven top imprisoned lead\u0002ers in exchange for the two officials. After a May 2011 Naxalite attack, 10 bodies of policemen were found dismembered in dense forest.61 Despite the major setbacks of 2010–2011, Indian federal and state authorities made some headway against a Naxalite insurgency now generating international headlines.62 Better coordi\u0002nated joint federal-state anti-Naxalite security operations killed a prominent Naxalite military leader, Koteswara Rao, in a November 2011 operation. In 2012 government paramilitary and police operations in West Bengal and Chhattisgarh began to produce results, with more than 1,800 Naxalite insurgents reported arrested and another 440 surrendered during the year.63 In late 2012 several Naxalite regional military leaders were captured and killed in those provinces. Acts of extreme violence continued during 2012 and 2013, but the expanse of the insur\u0002gency began to abate. Insurgency-related fatalities declined in 2012 and remained below 400 in 2013 (table). West Bengal reported sharp declines in Naxalite presence and activities dur\u0002ing 2013, although some observers declared that the decline in those states was offset by a corresponding increase of Naxalite violence in neighboring states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Orissa (appendix A). The Naxalites began the practice of including booby-trapping the bodies of dead Indian soldiers with IEDs in their stomachs. They killed national Congressman, and an\u0002ti-Naxalite militia Salwa Judum founder, Mahendra Karma in an attack on his convoy while he was campaigning for election in rural Chhattisgarh communities. Prime Minister Singh called for a two-pronged approach to dismantle the Naxalite network: sustaining joint and proactive military operations with greater economic development and responsible governance programs in the areas with strongest Maoist support. The CRPF successfully launched a 5-day interstate offensive in late December 2013 to dismantle core Maoist groups.64 It shut down a gun manu- 17 India’s Naxalite Insurgency facturing factory and recovered numerous weapons and explosives. Remote triggering devices were also found, indicating that the insurgency was using more advanced weaponry. By 2014 fatalities from Naxalite violence dropped below 300 for the first time in more than a decade (table). Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh remained most affected by the violence, and some Naxalite groups conducted operations and expanded into southern regions of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka states. But a review of the map in 2013 of Naxalite-impacted areas revealed a significant drop in the overall number of affected districts since 2007—from 165 to 120 overall—and an even more significant drop in districts categorized as experiencing severe or moderate amounts of violence from Naxalite activities over the same period—from 69 dis\u0002tricts in 2007 to just 28 in 2013 (see map 3). Eighty percent of Naxalite violence now afflicted only three states of India, down from the nine states impacted by serious Naxalite violence in 2010. On balance the tide had turned. By the end of 2014 the Naxalite insurgency was down if not out.65 In 2015, Indian joint security and economic efforts to counter the remaining Naxalite threat focused on 30 key districts in these 3 most impacted states, enabling more concentrated efforts matching gradually applied paramilitary enforcement with legal reforms and develop\u0002ment activities.66 As in the first two waves of Naxalite insurgency, the Indian federal-state government dis\u0002connect hampered its counterinsurgency efforts throughout the 2000s. Under the Indian con\u0002stitution, states bear the responsibility for enforcing law and order. When required, however, the federal government can send police and—under more limited conditions—military troops. In the case of federal police, assistance can come only upon request from the state government. In the case of military troops, assistance can come in the event of a state of emergency declara\u0002tion—as during the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency. Throughout the period from 2000 to 2010, the federal and state home (interior) ministries supervised multiple police and intelligence agencies without much unity of effort or command. An operation against Naxalite groups in the state of Bihar early in the 2000s faltered. Federal paramilitary border security forces in seven districts helped the local police, and millions of ru\u0002pees were promised in economic development opportunities. But the economic promises were broken, and poorly coordinated security operations only further alienated Naxalite moderates, derailing hoped for results by early 2002. In advance of 2004 elections in Chhattisgarh, the fed\u0002eral government sent 180 companies of paramilitary forces armed with helicopters and other advanced equipment. The Naxalites disappeared. Once the elections were over, federal troops and equipment departed and the Naxalites returned. 18 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 From the 2004 merger of Naxalite groups, the Indian government, particularly at the federal level, applied both carrots and sticks, incentivizing insurgents to pick constitutional remedies and brutally punishing those who refused. But the splits between state and federal authorities limited effectiveness. In part, state and local governments saw themselves in a co\u0002nundrum; they wanted an end to the organized Naxalite violence targeting them, their infra\u0002Map 3. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2013 19 India’s Naxalite Insurgency structure, and their legal enforcement structure. However, they did not want to alienate the vote banks across their states who sympathized with the Naxalite view of economic injustice but did not actively participate in violence. In one notable but far from unique instance, the chief minister (or governor) of the Naxalite-wracked state of Jharkhand won election in 2009 with strong insurgent sympathizer and insurgent vote bank support.67 State-level leaders de\u0002sired greater economic support from the central government, not overwhelming force, as the primary means to redress deeply held communist sympathies in their vote constituencies. Na\u0002tional political leaders within the INC empathized with these state-level concerns, offering some economic support and some additional policing support—but too little of either to make significant headway prior to 2010–2011. The politics of left-wing issues and voter concerns made effective coordination of counterinsurgency versus the Naxalites difficult. It took the extensive violence and loss of life between 2007 and 2010 to demonstrate the failure of an ill-coordinated approach. In 2009 the central government signaled that it wanted to provide 80,000 paramilitary and federal police to help in the fight, but these were too slowly fed into the region without strong local coordination. From the desperation of the peak year of Naxalite (CPI-Maoist) violence in 2010, and then–Prime Minister Singh’s second declaration that Maoist violence was India’s most grave internal security threat, a combination of state\u0002level requests and federal-level policy improvements paved the way for late-arriving successes against the Naxalites.68 The path to success was also paved by corresponding Naxalite failures. Beginning in 2010, the Indian federal government finally undertook several successful ini\u0002tiatives that slowly but steadily spanned the coordination gap between federal and state security forces and linked with improved local economic development aid.69 First, the government took steps to increase the costs to Maoist insurgent group operations—both financial and physical. Second, the central government deployed an additional 66 federal paramilitary security battal\u0002ions, CPSF and others, into the field where the insurgency had been winning against small and poorly trained local police. As noted above, these came slowly and in tranches between 2010 and 2014 but reached an impressive number of more than 200,000 by early 2014.70 India’s mili\u0002tary and its special operations forces (SOF) have not participated directly in the third phase of Naxalite counterinsurgency operations. Instead, SOF units have provided indirect assistance— offering specialized training to Indian Central Armed Police Forces (see appendix B) preparing to deploy to the anti-Maoist counterinsurgency fight.71 Third, the federal government built 444 new police stations in affected areas and regenerated the policing capability in them.72 Fourth, the government established a civil development program in the worst affected areas. Finally, government security forces worked more effectively in a combined action environment where 20 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 economic development and human rights were established in the communities most vulnerable to Naxalite recruiting and propaganda.73 These five national factors interacted with several organizational failures by the Naxalites themselves. First, the Maoists failed to generate a message of systematic economic exploitation to the degree necessary for serious attention in Indian urban areas, where the gulf between rich and poor was great and growing every year. Second, despite their highly publicized violence, the Naxalites never won the “mindspace” in India; the Maoist ideology of class conflict gener\u0002ated limited appeal outside of primitive and tribal areas in India, never resonating in urban ar\u0002eas other than with a marginalized group of activist university students.74 Indian youth moved onto other causes and other areas of activism in the wider Indian economy.75 Third, Naxalites proved to be their own worst enemies. They often splintered into criminal syndicates deal\u0002ing narcotics and running both extortion and kidnapping rackets. This profiteering, evident from as early as 2009–2010, revealed that Naxalism was less about communist ideology or well-coordinated violent insurgent activity and much more about local and regional organized criminal activity, which exploits rather than benefits the lower class (and lower caste) Indian Hindus who live there.76 In self-reflective statements, ministry-level officials in the Indian federal government ac\u0002knowledged that most Naxalite gains before 2010 had come too often because local govern\u0002ments and security officials incorrectly assessed and mishandled the problems of the disgrun\u0002tled Indian minority groups in rural areas. At the same time the central government remained tepid in its involvement—unable to induce state governments to request more assertive federal security assistance and caught in a political conundrum where some of the state government leadership was both courting Naxalite sympathizer votes while simultaneously fighting Naxalite militant cadres. Once the federal government got serious and increased paramilitary security presence with a wider number of local economic development programs, the Naxalites began to wane.77 Attention to a holistic approach by the Indian central government caused the worst of the Naxalite insurgency to recede in a visible manner.78 In 2016 the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India remains a security factor, but one far from the menace publicly announced by then–Prime Minister Singh in 2006 and again in 2010.79 Instead it is now much more of a nuisance, largely a constellation of organized criminal enter\u0002prises with a loose affiliation to a Maoist credo than an ideological insurgency. The socioeco\u0002nomic factors that inspire Naxalite groups remain in place, and this insurgency could again evolve into a more serious threat to local security agents in India. In the poor eastern districts of India, the possibility of a fourth wave of Naxalite insurgency cannot be dismissed if the rich 21 India’s Naxalite Insurgency continue to get richer without the benefits of economic growth filtering down to the people who really need it.80 India’s long slog toward corralling the third phase of its Naxalite insurgency again demon\u0002strated the challenges and strengths of its counterinsurgency framework. State and local govern\u0002ment police forces must fail obviously and admit to their failures before major federal assistance can come forward. Left-wing (or communist) inspired violence mixes awkwardly with Indian electoral politics in many eastern states of the country. Communist political party voters often sympathize with Naxalite grievances but not their violent means. State and local officials thus have incentives to take uncertain and indecisive action with their police and security forces. Too often, they can tolerate incompetence and even human rights abuses by local-level counterin\u0002surgency police and militias, exacerbating wider grievances. They appeal for national economic help while avoiding national security help out of a fear that too much outside intervention might harm their local political interests. Federal-level forces, when these do arrive, come with their own issues. They can lack local knowledge and fail to be sensitive to popular culture and traditions. This leaves them vulnerable to insurgent ambush and to charges of torture or human rights abuses from an uncertain or frightened local population. U.S. Security Engagement with Indian Ministry of Home Affairs U.S. engagement with India in the areas of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency has developed over a 16-year period from January 2000. This engagement has advanced along three parallel lines of interaction. One line has been through bilateral dialogue and exercises between U.S. and Indian SOF, which have focused on counterterrorism training events and conversa\u0002tions. A second line has been through collaboration between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Indian Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This collaboration has focused on criminal investigative techniques; port, rail, and maritime security training and best practices; and a general growth in liaison and information exchange between respective special police and border security agencies. A third line of interaction has evolved in more general bilateral military-to-military exchanges between the national armies, navies, air forces, and coast guards. Advancements in each of these areas have been noteworthy but not comprehensive. For all the noteworthy advances, limitations have remained, especially when it comes to the matter of outside assistance for Indian units and organizations conducting domestic counterinsurgency. The history of special operations training and exercising is most noteworthy. Bilateral U.S.- Indian SOF have undertaken joint exercises that work on interoperability in counterterror\u0002ism and counterinsurgency operation skills and drills. Small-scale counterterrorism training 22 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 exercises have been conducted on a recurring basis since 2002, including exercises in India’s northeast territories where longstanding domestic insurgencies continue.81 Under the broad definition of U.S.-India maritime security cooperation, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) SOF also have been training Indian military special forces officers in counterterrorism, learning from Indian counterterrorism experiences at the same time. In the main, these exercises have focused upon special techniques and capabilities for SOF activities in counterterrorism opera\u0002tions (see appendix C). Despite a decade of offers by U.S. senior commanders and defense officials, Indian leaders declined to have U.S. SOF engage with or provide direct assistance to the MHA paramilitary and police forces optimized for domestic counterterrorism or counterinsurgency operations.82 But in October 2015, India, for the first time, welcomed U.S. SOF to a joint training exercise with its MHA counterterrorism unit, the National Security Guards (NSG).83 This was a meaningful step forward and, as most observers believe, became possible only after the change in perspective ac\u0002companying the government of Prime Minister Modi. Yet the limit of U.S. SOF interaction with that of only the NSG—the single special police unit focused on counterterrorism rather than counterinsurgency operations—is telling. After more than a decade of U.S. offers, the Indian government still remains uncomfortable about direct bilateral counterinsurgency training with its large array of MHA domestic counterinsurgency forces. Washington and New Delhi first established the U.S.-India Counterterrorism Joint Work\u0002ing Group (JWG) in January 2000. Among more than a dozen major steps, the United States and India initiated antiterrorism training programs for Indian law enforcement officials and began a dialogue on cooperation in homeland and internal security.84 First, these programs involved lim\u0002ited military-to-military counterterrorism engagements. Then, after the November 2008 Mum\u0002bai terrorist attack, a more formal set of interactions between DHS and MHA counterterrorism and law enforcement officials began to take shape. Notably, however, neither of these lines of engagement have witnessed the MHA welcoming direct U.S. military or special police assistance for its special police or border police engaged in combating the Naxalite insurgency. In September 2005, USPACOM conducted a counterterrorism tabletop exercise that brought together Indian and American military, diplomatic, law enforcement, and humanitari\u0002an assistance leaders. A U.S. National Guard unit co-trained with Indian troops at India’s Coun\u0002ter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School in Mizoram. U.S. antiterrorism assistance advanced again after the November 2008 terrorist attacks in the commercial district of Mumbai. The U.S. Department of State’s Antiterrorism Assistance Program (ATA) provided enhanced training 23 India’s Naxalite Insurgency consultations with senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officials on the topics of hotel security, rail security, responses to an active shooter incident, as well as major event security management.85 In 2010, the two governments began the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. Since then the dialogue has enabled bilateral cooperation on mutual strategic interests and strengthened “security cooperation through expanded dialogues and exercises as well as shar\u0002ing of advanced technologies.”86 A subsequent 2010 U.S.-India Counterterrorism Cooperation Initiative allows the United States to facilitate capacity-building and training in India across a number of specific areas, including but not limited to: ■ developing investigative skills ■ promoting cooperation between forensic science laboratories ■ establishing procedures to provide mutual investigative assistance ■ improving capabilities to act against money-laundering, counterfeit currency, and terrorist financing ■ trading best practices on mass transit and rail security ■ increasing interactions between coast guards and navies on maritime security ■ exchanging experience and expertise on port and border security ■ enhancing liaison and training between specialist counterterrorism units, including the National Security Guard and its U.S. counterparts.87 Beginning in February 2012, American trainers under the ATA have been training Indian police in cooperation with the MHA. This training includes forensic examination of terrorist crime scenes and advanced explosives incident countermeasures. These courses are also available to state police, for example, in Kolkata (West Bengal). Intelligence agencies of both countries are sharing resources to support specific counterterrorism operations.88 These training courses have had a positive impact upon hundreds of Indian local and national police, including IPS. They have also engaged some members of the MHA special police units such as the Indo-Tibetan Bor\u0002der Police and CPSF. Noteworthy and prudent, these bits of individual training have occurred 24 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 with individual Indian police and paramilitary officers and jawans (junior paramilitary soldiers) who have later participated in counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites and other rebel groups.89 At the same time, though, direct U.S. military engagement with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and security forces units involved in domestic counterinsurgency has remained limited. American military interactions with regular Indian army units also have grown in an im\u0002pressive manner over the past decade. As discussed earlier, Indian, just as American, military and defense leaders are keen to state that India has more joint military training events and exer\u0002cises with the United States than with any other defense partner worldwide.90 Yet India’s civilian defense establishment leadership appears amenable to many military-to-military training and exercise interactions with the United States but continues to view access to military technology to be the litmus test of fruitful bilateral defense relations.91 Although the Indian military highly prizes joint service-to-service interactions and exer\u0002cises, no U.S. military units have been engaged with or even indirectly assisted Indian central police or paramilitary units directly involved in the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations against the Naxalites. In those instances in which the U.S. military and DHS per\u0002sonnel have had interaction with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and paramilitary forces, the rule has been that indirect general skills training is acceptable for Indian leadership, but specific engagement and activities directly with Indian domestic insurgency forces is alto\u0002gether something else. Some analysts have recommended that the United States formally inject direct domestic counterinsurgency assistance into the U.S.-India security relationship. In 2013, one such ana\u0002lyst, Haider Ali Hussein Mullick, made a robust proposal, stating that the United States should formally generate a $400 million India counterinsurgency initiative, jointly run by the Depart\u0002ment of Defense (DOD), State, and DHS.92 He proposed that this initiative should bundle to\u0002gether the indirect assistance provided by the ATA and DOD International Military Education and Training program, as well as establish a Foreign Military Finance Account for India (where one then did not exist) and apportion other money into DHS and Justice department accounts to better enable Federal Bureau of Information resources for its India-focused international po\u0002lice training program. In this well-intentioned recommendation, U.S. largesse could be used to provide vital equipment to India’s CRPF, including armored personnel vehicles, mine-resistant vehicles, flak jackets, GPS trackers, and night-vision goggles. As Indian attack helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were deemed vital for providing counterinsurgency ground 25 India’s Naxalite Insurgency support, this proposal provided for U.S. funding to assist the Indian air force in creating dedi\u0002cated air surveillance and support for the CRPF—including helicopter and UAV support.93 Noble in intent, Mullick’s recommendation of a major U.S. push to provide direct assis\u0002tance to Indian domestic counterinsurgency units and operations remains as misguided today as it was in 2013. Likewise, periodic offers by U.S. defense officials of direct U.S. military assis\u0002tance to Indian counterinsurgency forces are similarly well intentioned but off target.94 These and similar initiatives ultimately push unhelpfully against Indian protection of its absolute sov\u0002ereignty in domestic counterinsurgency operations. Moreover, even if India were to unexpect\u0002edly welcome direct U.S. military and whole-of-government support for its domestic counter\u0002insurgency activities, that very success would create significant problems for the growing but delicate U.S.-India security relationship. These problems are evident in the patterns observed during Indian counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites. Direct American support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations (such as those against the Naxalites) would quickly expose significant divergence between views in Washington and Indian cultural and political concerns with its domestic insurgents. First, In\u0002dians are historically tolerant of long, protracted counterinsurgency operations, including the four-and-a-half-decade Naxalite rebellion, a six-decade swirl of insurgency in northeast India, and the insurgency and rebellion extant in Jammu and Kashmir since 1947. American patience with such protracted counterinsurgency operations has not been a hallmark of its international ventures over the past century. Second, Indian domestic insurgencies have a political cadence and rhythm about them that is alien to American sensibilities. In all three phases of the Naxalite insurgency, state and local political dynamics played to Naxalite sympathizer vote banks, allowing insurgent activi\u0002ties to grow to an uncomfortable level. In the second phase and especially the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency, Indian national police and paramilitary assistance began with limited but targeted security help for local authorities that focused upon managing major events—like election security—but then quickly vanished. Only when the political calculus of local, state, and national officials aligned did coordinated and effective policing, paramilitary, and local as\u0002sistance programs come together. American patience with the dynamics of this Indian political rhythm would be sorely tried. Third, with much of India’s Naxalite insurgency featuring organized criminal activity as its underpinning by 2014–2016, it is arguably more useful and feasible for the United States and India to focus meaningful collaboration on individual policing techniques and investigative activities to counter these dimensions of residual Naxalism. There will be less Indian resistance 26 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 to this kind of DHS-to-MHA support. Thereafter, the focus of the U.S. military and its SOF can then better orient on wider regional and international counterterrorism activities. In addition to these historically supported cautions, direct American training and equip\u0002ment support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations might run afoul of U.S. legisla\u0002tive mandates and human rights standards. All U.S. assistance to foreign security forces must conform to what is known as the Leahy Law, named for legislative author Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). One part of the law applies to State Department foreign assistance programs and the second applies to DOD training and assistance programs for the security forces of a foreign country. Both versions prohibit any U.S. security assistance if the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense have credible information that a military, paramilitary, or police unit of a foreign government has committed a gross violation of human rights in the conduct of its activities— past or present. The law allows for an exception (or waiver) permitting resumption of security assistance if the Secretary of State or Defense reports to Congress that the government of the assisted country is taking effective steps to bring the violating members of the security forces to justice.95 Direct U.S. assistance to India’s paramilitary and police units combatting the Naxalite insurgency (as others) could quickly run into a problem with the Leahy Law. There have been frequent reports of Indian local police units’ involvement in human rights violations against innocents in the Naxalite insurgency areas.96 Indian central policy forces, including units from the CRPF, have been accused of human rights abuses and torture against apprehended militants and presumed supporters in Naxalite-afflicted areas.97 It is hard to imagine Indian pride react\u0002ing well to American demands for certification of the human rights corrections made on its national counterinsurgency paramilitary forces. It also is hard to imagine the U.S.-India security relationship holding up well if, in order to secure training and equipment for its already well-supported national paramilitary units, New Delhi must face repetitive Leahy Law inquiries. Indeed, in a country with growing wealth and a proud belief in the relative successes of its autonomous, indigenous paramilitary counterin\u0002surgency forces, U.S. direct assistance (with strings) is not likely to be well received.98 At the least, such conditioned assistance would strain security relations that both sides desire to see improve. At the worst, the outcome might set back bilateral security progress on far more im\u0002portant U.S.-India security initiatives including those involving joint maritime security activi\u0002ties in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean, interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence sharing and broader operations. 27 India’s Naxalite Insurgency Lessons Learned and Policy Implications for U.S.-India Relations A review of the history of Indian approach to dealing with its Naxalite insurgency indi\u0002cates the unique nature of New Delhi’s approach to domestic security. The limited engagement with the United States on military and security assistance offers also indicates the continuing barriers inhibiting a deep and unbridled bilateral security alliance at this time. A decade of U.S. interaction with India on the Naxalite insurgency reinforces the notion that Washington should not expect New Delhi to become a tightly coupled military ally anytime soon. Instead, New Del\u0002hi is more likely to be a friendly strategic partner with the United States where mutual security interests align, while interacting more often in a restrained and limited manner where U.S. and Indian security interests and prerogatives do not well align—as in the case of the Naxalites.99 Given this insight, U.S. policymakers should focus on bilateral counterterrorism and coun\u0002terinsurgency security cooperation efforts toward externally sponsored Islamist terrorist groups and, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, against actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns. As a complement, U.S. military assistance programs focusing on technical skills and practices for individual Indian police, paramilitary, and SOF will remain most promising and prominent for the foreseeable future. 28 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Appendix A.

Under the reciprocal agreement, both New Delhi and Washington would have the ability, but not the obligation, to assist each other’s armed forces with simple military logistics. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) would allow the United States to supply India with its proprietary encrypted communications equipment and systems, allowing secure peacetime and wartime communication between high-level military leaders on both sides. CISMOA would extend this capability to Indian and U.S. military assets, including aircraft and ships. The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) would set a framework through which the United States could share sensitive data to aid targeting and navigation with India.

On May 22, there were nearly simultaneous bombings of two movie theaters in New Delhi by a Sikh terrorist organization, Babbar Khalsa International, which many thought was defunct. The attacks left 1 person dead and more than 60 injured. On October 29, a series of explosions in crowded marketplaces and on a public bus in New Delhi killed approximately 60 and injured more than 150 on the eve of Diwali, India’s most important Hindu holiday. The Indian government blamed the designated foreign terrorist organiza\u0002tion Lashkar e-Tayyiba for the attack.

The slain Maoists were identified as Gautam Paswan, CPI-Maoist ‘Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee (BJSAC)’ member, who had a reward of INR 2.5 million on his head; Ajit Oraon _alias_ Charlis, BJSAC member, with an INR 2.5 million reward; Amar Ganjhu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; Ajay Yadav _alias_ Nandu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; and Sanjeet Bhuiyan, ‘sub-zonal commander’. During the search operation, the dead bodies of the five Maoists along with two AK-47 rifles, one INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, two other rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as items of daily use were recovered. On April 1, 2023, a CPI-Maoist cadre, Sameer Mohonda _alias_ Sadhu Linga (31), a member of the CPI-Maoist ‘Chatgaon Local Organizational Squad’, with a reward of INR 200,000 on his head, was killed in an encounter with C-60 Commandos in the Kiarkoti-Abujhmad Forest area of Bhamragarh _Taluka_ (revenue division) in the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra. Acting on intelligence inputs, the Commandos launched an operation and came under indiscriminate fire from a group of 60 to 70 Maoists hiding in the forest, who used Under Barrel Grenade Launchers (UBGLs) and other weapons. In the retaliatory fire, the C-60 Commandos killed one Maoist, while the others managed to flee into the dense forest. After the firing, which lasted for approximately an hour, the Security Forces (SFs) searched the area and recovered one .303 rifle, one gun, a country-made pistol, three magazines, 31 bullets, INR 38,000, medicines, Maoist literature and other materials. On March 28, 2023, a former deputy _Sarpanch_ (head of the _Panchayat_, village level local self-Government institution), Ramji Dodi, was abducted and killed by CPI-Maoist cadres in Zara village in the Narayanpur District of Chhattisgarh. Dodi was abducted, along with his two nephews, and taken to a forest where he was allegedly strangled to death by the Maoists. The nephews were released with Ramji’s body and a letter saying that he was killed because he was a ‘police informer’. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), there has been a total of 39 fatalities (20 civilians, nine SF personnel and 10 _Naxalites_, Left Wing Extremists) in Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-linked violence in the current year (data till April 9, 2023). During the corresponding period of 2022, the number of such fatalities was 49 (19 civilians, seven SF personnel and 23 _Naxalites_). Through 2022, there was a total of 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) in such violence. In the preceding year (2021), there was a total of 237 fatalities (58 civilians, 51 SF personnel, and 128 _Naxalites_). Overall fatalities were at 239 in 2020, 302 in 2019, 412 in 2018 and 335 in 2017. Overall fatalities have, thus, been on a decline since 2019. Moreover, the overall fatalities in 2022 were the lowest recorded in a single year since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE. Interestingly, the overall fatalities in 2021 were the pervious lowest recorded in a single year. A peak of 1,180 fatalities (630 civilians, 267 SF personnel, 265 _Naxalites_ and 18 unspecified) were recorded in 2010. As with overall fatalities, fatalities in 2022 in all three categories – civilian, SF and _Naxalite_ – were the lowest since 2000. A previous low of 58 in the civilian category was record in 2021. In the SF category, the previous low of 44 was recorded in 2020. A previous low of 87 in the _Naxalite_ category was recorded in 2004. Civilian and _Naxalite_ fatalities have also been on a continuous decline since 2019. SF fatalities have also declined through this period, barring 2021 (51 fatalities) when there was a spike compared to 2020 (44 fatalities). Other parameters of violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation relating to LWE activities across the country. The number of overall LWE-linked terrorist incidents fell from 676 in 2021 to 602 in 2022. In particular, incidents of killing came down from 124 in 2021 to 107 in 2022. Seven of the 107 overall incidents of killing were major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in 2022. In 2021, the number of major incidents was 15. Resultant fatalities from major incidents declined from 114 (seven civilians, 30 SF personnel, and 77 _Naxalites_) in 2021 to 22 (one civilian, three SF personnel, and 18 _Naxalites_) in 2022. In 2023, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents was 169, of which 32 were incidents of killing. Two major incidents have already been recorded in 2023. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2022, at 1:4.46, the best since 2000, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2021, the ratio was at 1:2.5. The ratio has remined in favour of the SFs since 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.61). In the current year, the kill ratio is in favour of the SFs at 1:1.11, so far (data till April 6, 2023). SFs arrested 395 _Naxalites_ in 2022, in addition to 409 in 2021, according to partial data compiled by SATP. In the current year, as on April 6, 2023, 122 arrests had been recorded. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, a total of 15,993 has been recorded. The mounting pressure on _Naxalites_ has yielded a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP, at least 2,855 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2022, in addition to 533 in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of surrenders was 97. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 16,581 LWEs have surrendered. Through 2022, SFs recovered arms from the Maoists in 190 incidents, in addition to 268 such incidents of recovery in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of such incidents are 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,694 incidents of arms recovery are documented. An analysis of over-ground and underground Maoist activities in the country’s LWE-affected areas also suggests a diminishing influence. According to SATP, in 2022, Maoist activities were reported from 10 States in comparison to 11 States in 2021. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 10 affected States have a total of 310 Districts, of which 58 recorded a Maoist presence. Of these 58, three districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 27 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 28 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2021, of 79 affected districts, one district fell in the ‘extremely-affected’ category, four in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 46 were ‘marginally affected’. Indeed, on March 28, 2023, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, in a written reply to a question in the _Lok Sabha_ (Lower House of the Indian Parliament), announced that the number of districts most affected by LWE had reduced from 35 in 2017 to 30 in April 2018, and then to 25 in July **[2021](https://pqals.nic.in/annex/1711/AU4464.pdf)**. Further, on March 28, 2023, the Government stated that the “geographical spread of violence has significantly reduced and only 176 Police Stations of 45 districts reported LWE violence in 2022, as compared to a high of 465 Police Stations of 96 districts in 2010”. Conspicuously, all major LWE-affected states across the country — **[Andhra Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-30)**, **[Bihar](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-31#assessment2)**, **[Chhattisgarh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-29#assessment2)**, **[Jharkhand](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-33#assessment2)**, **[Kerala](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-39#assessment2)**, **[Madhya Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-40#assessment2)**, **[Maharashtra](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-38#assessment2)**, **[Odisha](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-34#assessment2)**, and **[Telangana](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-37)** have witnessed an overall improvement in the security situation. Nevertheless, the Maoist challenge persists. OThe Perilous **[Bastar Division](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-22#assessment2)**, the safe haven of the residual Maoist problem not only in Chhattisgarh but across the entire LWE-affected region, comprising seven densely forested districts - Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur and Sukma - sprawling across 40,000 square kilometers, in the southernmost region of the state, is the location of the last Maoist bastions. On November 7, 2022, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar Range, Sundarraj P., asserting that the SFs were committed to wiping out the Maoist threat, nevertheless accepted, | | | --- | | In Bastar Range, though civilian killings have reduced to a great extent, from 279 in the year 2006, to 29 in 2022, it is still an area of major concern in left-wing extremist affected areas. | Indeed, on March 28, 2023, the Maoists abducted and killed two villagers, in Narayanpur and Sukma Districts, branding them as ‘Police informers’ (incidents mentioned above). Moreover, the early data for 2023 suggests that SF dominance on the ground, purely in terms of the kill ratio, has weakened during the first three months of 2023, as compared to the whole of 2022 and earlier. Not surprisingly, civilian insecurity has escalated. Disturbingly, more than a few deficits in the fighting forces remained noticeable in some of the worst Maoist-afflicted States, according to the _Bureau of Police Research & Development_ (BPR&D) data. BPR&D disclosed, as on January 1, 2021, that there were at least 28 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst affected State, that had no telephone. In Jharkhand, 47 had no vehicle, 211 had no telephone, and 31 had no wireless/mobile connectivity. In Andhra Pradesh, 65 Police Stations had no vehicle, and 34 had no wireless/mobile connectivity; and in Odisha, four had no vehicle, and three had no telephone. Moreover, large vacancies persist in the State Police Forces. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2021, against the sanctioned strength of 1,109,260 there were a total of 838,481 policemen in position in 10 LWE-affected States, leaving a vacancy of 270,779, i.e., 24.41 per cent. At the national level, deficits against sanctioned strength were 20.34 per cent, almost the same as the shortage in the Maoist affected States. The police-population ratio (policemen per hundred thousand population) of these 12 States had increased from an average of 138.63 in 2018 to 149.42 in 2019. Meanwhile, the all-India police-population ratio had increased from 150.80 in 2018 to 158.22 in 2019, significantly higher than the levels in the LWE affected States. Importantly, existing police-population ratios in these 12 states remained significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 183.97. At the national level, the existing levels were also significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 198.65 per 100,000. Moreover, the number of vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) of these 12 States was 595 (22.44 per cent), as against 948 (19.97 per cent) at the national level, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. These critical deficiencies in the enforcement apparatuses need urgent attention if the gains against the Maoists are to be consolidated further. The Maoists are down, but yet not out. The overall declining trend in Maoist violence and activity across the country needs to be contained with further security interventions with a sense of urgency, as the Maoists have shown incredible capacities for resurrection in the past, and retain substantial operational and overground capabilities in significant areas of their erstwhile regions of dominance. The SFs will have to overcome prevailing operational and capacity deficits, to prevent any rebel resurgence. | [Assessments Year

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with “unspecified casualties” on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi’s China and Modi’s India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China’s ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China’s abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India’s protest in denying Beijing’s claims as “exaggerated and untenable” is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi’s “clarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat”_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India’s active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China’s nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India’s nuclear strike range_** **_(right) – estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India’s national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China’s “containment of India,” the modernization of the PLA and its “growing assertiveness on the border”, and recommended a shift of India’s national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China’s unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or “string of pearls” that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India’s security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India’s peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China’s energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China’s power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China’s “Malacca dilemma,” by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing’s interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of “the quad”, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing’s ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India’s nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India’s boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India’s dismay. When BRI’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India’s doctrine of “strategic autonomy”. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek “equivalence” with the great powers — China, Russia, US — in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi’s party and support the base’s nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem “techno-nationalism”.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India’s dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India’s military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China’s relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. Commensurate to China’s 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a “peaceful rise” of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world’s longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India’s options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India’s strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India’s preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India’s “Neighborhood First” policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi’s ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal’s stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the “Asian Century” may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India’s geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide “chicken’s neck” connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China’s favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi’s strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India’s advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ”partners” with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh’s deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China’s border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its “like-minded partners” in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India’s diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war – for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India’s irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China’s assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-à-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, “wolf-warrior diplomacy”, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India – the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its “NORMS — New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System” approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India’s quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact – an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China – to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia – India’s soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter’s unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese “iron brother”, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China’s increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India’s disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled. In the _Art of War_, Sun Tzu posits, “a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.”\\[31\\] In their international positioning, whether it will be India or China’s thinking and preparedness that is victorious, only the real geopolitical battle will tell — one that far exceeds the LAC battlegrounds. * * * **References** [_**\\[1\\]**_](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/india-china-standoff-from-precarious-peace-to-the-point-of-no-return/?srsltid=AfmBOopMYRpkammY3JbuSv0VQLBVgNroFN1MwcBzigwT7ZYGZBeChO-Y#_ednref1) _Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas, New Delhi, November 29, 1996, United Nations Peacemaker, available from_( [https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%20IN\\_961129\\_Agreement%20between%20China%20and%20India.pdf](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%2520IN_961129_Agreement%2520between%2520China%2520and%2520India.pdf)).

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "“I have said in the past that left-wing extremism is the single biggest security challenge to the Indian state. It continues to be so.” – Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.[i] From Ideology To Warfare The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. Resurgence Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. A New Strategy “We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.” -Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. Overruns On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • Used improvised explosive devices. Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • Assassinated officials. In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • Destroyed police infrastructure. Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj Systems Disruption At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? The Deviant Economic Engine “The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.” -Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. The Revolutionary Tax In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. A Revolutionary Tax Economy To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • Mining. Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • Narcotics. India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • Informal tolls. Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. A Strategic Half-Life “It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they look to the Naxals for justice.” –Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base.

It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. Picture source: Depositphotos. _Prospects & Perspectives No. 28_ **The Shadow War: How the Pahalgam Terror Attack Redefined India-China-Pakistan Equation** By _Jagannath Panda_ The Pahalgam [terror attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl) of April 2025, executed by the Pakistan-backed group [The Resistance Front](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473) (TRF), was not merely another episode in the long-running saga of India-Pakistan hostility. It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. By and large, India’s reaction was strong, swift, and assertive beyond the border against the terrorist outfits harbored in Pakistan. The launch of [Operation Sindoor](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473), a precise military response targeting terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC), marked a defining evolution in India’s deterrence doctrine, pointing to a zero-tolerance strategy against terrorism. More than a tactical strike, it was a message — India will respond with resolve, not restraint, when its civilians are attacked. The operation drew clear parallels with the Balakot airstrikes of 2019, yet the context had shifted. The regional climate in 2025 is far more combustible, with trilateral tensions simmering in the Himalayas. The Pahalgam incident has exposed deep-seated fractures in the regional power matrix. China’s strategic posture in the aftermath — marked by conspicuous silence, selective language, and diplomatic hedging — underscores a growing contradiction between its self-styled image as a responsible global power and its operational behavior in South Asia. By refusing to acknowledge the terrorist dimension of such attacks or to pressure its close partner, Pakistan, Beijing reveals a troubling unwillingness to act as a genuine stabilizing force in the region. The contradictions in its stand are only growing and becoming more transparent to the world by the day. Is China truly committed to regional peace and stability, or is it bound by time-worn strategic alignments that prioritize geopolitical advantage over normative responsibility? Can a power that positions itself as an architect of global order afford to undermine its credibility by shielding a state associated with cross-border terrorism? What should be India’s strategic response to this shadow war? **Beijing’s Balancing Act: Neutrality or Strategic Collusion?** Following India’s retaliation, the world watched closely for diplomatic fallout. China’s response was a masterclass in studied ambiguity. Beijing termed India’s military action “ [regrettable](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202505/t20250507_11616523.html)” while conspicuously omitting any condemnation of the terror attack itself. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made [no mention](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/lxjzh/202505/t20250509_11618305.html) of the victims in Pahalgam, nor TRF’s Pakistani connections. Instead, Beijing’s focus remained firmly on urging “restraint” and “dialogue,” echoing a playbook that has often shielded Islamabad from international censure. This is not entirely a new behavior on the part of the Chinese leadership. Beijing has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the UN Security Council to [block designations of known terrorists](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slams-china-at-un-for-blocking-move-to-designate-2611-accused-sajid-mir-as-global-terrorist/article66993043.ece) based in Pakistan, including Sajid Mir, a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander involved in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008. This pattern of diplomatic protection underscores China’s strategic calculus: Pakistan is more than an ally — it is a linchpin in Beijing’s South Asia strategy and a buffer against Indian regional ascendency. What makes China’s stance especially problematic is its persistent refusal to differentiate between India’s counterterrorism actions and aggressive behavior. Chinese state media and official discourse frequently conflate Indian responses along the LoC with assertive conduct along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), crafting a narrative in which India is portrayed as a regional aggressor. This distortion allows Beijing to simultaneously align with Pakistan’s security outlook while maintaining a superficial neutrality. Moreover, China’s behavior mirrors its broader geopolitical approach: internal threats such as “Uyghur separatism” are met with uncompromising state violence, while external threats that affect neighbors like India are compartmentalized or ignored. The selective outrage is a window into Beijing’s dual standards on terrorism and state sovereignty. **Proxy Wars and Silent Partners: Redrawing the Diplomatic Map** Beyond the rhetoric, Beijing’s alignment with Pakistan is rooted in hard interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the crown jewel of Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This infrastructure project is not just about roads and pipelines — it’s about strategic depth. Any Indian challenge to the territorial status quo threatens both Pakistan’s and China’s investments, thereby sealing the logic of Beijing’s indirect complicity. This complicity extends into the diplomatic arena. In multilateral forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China has consistently [blocked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/human-rights-must-be-respected-india-after-skipping-xinjiang-vote/articleshow/94713915.cms) Indian attempts to highlight Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism. Instead, China promotes counterterrorism frameworks that align neatly with its own domestic narratives, especially those concerning Xinjiang, while conveniently avoiding issues that implicate Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues its [strategic silence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/22/asia/imran-khan-xinjiang-axios-intl-hnk) on China’s repression of Uyghur Muslims, despite its self-styled image as a champion of the Islamic world. This tacit exchange of blind spots — on terrorism and human rights — has become the bedrock of the Sino-Pakistani axis. And India, despite walking a tightrope on sensitive Chinese issues like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, has received no reciprocation in the form of diplomatic neutrality or support. The geopolitical geometry is clear: while India and Pakistan battle over borders and ideology, China plays the dual role of facilitator and firewall for Islamabad. Whether in backchannel diplomacy or in global institutions, China consistently acts to dilute pressure on Pakistan, reinforcing a strategic triangle that disadvantages New Delhi at every turn. Beijing’s deliberate omission of Pakistani provocations and cross-border violence in its Operation Sindoor response press briefings suggests a calculated strategic posture. This silence reflects China’s continued alignment with Pakistan, indicating that broader geopolitical considerations outweigh any immediate concerns about regional instability. By not publicly addressing Islamabad’s role, China signals its intent to preserve and prioritize its long-standing strategic partnership with Pakistan. **A Call for India’s Strategic Realignment** In this increasingly tangled web of interests, India must reassess its China doctrine. The idea of Beijing as a potential stabilizer in South Asia has little basis in reality. Instead, China has shown a consistent willingness to prioritize its strategic partnerships and investments over regional peace or normative alignment against terrorism. One avenue for India is to adopt a strategy of normative reciprocity. If China insists on referring to Jammu and Kashmir as a “disputed territory,” India could begin more openly addressing Chinese sensitive issues, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and potentially even Taiwan, revisiting its “One China” policy. Until now, India has largely upheld a principle of “mutual sensitivity” regarding core sovereignty concerns. While China has been increasingly assertive in internationalizing the Kashmir issue — whether through UN Security Council interventions, statements aligning with Pakistan, or selective cartographic provocations — India has avoided reciprocal commentary on China’s sensitive regions. This asymmetric restraint has allowed China to shape narratives unchallenged, while denying India the same deference on issues central to its national unity. Engaging Taiwan more openly — especially on trade, technology, and democratic solidarity — aligns India with other democracies like the U.S., Japan, and parts of Europe that have gradually normalized unofficial ties. Strengthening ties with Taiwan also offers India access to high-end manufacturing, especially in semiconductors, where Taiwan’s TSMC dominates global supply chains, critical for India’s tech and defense sectors. A closer India-Taiwan dynamic could be used as part of a broader Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance Chinese assertiveness in the region, especially when coupled with defense dialogues like the Quad. Explicit moves on Taiwan would likely provoke strong diplomatic and possibly economic retaliation from Beijing. This could take the form of border pressure along the LAC, trade restrictions, or cyber disruptions. Any move on Taiwan would have more impact if coordinated with partners like the U.S., Japan, or Australia. A unilateral shift may yield limited strategic gain while exposing India to disproportionate costs. It is therefore imperative that India must continue to invest more robustly in multilateral and minilateral coalitions that exclude or counterbalance China, such as the Quad, the India-Japan-Australia trilateral, and enhanced EU engagements. India’s aspiration to be recognized as a major international power, including in the “Global South,” depends not solely on its material capabilities but also on its normative influence, particularly in shaping global discourses on terrorism. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, New Delhi may need to recalibrate its approach by intensifying collaboration with global norm entrepreneurs, including middle powers across Europe and Asia, as well as transnational civil society and multilateral institutions. Moreover, India’s leadership roles in forums such as the G20 and BRICS present strategic platforms through which it can reframe regional security narratives and assert its vision for counterterrorism norms. Domestically, India must prepare for the long haul. The possibility of a coordinated two-front scenario — with Pakistan engaging in asymmetric warfare through proxy actors and irregular tactics and China providing strategic and diplomatic cover — is no longer hypothetical. Preparing for this evolving threat environment requires India to adopt a comprehensive and long-term security posture, encompassing military modernization, institutional resilience, and societal preparedness. Enhancing border infrastructure, upgrading intelligence and surveillance capabilities, and fortifying strategic deterrence must be non-negotiables in India’s defense roadmap. Sustaining a prolonged state of readiness requires a resilient defense-industrial base, robust supply chains, and financial planning. India must continue reforms to reduce dependence on foreign arms imports, incentivize indigenous R&D, and create strategic reserves for critical materials. Further, building robust logistical networks, especially in border states and high-altitude regions, will improve troop mobility and sustain long-term deployments. Civil-military synergy in infrastructure projects such as roads, airfields, and telecommunications along both western and eastern frontiers is essential. The shifting threat landscape demands that India move beyond reactive postures. Both Pakistan and China are adept at leveraging information warfare and disinformation to influence public opinion and sow discord. India must invest in counter-disinformation capacities, strategic communication, and public awareness campaigns to build regional and societal resilience against foreign psychological operations, where Taiwan could emerge as a stronger partner. New Delhi must significantly enhance its capabilities in narrative warfare — a strategic effort to shape perceptions, control the discourse, and influence international opinion. This involves not only countering adversarial narratives but also proactively framing its own story in a manner that resonates with global audiences. India’s case against Pakistan-based terrorism, as well as China’s tacit support through diplomatic silence or selective framing, must be articulated with clarity, credibility, and moral authority. To be effective, this narrative must be disseminated across multiple global platforms — from the United Nations and international media to think tanks, academic forums, and digital diplomacy channels — to expose the regional destabilizing roles of both Pakistan and China, and to align international sentiment with India’s security concerns and normative positions. The decision to send [delegations](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seven-all-party-delegations-to-take-indias-message-against-terrorism-to-key-partner-nations-government/article69586448.ece) to 32 nations is a strong first step. Publishing credible evidence, such as satellite imagery, financial trail disclosures, or intercepted communications, can further strengthen the factual basis of India’s narrative and pre-empt counterclaims. **Conclusion: Pahalgam as a Turning Point** The Pahalgam terrorist attack will be remembered not just for its human toll, but for what it revealed about the shifting tectonics of regional power complexities. It was a moment of clarity: India is not just facing a belligerent neighbor in Pakistan, but also contending with a cunning and double-standard power in China that is willing to obscure terrorism behind the veil of strategic self-interest. Increasingly, China’s actions — or calculated inactions — are rendering its strategic contradictions more visible to the international community, challenging the coherence of its South Asia policy and weakening its claim to impartiality in regional conflict resolution. The path ahead for India requires more than conventional military readiness; it calls for a fundamental reassessment of the strategic assumptions underpinning India's approach to China, particularly regarding Beijing’s role in shaping, enabling, or deferring regional crises. New Delhi’s challenge is two-fold. It must deter asymmetric threats from across the border, and it must decode and counteract the quieter, more insidious enablers of that threat. That means not just stronger borders, but sharper diplomacy. Not just better arms, but better arguments. Narrative warfare, if conducted strategically, allows India not just to defend its position but to shape the global agenda on terrorism and regional order, reinforcing its claim to normative leadership as a rising power. Pahalgam may have been a tragedy for India, but it is also an inflection point. A new foreign policy realism must follow. Because in this geopolitical theatre, the shadows are as dangerous as the swords.

India has seen a sharp rise in cyberattacks over the last few years, which has turned data protection into a top security concern. According to **CERT-IN,** between **2021 and mid-2025,** India recorded more than **2.2 million** cybersecurity incidents, averaging more than **3,000 attacks per day,** with financial services, healthcare, telecom, and government platforms among the hardest hit. Hackers focused on cloud misconfigurations, unpatched servers, and weak internal access controls. The list below tracks **25 major cyberattacks in India** from 2021 to 2025, showing how they happened and what strategies can be used to prevent similar breaches. ## **1\\. Angel One AWS resource breach/potential data leakage, February 2025** Angel One, India's largest broking firm, was recently hacked. Hackers gained access to an unsecured AWS storage bucket linked to it, exposing the sensitive data of **7.9 million** users, such as trading details, email addresses, and customer IDs. Cloud management made sensitive data visible on public servers. To avoid such scams, similar companies must audit all cloud buckets, enable encryption, and always restrict public access through IAM (Identity and Access Management) rules. ## **2\\. AI-generated Phishing and Infostealer Surge, 2025** In 2025, several Indian banks and fintech platforms reported a rise in AI-generated phishing scams. Attackers used a realistic, AI-written email to fool users into giving away credentials. Thousands have already fallen victim to these smarter phishing campaigns by unknowingly entering their bank credentials, leading to financial losses and identity theft. Attackers also used voice cloning and deepfake technology to impersonate officials, which makes the deception look more convincing. One must consider the fact that constant user training, spam filters, and AI-based email scanning tools block most phishing messages before they reach inboxes. ## **3\\. Aditya Birla Capital Digital (ABCD) App Hack, 2025** Hackers targeted a weakness in the ABCD mobile app API, revealing customers' loan and PAN details. The attackers targeted unprotected endpoints, which allows data scraping. API vulnerabilities remain a growing concern for finance apps. However, routine code audits with secure token validation and regular app updates can stop such data exposure. ## **4\\. Star Health Threats, May 2025** Star Health, one of India's largest health insurers, experienced a major data breach that affected 31 million policyholders; much of the core information, including medical records, insurance details, and personal information, was breached and even published on the dark web. This breach shows how healthcare data can be exploited for identity theft. Encrypting health records, segmenting sensitive systems, and ensuring continuous monitoring can reduce such risks. ## **5\\. Delhi Hospitals Ransomware Attack, June 2025** Delhi's **Sant Parmanand** and **NKS Super Speciality** hospitals were targeted by ransomware that locked almost all patient and billing data. Over **60,000 records** were affected by this attack. The attack used phishing emails to deliver ransomware payloads. The malware spread quickly through unprotected hospital networks. Hospitals should isolate administrative and patient data systems, train staff to identify suspicious emails, and maintain offline data backups. ## **6\\. Kolkata Police Cyber Crime Wing Data Breach, August 2025** Weak internal passwords and a lack of access control allowed hackers to access internal police systems, where investigation details from the Cyber Wing in Kolkata were leaked. This breach exposed officer credentials and case data. The attack raised alarms about insider threats and the need for stronger law enforcement cybersecurity. Police and law enforcement agencies should adopt role-based access control, enforce password rotations, and enable two-factor authentication for internal systems. ## **7\\. Multiple Cyberattacks on Indian Governments, 2024.** Multiple state e-governance portals were hacked in 2024, leaking citizen Aadhaar and bank details. At least **2.5 million** records were compromised across several platforms. Many portals lacked basic HTTPS encryption, which allowed attackers to exploit outdated plugins and weak admin passwords. That's why regular CMS updates, secure admin logins, and government-wide cybersecurity policies are vital for protection. Every e-governance platform must undergo quarterly vulnerability assessments and follow a national cybersecurity standard to protect public data. ## **8\\. Polycab Ransomware Attack, March 2024** Polycab India, a top cable manufacturer, suffered a ransomware attack, causing a **Rs 20 crore** operational loss. The breach started from an infected employee workstation and ended with hackers encrypting internal files and demanding high payments. The attack also affected the supplier and distributor network, exposing the ripple effect of industrial cyber incidents. ## **9\\. Indian Energy Sector Attack, 2024** This breach shows the exposure of operational technology systems, where hackers tried to infiltrate India's power grid through malware-infected email attachments sent to energy employees. The attack aimed to disrupt the electricity supply but was quickly contained. **Tip:** Separating IT and OT networks and constantly monitoring power infrastructure can prevent major outages like this. Moreover, conducting red team simulations and regular cybersecurity drills helps reduce the chance of large-scale blackouts. ## **10\\. BSNL Data Breach, May 2024** Personal details of **2.9 million** broadband subscribers were leaked from a BSNL database due to old, unpatched systems. Leaked data included phone numbers and service details. The breach came from a neglected internal server. The outdated system, left without proper monitoring, became an easy entry point. Updating infrastructure and restricting admin access can prevent similar service providers. **Read Also: [Top 30 Best-Known Cybersecurity Case Studies 2025](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-best-known-cybersecurity-case-studies)** ## **11\\. UP Marriage Assistance Scheme Leak, 2024** The Uttar Pradesh Marriage Assistance Scheme is a welfare initiative aimed at helping low-income families. Data from the welfare portal of Uttar Pradesh leaked, including Aadhaar, bank details, and contact information, affecting **200,000** applicants. The data was found indexed on search engines, shockingly. The root cause was traced to poor web server configuration and missing access restrictions. A web firewall and regular penetration testing could have prevented this from happening. ## **12\\. Airtel India Customer Database Leak (375 Million Users), June 2024** Hackers claimed to sell a database of **375 million** users, which would be nearly **25%** of India's population. Airtel denied the break, but the data was widely shared online. The leak included Aadhaar numbers and personal details. Even if false, it revealed risks from third-party data handling. Telecom companies must run vendor audits and apply zero-trust security across all databases, anonymising customer data wherever possible to reduce exposure if leaks occur. ## **13\\. WazirX Hack, July 2024** Crypto firms must use cold wallets for storage and conduct third-party code audits before deploying smart contracts. WazirX, a crypto exchange, was targeted by hackers who were exploiting blockchain smart contract vulnerabilities. Roughly **$230 million** worth of assets were at risk. This breach clearly highlights that public blockchain code, if left unaudited, can create hidden backdoors. ## **14\\. boAt India Data Breach, 2023** Encrypting user data and applying hashed passwords are key to securing e-commerce databases. In 2023, an unsecured server was recently exposed, exposing **7.5 million** customer records, including names and contact information. The leak spread on Telegram and hacking forums. Weak password protection made recovery even harder. Many users later reported spam calls and targeted ads due to leaked data. ## **15\\. Telangana Police's Hawk Eye App Data Breach, 2023** Hackers accessed the Hawk Eye mobile app, revealing user profiles and feedback reports. The app, meant for citizen safety, accidentally exposed personal data through a misconfigured API. Public-facing government apps should use token-based access, secure API gateways and regular security reviews before each software update. **Read Also: [Top 50 Cyber Security Projects for Final Year Students (2025 Edition)](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-25-cyber-security-projects-for-final-year-students)** ## **16\\. Hyundai Motor India Data Leak, 2023** Thousands of car owners whose contact and vehicle details were stolen were found on the dark web. The source of the breach was traced to a third-party vendor responsible for managing the dealer's database. Weak vendor access controls and outdated security measures worsened the system, risking identity misuse because the data appeared on dark web forums for sale. ## **17\\. SPARSH Data Breach, 2023** The Ministry of Defence's SPARSH portal suffered a breach, which exposed pensioner IDs and bank details. Hackers used credential stuffing techniques on weak passwords. This breach raised national security concerns as the portal handled sensitive military data. Multi-factor authentication, stronger password policies, and regular login behaviour analysis can stop similar attacks. ## **18\\. Sun Pharma Cyber Attack, 2023** Pharmaceutical giant Sun Pharma's ransomware disrupted its internal operations and supply chain, causing **Rs. 30 crore** in losses. Hackers entered through a phishing email and encrypted internal servers. Companies should train employees to identify phishing attempts, install anti-ransomware software, and maintain offline data backups for rapid recovery. ## **19\\. BharatPe Hacked: August 2022** Phishing emails led to a breach of employees' inboxes, leaking internal documents and financial reports. The attackers used social engineering to mimic trusted contacts, tricking employees into sharing login credentials. While no customer data was stolen, the breach hurt investor confidence. Using email MFA, spam filters, and awareness campaigns can block future phishing attempts. ## **20\\. Cyberattack on AIIMS: December 2022** India's top hospital, AIIMS, suffered a ransomware attack that took **3 million** patient records. The servers remained slow for approximately two weeks, which caused major disruption. **Read Also: [The Rise of Agentic AI in Cyber Warfare: Implications for Global Security](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/the-rise-of-agentic-ai-in-cyber-warfare-implications-for-global-security)** ## **21\\. CloudSEK Data Breach: December 2022** In 2022, hackers stole internal data from the cybersecurity firm CloudSEK and exposed API keys on **GitHub.** The breach revealed how even security companies can be vulnerable. Never use credentials in code repositories, and rotate all access tokens regularly. ## **22\\. Swachhta Platform Hacked, September 2022** Hackers breached India's Swachh Bharat (Clean India) platform, a government site that collected public sanitation feedback and cleanliness reports. The attackers took advantage of outdated CMS plugins and weak credentials, allowing them to deface the homepage and delete parts of the citizen feedback database. ## **23\\. Zivame Data Breach, 2022** In 2022, Indian lingerie retailer Zivame experienced an excessive data breach exposing personal and transactional information of nearly **1.5 million** customers. The data included names, phone numbers, email addresses and partially masked payment records. Investigators traced the cause to an unsecured database server left open to the public without password protection. The leaked dataset appeared later on dark web forums for sale. ## **24\\. Air India / SITA Passenger Data Breach, 2021** Recently, in 2021, a global cyberattack on SITA, the IT provider for various airlines, exposed personal data of over **4.5 million** Air India passengers, which included passport details, ticket numbers, birth dates, and contact information. The breach was traced to unauthorised access in SITA's passenger service system, which connected multiple airlines worldwide, compromising long-term passenger privacy. That's why airlines and travel companies must vet all external vendors for compliance with strict cybersecurity standards, enforce encryption for shared databases and deploy continuous threat detection across connected systems. ## **25\\. Domino's India Customer Data Leak, 2021** Hackers exposed nearly **180 million** customer order details, including their names, phone numbers and even GPS coordinates. Attackers used an unsecured server within the company's order-tracking infrastructure, and later they published the full dataset on the dark web. The exposed location information was essentially alarming, as it could reveal customers' routines and residential details. Companies handling location-based services should encrypt all customer data, mask stored addresses and set strict retention periods for order records. **Read Also: [Zero Trust Security: The Future of Cyber Defense](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/zero-trust-security-the-future-of-cyber-defense)** ## **In the End** India's cybersecurity reflects both rapid progress and rising exposure. Attackers have now shifted to multi-stage ransomware, insider misuse, and AI-generated phishing. Organisations that invested early in zero-trust controls, employee awareness programmes, and regular threat monitoring have contained incidents faster and have limited damage. Every sector, private or public, must treat cybersecurity as an **operational priority** rather than a compliance task tied to reputation, customer trust, and business continuity. ## **Frequently Asked Questions** ### **Which sector faces the most cyber threats in India?** The financial, healthcare, telecom and e-commerce sectors top the list due to their high data value. Banking APIs, digital payment apps, and hospital systems are common ransomware and credential theft targets. ### **What are the main reasons behind the rise in cyberattacks in India?** The main reasons are rapid digitisation, weak password habits, over-reliance on cloud storage without proper encryption, and phishing campaigns using AI-written messages. ### **How can individuals protect themselves from data leaks in India?** Use unique passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, avoid public Wi-Fi for banking, and never click unknown links in SMS or WhatsApp messages.

Shah](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/kriti-m-shah) _The citizens’ right to protest is a pillar of Indian democracy. While citizens are allowed to peacefully assemble, however, protests and demonstrations sometimes take a violent turn; recent examples are the Jat protests in Haryana and the Kashmir unrest following the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, both in 2016. During such occasions, it is the prerogative of the Indian state to deal with the violent civil protests in a manner that ensures public order and protects citizens from harm. This paper discusses the use of force by security officials during periods of violent civil unrest and seeks to understand the ways and means of dealing with such protests in the country._ ## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

Floods in northern India and Sikkim, coupled with **[tropical cyclones](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/cyclone-remal-bengal-coasts-top-updates-9353147/)** (TC) Biparjoy and Michaung, pushed overall economic losses for the year to $12 billion, well above the previous 10-year (2013-2022) average of $8 billion, global insurance giant Swiss Re said in a report. Economic losses in 2024 are yet to be calculated. ![](https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/default-ie.jpg) Swiss Re said the high losses were the result of disasters striking areas of large exposure and asset concentration.

The cyclone also impacted the neighbouring states of Maharashtra and Rajasthan, it said. [![Festive offer](https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/default-ie.jpg)](https://indianexpress.com/subscribe/upsc-special/?utm_source=IESITE&utm_medium=Banner&utm_campaign=Inarticle) Likewise, TC Michaung, which made landfall on December 5, 2023, brought extreme rainfall that caused large losses in [Chennai](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/chennai/). “Floods caused by heavy rains in northern India between July 10-15, 2023 impacted Himachal Pradesh, including the town of [Shimla](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/shimla/), and [Delhi](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/),” Swiss Re said. Story continues below this ad According to the Swiss Re, analysis of natural catastrophe-related losses in India over the last two decades shows that floods have accounted for, on average, about 63 per cent of total annual economic losses. This is due to the climate and geography of the country. “India is under the sway of summer monsoon from June to September, and northeast monsoon from October to December. Monsoon depressions generate extreme rainfall that in turn can cause severe flooding,” it said. Mahesh H Puttaiah, head insurance market analysis, Swiss Re, said, “the rapid pace of India’s economic growth has moved faster than actions taken to reduce the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes.” Since the turn of the century, several large flood events have caused economic losses above $ 1 billion. For example, the floods in [Mumbai](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/mumbai/) in 2005, Uttarakhand in 2013, [Jammu](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/jammu/) and Kashmir in 2014, Kerala in 2018, and northern India in 2023, all of which occurred during the summer monsoon. The Chennai flood in 2015 occurred during the northwest monsoon season, Swiss Re said. Story continues below this ad Gujarat, Maharashtra and [Tamil Nadu](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/chennai/) are the top three states in terms of industrial production, contributing 13.3 per cent, 13 per cent, and 10.5 per cent, respectively, to India’s total industrial output of $605 billion in 2023. “The major urban centres in the three states, respectively [Ahmedabad](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/ahmedabad/), Mumbai and Chennai, and their adjoining areas are major natural catastrophe hotspots, given exposure to multiple natural perils. So too is Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR). Gujarat appears to be most exposed to natural catastrophes as it experiences floods, [TCs](https://www.financialexpress.com/market/tata-consultancy-services-ltd-share-price/) and (occasionally) earthquakes. Tamil Nadu (Chennai) and Maharashtra are exposed to floods and TCs. Delhi is exposed to floods and earthquakes,” Swiss Re said. The report also indicates the extent of exposure to flood hazard (river flooding) and storm surge of the four major cities with large industrial clusters, seaports, and airports. Industrial clusters, and the transport infrastructure of Ahmedabad or Chennai specifically, can be very much in the range of harm if a **[cyclone](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/cyclone-biparjoy-what-is-a-cyclone-and-what-are-its-types-8659297/)** like Tauktae or Vardah occurs in near proximity. Story continues below this ad The report also mentions about the earthquake hazard: New Delhi and Ahmedabad are more exposed. “The impact from an earthquake with its epicentre in the Himalayas, but from which the ripples extend as far as Delhi or, alternatively, a smaller event with its epicentre close to a main city like Mumbai or Delhi, could result in losses that far exceed those that the 2001 earthquake in Bhuj, Gujarat would generate today,” the report warned. Many people, households and businesses in India are under- or uninsured, leaving them vulnerable to significant financial pressure when a natural catastrophe strikes, Swiss Re said. “Resilience building with insurance can be approached as a three-step process. The first step is granular hotspot identification,” it said. The second step is accurate assessment of risk accumulation, using state-of-the-art models based on granular and recent exposure data. Story continues below this ad The final step is designing appropriate re-insurance programmes to reduce underinsurance and natural catastrophe protection gaps, which currently stand at above 90 per cent in India, it said.

Today's spy doesn't wear a trench coat or sneak across borders — they slip into servers. A few lines of malicious code, a cleverly worded phishing email, and one careless click are enough to open a backdoor into power grids, defence networks, or corporate vaults. There's no gunfire, no alarm — just a silent invasion across cyberspace.Modern espionage no longer focuses on state secrets alone. It can paralyse ports, jam telecoms, empty bank accounts, and hold critical infrastructure hostage, all from thousands of miles away. Many of these attacks aren't random pranks but well-coordinated operations by advanced persistent threats (APTs) — hacker groups often backed by nation-states who monitor systems for months and even years — or by ‘Spider gangs', the global cybercrime cartels who chase profit, not politics.In Feb 2025, a hacker collective calling itself ‘Keymous+' targeted Gujarat's civic systems, according to FalconFeeds.io, a threat actor repository. The group overwhelmed the websites of Ahmedabad and Surat municipal corporations with fake web traffic in a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that crashed the portals for hours. Analysts found that Keymous+ boasted of 700 global attacks in 2025, 27.6% of which were govt entities while the rest ranged from finance and telecom to education. **You Can Also Check: [Ahmedabad AQI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-aqi-level-air-quality-index-today/3252) \\| [Weather in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-weather-forecast-today/380001) \\| [Gold Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/gold-rates-today/gold-price-in-ahemadabad) \\| [Silver Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/silver-rates-today/silver-price-in-ahemadabad)** But others aimed far deeper. In 2020, RedEcho, a group suspected to be backed by a nation-state, infiltrated India's power grid. They did not cause blackouts, but mapped out critical systems like the regional and state load despatch centres (RLDCs and SLDCs) — the nerve centres managing electricity supply — in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and several northern states. Cybersecurity experts at Recorded Future's Insikt group believe the hackers were creating digital \"backdoors\" — hidden entry points — \"to cause potential blackouts in the future\".Then came, TAG-38, another elite adversary sponsored by an enemy nation. Between Sep 2021 and March 2022, \"they targeted at least seven SLDCs in northern and western India, including areas near sensitive border zones\", states the Inskit group report. They cleverly hid their tracks by using hacked DVRs and IP cameras in Taiwan and South Korea to control their attacks remotely. These groups use advanced tools like ShadowPad (a modular malware that can be customised for different attacks) and remote access trojan (RAT) software that lets hackers control a computer from afar. They often get in through spear phishing — tricking someone into clicking a fake email link — or by exploiting weak spots in websites.India also faces threats from APT36 known as ‘Transparent Tribe', another group backed by an enemy nation and active since 2013. In March and April 2025, they disguised malware as updates on the ‘Pahalgam terror attack' to trick officials into opening infected files. They even created fake ministry of defence websites and used a sneaky trick called ClickFix, where malicious code is copied from a user's clipboard without them knowing.Meanwhile, SideCopy, another group, used fake social media profiles and phishing emails to target India's defence personnel. And APT41, also backed by an enemy nation, has been spying on India's healthcare and tech sectors, while also [hacking](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hacking) for money, even manipulating virtual currencies in online games.To combat such threats, Gujarat's science and technology department issued a circular this year, urging all govt employees to strengthen cyber hygiene. \"Do not share official photos or documents online, and never link work emails to personal apps,\" warned principal secretary Mona Kandhar. Officials were reminded that one careless click can compromise an entire department.The war is invisible, but it is already here. Every click, download, or forwarded file could be the entry point for a breach waiting to happen.

    "full_text": "# Red Sea Cable Cuts: Envisaging Operational Framework for Securing Critical Undersea Infrastructure - October 07, 2025 \\| - [Issue Brief](https://www.idsa.in/publication-type/issuebrief) ## Summary _India has vital stakes in ensuring the safety of the rapidly expanding Critical Undersea Infrastructure (CUI) networks across the Indian Ocean Region. To safeguard its CUI in future years, India must lead in establishing strategic and operational frameworks complemented by developing robust domestic capabilities._ In the first week of September 2025, several nations across West and South Asia, including India, experienced significant internet outages caused by severing multiple undersea cables in the Red Sea. Initial suspicions quickly turned towards Yemen’s Houthis rebels, who have been waging a sustained campaign of attacking commercial ships transiting the Red Sea. However, the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) suggested that the likely cause was accidental damage caused by commercial shipping activity. [\\[1\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn1) The September incident, though, marked the seventh instance of undersea cable damage in the region since the Houthis launched their campaign in December 2023. [\\[2\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn2) Even in their early stages of their campaign, the Houthis explicitly threatened to cut undersea cables in the Red Sea through social media channels. [\\[3\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn3) Yemen’s internationally recognised government has also repeatedly warned that the Houthis may attempt to damage undersea cables. [\\[4\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn4) In light of these facts, the potential involvement of the Houthis in past or future attacks on Critical Undersea Infrastructure (CUI) in the Red Sea cannot be ruled out. The incessant attack of the Houthis on commercial shipping has already led to the identification of the Red Sea as a High Risk Area (HRA) by various seafaring organisations. In this context, the growing threat to CUI, like internet cables, further undermines maritime security in a region that serves as a gateway to the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and will have implications for India’s strategic interests. Presently, the Red Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Taiwan Straits have emerged as global hotspots where severe damage to CUI has considerably increased, raising suspicions of possible subversive malicious activity. In January 2025, NATO launched a new multinational naval mission in the Baltic Sea, known as ‘Baltic Sentry’, to protect CUI from intentional sabotage. [\\[5\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn5) Assessing this mission can provide crucial insights into developing an operational framework for securing CUI in India’s maritime areas of interest. ## Critical Undersea Infrastructure in the Crosshairs CUI generally refers to the network of undersea cables and pipelines laid across the vast seabed, through which data and energy resources are transmitted. Since the first submarine cable was laid across the English Channel in 1850 to connect Britain and France via telegraph, undersea cable networks have become the nerve centre of today’s global world order. As of 2025, over 500 operational submarine telecommunications cables spanning over 1.7 million square kilometres worldwide, through which nearly 99 per cent of digital communications, including internet, telecom and financial transactions, are transmitted. [\\[6\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn6) These vast global networks of undersea cables are highly susceptible to damage by human activities in the underwater environment, such as deep-seabed mining and bottom trawling. Accidentally damaging these cables can lead to significant global or regional communication grid disruptions, affecting economic activities and national security. Besides cables, underwater oil and gas pipelines are also emerging as major arteries of global energy connectivity. They enable cost-effective transportation of large volumes of crude oil and natural gas across vast geographic distances. The sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline in the Baltic Sea in 2022 highlighted the threat posed to these underwater cables and pipelines from deliberate attacks by subversive state or non-state actors. Developing highly advanced deep-sea cable-cutting technologies by nations like China [\\[7\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn7) underscores the growing likelihood of CUI being targeted as a military tactic by state or non-state actors for waging grey-zone warfare. Three factors make CUI a convenient target for subversive attacks, whether by state or non-state actors. 1. **Unprotected Nature of the High Seas**: The vastness and ungoverned nature of the high seas in which these critical underwater infrastructures are located make them inherently vulnerable to subversion and sabotage. 2. **Ease of Execution**: These submarine cables and pipelines can be damaged by employing the most rudimentary methods. For instance, a perpetrator can use a commercial ship to deliberately drag its anchors over known submarine cable locations, thereby damaging them with minimal effort or risk. 3. **Anonymity & Deniability**: The vast expanse and remote locations of these critical undersea infrastructure allow the perpetrators to attack them with a high degree of anonymity. Also, a combination of factors, including the lack of governance of the high seas and the susceptibility of these installations to accidental damage by commercial shipping activity, provides plausible deniability to the perpetrators. As a result of these factors, over the past few years, there have been increasing instances of CUI being targeted and damaged by unidentified actors. This trend is particularly evident in maritime spaces near littoral regions experiencing conflict or geopolitical tensions, such as the Baltic Sea, the Taiwan Straits and the Red Sea. Since October 2023, there have been at least 11 reported instances of damage to submarine cables in the Baltic Sea. [\\[8\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn8) Taiwan, for instance, has been grappling with the issue of frequent undersea cable disruption, possibly caused by sabotage. Between 2019 and 2023, Taiwanese authorities reported 36 cases of submarine cables being damaged by suspicious foreign vessels. [\\[9\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn9) As of 2025, two incidents of undersea cable damage have already been reported, with indications suggesting possible intentional sabotage. [\\[10\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn10) In June 2025, Taiwan sentenced a Chinese national to three years in prison for intentionally damaging its undersea cable. This persistent threat has prompted the Taiwanese Navy and Coast Guard to launch 24-hour patrols on 11 September 2025 to continuously monitor the 24 undersea cables critical to Taiwan’s internet connectivity. [\\[11\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn11) ## NATO’s Baltic Sentry The Baltic Sea is a large semi-enclosed maritime space spanning nearly 3,77,000 square kilometres and is accessible through three narrow chokepoints. The ten littoral states of the Baltic Sea include Russia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland and Sweden. [\\[12\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn12) The Baltic Sea is a crucial corridor for global maritime trade as nearly 15 per cent of international container shipping transits through this region, which accounts for approximately 2,500 vessels daily. [\\[13\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn13) Additionally, the area hosts a vast network of CUI, including undersea cables and pipelines crucial for communication and energy connectivity between the Baltic region and Western Europe. Over the past few years, the Baltic Sea has emerged as a flashpoint of strategic tensions between NATO and Russia, especially after the latter’s actions in Crimea in 2014. Subsequently, these tensions have further escalated since the outbreak of the Ukraine War in February 2022. Since then, there has been a notable increase in damage to the undersea cables and pipelines in the region, raising suspicion of intentional sabotage. NATO has attributed these incidents to the activities of Russia’s so-called ‘Shadow Fleet’ operating in the Baltic Sea, thereby accusing Moscow of waging grey zone warfare by targeting CUI in the region. The term ‘shadow fleet’ has been used by NATO and the European Union (EU) to refer to Russia’s alleged use of commercial vessels to conduct shipping operations aimed at circumventing Western sanctions imposed after the outbreak of the War in Ukraine. The shadow fleet primarily comprises ageing commercial ships that operate on the high seas under the Flag of Convenience (FOC). This is a practice where vessels sail under a country’s flag other than their own. [\\[14\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn14) Additionally, these vessels are deliberately registered in a manner that presents dubious information regarding their ownership and operators. This makes tracing the origin and ownership of such vessels very challenging. Such vessels also have suspicious movements at sea, typically characterised by Automatic Identification System (AIS) blackouts, falsified positions, and transmission of false data and other deceptive techniques. [\\[15\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn15) These are the vessels that NATO has accused of indulging in the intentional sabotage of CUI in the Baltic Sea. NATO has substantiated this claim by citing the case of the oil tanker Eagle S seizure by Finnish Authorities in December 2024. While transporting oil from Russia across the Gulf of Finland, this vessel dragged its anchor along the seabed for approximately 90 kilometres. According to Finnish authorities, this caused damage to five undersea cables near Finland. [\\[16\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn16) To address this security challenge, NATO launched a coordinated naval operation, Baltic Sentry, on 14 January 2025, involving the navies of Germany, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland. This multinational operation aims to secure the CUI in the Baltic region by focusing on three key vectors, which are as follows: - **Establishing Deterrence through Conspicuous Naval Presence**: NATO aims to establish a sustained naval presence along key Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOC) in the Baltic Sea to deter suspicious actors from sabotaging CUI in the area. Operation Baltic Sentry essentially encapsulates a ‘deterrence by denial’ strategy. The forward deployment of NATO’s naval platforms is intended to create a posture capable of mounting a swift and robust response to any attempts to sabotage CUI in the Baltic Sea.[\\[17\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn17) - **Sustained Monitoring through Multi-Layered Surveillance**: In this operation, NATO has deployed various naval assets to enhance maritime situational awareness through multi-domain vigilance activity. [\\[18\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn18) The assets employed include surface ships, maritime reconnaissance aircraft, submarines and naval drones. Integrating aerial, surface and sub-surface surveillance enables NATO’s operational command centre to efficiently monitor critical SLOCs and vital areas of interest to detect suspicious activity.In July 2025, to further augment surveillance in this operation, NATO deployed several experimental unmanned systems in the Baltic Sea. These systems include Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs), and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), which have been deployed under Task Force X. Through these initiatives, NATO seeks to reduce operating costs for sustained operation effectively, bridge surveillance gaps, and aid critical decision-making, thereby minimising response time. [\\[19\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn19) - **Optimising Data Collation and Information Sharing**: The navies participating in Operation Baltic Sentry aim to streamline the collation of the vast amounts of data gathered from the diverse array of platforms deployed across the region. Integrating this data will significantly enhance their collective maritime domain awareness (MDA) and Underwater Domain Awareness (UDA) capabilities. This will enable them to accurately identify key zones of interest, including major shipping routes, critical maritime traffic junctions and the locations of CUI. Furthermore, NATO shares this information with other key stakeholders, such as allied navies, commercial shipping companies and regional port authorities. This is being done to facilitate the flow of intelligence inputs and improve overall maritime security coordination. [\\[20\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn20) This will significantly enhance the situational awareness of participating navies, enabling them to detect and respond swiftly to any anomalies or suspicious activities. In the nearly ten months since Operation Baltic Sentry was launched, there has been no notable instance of sabotage of CUI in the Baltic Sea. NATO Commanders have highlighted this as a testament to the operation’s success in securing CUI and deterring grey-zone warfare. [\\[21\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn21) In light of this, the potential of adopting a similar operational framework to safeguard CUI in the IOR must be explored, should the need arise. ## Envisioning an Operational Framework for the Indian Ocean Region The assessment of NATO’s Baltic Sentry prominently highlights that securing the vast maritime commons is beyond the means and capabilities of any single nation. Security on the high seas can only be achieved through collective efforts, as it enables resource pooling and ensures operations’ long-term sustainability. Such collaborative maritime security efforts are not entirely new to the IOR. Over the past two decades, the IOR has witnessed the deployment of several multinational naval task forces to combat security threats, piracy and terrorism, particularly in the Western Indian Ocean. Like NATO’s Baltic Sentry, the operational framework of these initiatives has been built on the fundamental pillars of presence, sustained monitoring and information-sharing. Several past and ongoing multinational naval operations in the IOR, such as Operation Ocean Shield and Operational Atlanta, have been based on an operational framework built around these three pillars. However, securing the CUI would additionally require the incorporation of an underwater element to any collective maritime security effort. This has been made evident through the assessment of Baltic Sentry, in which UDA has been a key element of its operational framework. Maintaining sustained underwater surveillance is a highly resource-intensive operation that involves the deployment of several aerial, surface and sub-surface platforms. To this end, the employment of UAV, USV and UUV in Operation Baltic Sentry presents a viable solution. Given the resource constraints regional navies face in the IOR, incorporating these emerging technologies to bridge capability gaps becomes essential to any potential regional effort to secure CUI. While the above measures play a crucial role in deterring and detecting acts of sabotage against CUI, it is also essential to establish clear rules of engagement. These rules, laid out as an operational framework, are necessary for guiding the interdiction and apprehension of vessels caught sabotaging CUI on the high seas. However, NATO’s Operation Baltic Sentry lacks such a framework, limiting the scope of its operations to deterrence and monitoring. In the absence of a defined operational mandate, the ability of any multinational effort to secure CUI remains inadequate, as challenges will rise in responding to sabotage in progress on the high seas. Additionally, Elisabeth Braw points out the inherent operational constraints of NATO’s Baltic Sentry arising from its reliance on purely military platforms. As a result, complexities are likely to arise when interdicting civilian vessels that may be used to sabotage CUI. [\\[22\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn22) In the IOR, this challenge can be addressed by incorporating enforcement strategies derived from existing operational frameworks, such as the Djibouti Code of Conduct (DCoC), which has been effectively used to combat piracy. Further, a robust enforcement mechanism in the high seas can only be achieved through integrating naval presence and surveillance with the elements of maritime law enforcement agencies, such as coast guards. A practical operational framework for protecting CUI in the IOR must rest on four key pillars: establishing deterrence through a credible naval presence. Second, sustained surveillance incorporating UDA is enabled by advanced technologies. Third, the facilitation of comprehensive information-sharing among key regional stakeholders. Finally, the development of robust enforcement protocols to guide the interdiction of vessels engaged in sabotaging CUI. ## **Securing the CUI in the IOR: India’s Stakes** It must be noted that India was among the many nations that faced increased internet traffic latency due to the recent Red Sea Cable cuts. This was because the two cable networks cut in this incident include the SEA-ME-WE 4 and IMEWE, which connect India to West Asia and Europe. Several of India’s leading Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including Airtel, Reliance Jio and Tata Communications, use these cable systems for internet distribution nationwide. [\\[23\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn23) Although these cuts did not cause widespread disruption, they serve as a stark reminder that the resilience of India’s communication networks is closely tied to the safety of undersea cables across the IOR. Also, this incident occurred when India was looking to expand its subsea cable infrastructure rapidly in the coming years. This was highlighted by the Chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), Anil Kumar Lahoti, in his speech during the Subsea Cable Systems Conference held in New Delhi in March 2025. He stated that India urgently needs to rapidly expand its cable landing stations (CLS) to meet its growing data demands and achieve its goal of becoming a global digital hub. CLS essentially serves as the gateway for data flow into the country, located on India’s coasts, where undersea cables are linked to terrestrial networks. Lahoti pointed out that India currently accounts for just one per cent of global CLS and emphasised that it must be expanded tenfold to meet its growing data demands. [\\[24\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn24) Apart from cables, India has been exploring options of establishing undersea gas pipelines for energy connectivity with West Asia for several years. As of 2024, a feasibility study was being carried out to establish an underground gas pipeline of around 1,200 kilometres between India and Oman at an estimated US$ 5 billion for directly importing gas supplies from West Asia. [\\[25\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn25) These developments clearly highlight how the security of CUI in the IOR is intricately linked to India’s national interest in the near future. Given these factors, India has vital stakes in ensuring the safety of the rapidly expanding CUI networks across the IOR. In a scenario where the safety of these CUI is endangered by intentional sabotage, India, as a key stakeholder in the IOR, has an inherent responsibility to lead regional efforts to safeguard them. To this end, India’s efforts to protect CUI must be built around two key areas: fostering regional cooperation and enhancing capability development. As brought out earlier, securing the vast networks of CUI across the high seas requires the pooling of resources and information sharing among the key stakeholders of a region. Therefore, in the future, India must focus on incorporating the operational components of CUI protection into its joint military exercises and coordinated maritime patrols with friendly foreign navies. Secondly, because safeguarding CUI is a tech-intensive process, India must prioritise investment in developing and acquiring indigenous UUVs and Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles (UWROVs), which are critical for enhancing the Indian Navy’s UDA capabilities. The Indian Navy’s recent contract with an Odisha-based deep-tech start-up for developing indigenous UWROVs indicates that India has already initiated efforts in this direction. [\\[26\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn26) Beyond strategic and operational frameworks, ensuring the resilience of India’s CUI networks requires building domestic capabilities, increasing private sector participation and formulating robust policy guidelines, particularly regarding undersea cables. These measures are necessary to create the necessary material capacities for undersea cable repairs in case of damage. This issue was prominently highlighted in India’s first International Subsea Cable Systems Conference. [\\[27\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn27) It must be noted that India does not possess cable-laying and repair ships. As a result, Indian network operators are forced to rely on foreign companies that own such specialised vessels to repair damaged cables in the undersea. The situation is further complicated by the complex bureaucratic process involving multiple ministries to permit these foreign vessels to operate in Indian waters. [\\[28\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn28) Hence, India must develop indigenous infrastructure, cable construction and repair expertise. This includes the acquisition of specialised cable-laying and repair vessels along with other related technologies. Also, to facilitate greater private sector involvement in this process, it is essential to offer targeted incentives and simplify complex policy guidelines. Overall, the recent incidents of cable cuts in the Red Sea serve as a wake-up call, highlighting the urgent need to develop operational strategies in the IOR to secure CUI against threats of grey-zone warfare in the underwater domain. India must lead in establishing strategic and operational frameworks complemented by developing robust domestic capabilities to safeguard its CUI in future years. _Views expressed are of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Manohar Parrikar IDSA or of the Government of India._ [\\[1\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_ednref1) Jon Cambrell, **[“Commercial Shipping Likely Cut Red Sea Cables That Disrupted Internet Access, Experts Say”](https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-undersea-cables-cut-internet-disruption-0b08fc5f02daf72710e0010c11ea21ae)**, Associated Press, 9 September 2025.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote7) Close footnote The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote8)The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote9)Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote10)The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote11)The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. Close footnote ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote12)The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote13)By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote14)Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote15) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote16)Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote17)In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote18) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote19)In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote20)In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote21)Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. Close footnote Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows. [22](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote22)Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote23)Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote24) Close footnote A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote25)Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote26)A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote27)ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively. This is despite widespread condemnation from independent human rights bodies and refrains from the judiciary.[28](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote28)Following bulldozer action in the aftermath of the 2023 Nuh riots, the Punjab and Haryana High Court questioned whether the targeted demolitions of Muslim houses amounted to “an exercise of ethnic cleansing … by the State.”[29](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote29) Close footnote ## **Toward a Hindu** _**rashtra**_ **?** Religious polarization is likely to get worse in the run-up to the elections, with the BJP well-positioned to benefit electorally from the consolidation of a Hindu voting bloc.[30](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote30)At a campaign event during the ongoing elections, Modi himself stirred up communal tensions by referring to Muslims as “infiltrators” and raising alarms that the opposition planned to redistribute the country’s wealth to Muslims, a claim that was widely dismissed as misleading.[31](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote31)A recent report by the Washington, DC-based India Hate Lab found that hate speech, mainly directed against Muslims, peaked during campaigning for Indian state elections in 2023; the BJP won three of the five states that went to polls.[32](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote32)Anti-Muslim sentiment in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots, where Hindu mobs reportedly killed hundreds of Muslims, also helped Modi, then the chief minister of Gujarat, remain in power for over a decade before propelling his rise to the national level.[33](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote33)Besides the ‘Hindi heartland’ states of North and Central-West India, which have historically seen high levels of communal violence, religious polarization can also be expected to drive an increase in violence in states such as Kerala and West Bengal, as the BJP seeks to capitalize on Hindu pride to expand its political footprint.[34](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote34)The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote35)The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. Close footnote A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote36)Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote37)For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote38) Close footnote _**Visuals in this report were produced by Ana Marco.**_ ## Footnotes 01.

By [Michael Fisher](https://www.itnews.asia/author/michael-fisher--1955979)on Oct 7, 2025 3:09PM The recent surge in cybersecurity incidents across the Asia Pacific region is now forcing a redefinition of what constitutes \"critical infrastructure.\" While energy grids, transport systems, and healthcare networks remain key targets, the latest attacks in aviation, retail, and financial services show that any network underpinning public safety, economic activity, or essential services can now be considered critical. In Australia, the Qantas breach exposed the personal information of over 5.7 million customers via a third-party system. In Singapore, nation-state actors like UNC3886 have been identified as actively targeting systems tied to national infrastructure. In India, ransomware has brought entire hospital systems and telecom providers to a standstill - disrupting care, communication, and public access. Even Google has now succumbed to a data breach. A growing concern is that this is not limited to large organisations. Cybercriminals are equally targeting small enterprises to gain access to larger corporate systems, as demonstrated by recent breaches of small to mid-size accounting and legal firms. These threats are also no longer confined to traditional IT environments, especially as digital and physical environments continue to converge. Operational Technology (OT) networks that are used to control machinery, industrial processes, and physical infrastructure are increasingly network-connected and vulnerable. Unlike IT systems, OT networks often lack built-in redundancy and can’t tolerate downtime, making them uniquely fragile in the face of modern cyber threats. > #### The increasing and high reliance on digital infrastructure across sectors like banking, retail, and logistics has elevated the criticality of their IT environments. A data centre failure or traffic outage can have the wide-ranging and same societal and economic impact as a disruption to water or energy supply. > > _- Michael Fisher, Regional Vice President, Asia Pacific and Japan, Garland Technology_ **The stakes are now higher than ever** As Singapore, India and Australia continue to digitalise core infrastructure and embrace smart systems, ensuring uninterrupted visibility across both IT and OT environments is emerging as a national priority for each country. Whether it’s a power grid in India, a port terminal in Singapore, or an airline in Australia, cyber resilience now depends on having the right architectural foundation – one that offers full visibility, supports zero-trust principles, and maintains uptime across the entire security stack. Governments and enterprises are realising the critical need for better network visibility, security and uptime that spans both digital and operational domains. This is because the next wave of attacks won't distinguish between IT and OT, so Asia Pacific organisations need to ensure their cyber defences are ready. **How can you bridge the IT–OT divide** Many organisations still depend on legacy security tools and operate without full packet visibility or the ability to monitor encrypted traffic. Even inline tools that are used to detect threats can create single points of failure if they’re not architected for continuous uptime. This vulnerability is amplified in OT, where patching or updates may require physical access to remote or sensitive facilities. A way around this lies in adopting highly resilient infrastructure that delivers real-time monitoring with zero disruption. This includes reliable network test access points (TAPs), network packet brokers, and hardware data diodes built for extreme operating conditions, along with inline bypass capabilities that ensure systems remain operational even when security tools fail or require maintenance. A good example of how this works in an organisational context is electrical utilities. As more electricity providers implement cybersecurity solutions inside substations, additional precautions must also be taken to protect infrastructure from sophisticated attacks. To address this, utilities need to look at: - Implementing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that passively monitors network traffic. - Ensuring that malicious code does not gain access to a substation’s network through the use of cost-effective hardware diodes and data diode TAPs. These provide an additional layer of security before connecting an IDS to a SPAN/Mirror port on a network. For example, a hardware data diode enforces unidirectional data flow so that information flows from sensitive environments, such as critical infrastructure, without the possibility of inbound threats. This one-way communication preserves the integrity of secure zones. There are situations where the use of SPAN/Mirror ports is still needed to connect the IDS to the substation’s network. In these instances, it is best practice to connect a hardware data diode between the SPAN/Mirror port and the IDS to pass the mirrored data onto the IDS sensor. This is because hardware data diodes eliminate bidirectional traffic flow, ensuring that no data is passed back into the Switch’s SPAN/Mirror port. In utilities and other key infrastructure, the use of inline bypass solutions is crucial in enabling organisations to update, test or maintain inline cybersecurity tools without taking them offline and risking exposure to potential cyberattacks. Inline bypass tools are also designed to ensure full network traffic visibility while minimising disruption during system updates and maintenance. With the line between what is and isn’t critical infrastructure continuing to blur, one thing is clear: future-readiness demands full-spectrum visibility, operational uptime, and the resilience to respond to the unexpected. The question that C-level executives of Asia Pacific organisations must now be prepared to answer confidently is whether their IT architecture is resilient enough to withstand a sophisticated cyberattack. _Michael Fisher is the Regional Vice President Asia Pacific and Japan, Garland Technology_ To reach the editorial team on your feedback, story ideas and pitches, contact them [here](mailto:editors@itnews.asia). © iTnews Asia Tags: [garland technology](https://www.itnews.asia/tag/garland-technology) [security](https://www.itnews.asia/security) ### Most Read Articles [**Malaysia secures communications for the upcoming ASEAN Summit**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/malaysia-secures-communications-for-the-upcoming-asean-summit-621220) [**Indonesia's national data centre suffers ransomware attack**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/indonesias-national-data-centre-suffers-ransomware-attack-609146) [**PhilHealth estimates 13 to 20 million members affected by data breach**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/philhealth-estimates-13-to-20-million-members-affected-by-data-breach-601471) [**Ransomware gang Qilin claims attack on Japan’s Asahi breweries**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/ransomware-gang-qilin-claims-attack-on-japans-asahi-breweries-620895)",

    "full_text": "### BW Communities # India Faces Highest Ransomware Threat In APJ Region: CrowdStrike Report [BW Online Bureau](javascript:void(0);) Oct 21, 2025 - [\\# Ransomware](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/ransomware) - [\\# India](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/india) - [\\# Cyberattack](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/cyberattack) - [\\# Cybersecurity](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/cybersecurity) - [\\# APJ](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/apj) Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

The report on international religious freedom released on Wednesday said that in 2023, senior U.S. officials continued to \"raise concerns about religious freedom issues\" with their Indian counterparts. Sign up [here.](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/us-religious-freedom-report-notes-violence-against-indian-minorities-2024-06-26/undefined?location=article-paragraph) Human rights experts say India has seen a rise in attacks on minorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently won a third term, and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \"In India, we see a concerning increase in anti-conversion laws, hate speech, demolitions of homes and places of worship for members of minority faith communities,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken [said, opens new tab](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-2023-international-religious-freedom-report-rollout/) when the report was released, in a rare direct rebuke of India. Criticism of India by the U.S. is usually restrained due to close economic ties and New Delhi's importance for Washington [to counter China](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-wishes-india-luck-with-structural-issues-strained-china-ties-2024-06-12/), political analysts say. The U.S. report listed dozens of incidents. Among them was a fatal shooting of a security official and three Muslims on a train near Mumbai by a suspect who was a railway security official. A probe by Indian authorities into that case is ongoing and the suspect was in jail, according to the Indian Express newspaper. The report cited examples of attacks against Muslims based on allegations that Muslim men were participating in the slaughter of cows or beef trading. The Indian embassy in Washington had no immediate comment. The Indian government denies [discriminating](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-will-talk-human-rights-rule-law-with-modi-2023-06-22/) against minorities, and says its welfare policies - like food subsidy schemes and electrification drives - [aim to benefit all Indians](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-modi-denies-stoking-divisions-win-election-files-nomination-2024-05-14/).

The State Department report also cited violence in the northeastern state of Manipur that started in May last year between minority, mostly Christian, Kuki and majority, mostly Hindu, Meitei ethnic groups. Hindu and Christian places of worship were destroyed in Manipur. Citing a local tribal leaders' forum, the report said over 250 churches were burnt down, more than 200 people were killed and over 60,000 were displaced. Hindus make up about 80% of India's 1.4 billion population. Muslims include 14% and Christians over 2%.

Formed from a 1967 split within the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the insurgency has been responsible for decades of violence throughout eastern and central India’s “Red Corridor.” These loosely affiliated Maoist rebels claim to fight on behalf of the landless poor, virulently opposing the injustice and oppression of the Indian state. In response to attacks on police officers, government officials, and landlords, India has employed an assortment of counterinsurgency strategies that, over the years, have met varied levels of success. As the modern Naxalite movement continues to develop, the Indian government faces new complications related to one of its most destabilizing internal security challenges. Adequately addressing this threat will prove essential in solidifying India’s status as a rising world power, as well as demonstrating its capacity to effectively combat militancy. #### Tags [India](https://csis.org/regions/asia/india),[Defense and Security](https://csis.org/topics/defense-and-security), and[Counterterrorism and Homeland Security](https://csis.org/topics/defense-and-security/counterterrorism-and-homeland-security) ### William Magioncalda",

The most notorious civil struggle has been the conflict with Kashmir insurgents, a border conflict between India and Pakistan that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The group was inspired by the agrarian revolution ideology as a means to achieve equality. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. The Naxalites are considered far-left radical communists and are declared a terrorist group under Indian law. In this report we will look into the Maoist movement in India, starting with its history. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group’s success and the global geopolitical consequences. **[View the full report](https://www.confluenceinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/weekly_geopolitical_report_10_28_2013.pdf)** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors.

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. India’s long-running class-based, economic insurgency—the Naxalite insurgency (or Community Party of India \\[CPI\\]-Maoist insurgency)—is a case study in which external security partnerships will remain limited, if not mostly unwelcomed, in New Delhi. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of domestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Washington would be ill-served by an Indian backlash to such unwelcomed assertiveness. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime security activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence-sharing and operations. The United States instead should focus on not only its offers of major near-term bilateral military assistance for security cooperation but also, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns in New Delhi and Washington.

    "full_text": "[Business](https://valorinternational.globo.com/business) 1 de 1 Reactor fire in Paraná disrupted electricity across Brazil for up to 2.5 hours — Foto: Divulgação/BombeirosReactor fire in Paraná disrupted electricity across Brazil for up to 2.5 hours — Foto: Divulgação/Bombeiros A fire at a power substation in the southern state of Paraná triggered a nationwide blackout in the early hours of Tuesday (14), highlighting structural vulnerabilities in Brazil’s electricity grid. The incident occurred at a reactor in the Bateias substation operated by Eletrobras, which is part of a 500-kilovolt (kV) high-voltage transmission line. The fire caused the shutdown of about 10 gigawatts (GW) of power. While some regions experienced only brief outages, others were left without electricity for over two hours. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met with Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira at the presidential palace just hours after returning from an overseas trip to discuss the incident. The blackout activated the Regional Load Relief Scheme (ERAC), a safety protocol that automatically disconnects parts of the system to prevent broader damage. Authorities downplayed the event and rejected the notion of a systemic crisis. Mr. Silveira called it a one-off infrastructure issue, saying Brazil’s national grid operator, ONS, responded promptly. - [Generation mismatch puts Brazil at risk of blackout](https://valorinternational.globo.com/economy/news/2025/09/22/generation-mismatch-puts-brazil-at-risk-of-blackout.ghtml) - [BNDES to review debt standstill requests from energy companies](https://valorinternational.globo.com/business/news/2025/10/14/bndes-to-review-debt-standstill-requests-from-energy-companies.ghtml) ONS said the fire severed the connection between the southern grid and the Southeast and Central-West regions, prompting a preventive supply cut across the country in varying degrees. The Ministry of Mines and Energy classified the incident as a “severe contingency.” In a statement, ONS said it began a coordinated response to restore power as soon as the situation was identified. Electricity was reestablished in the North, Northeast, Southeast, and Central-West regions within 90 minutes. Full restoration in the South took about two and a half hours. ONS Director-General Marcio Rea said in the statement that the agency quickly reestablished the system, “demonstrating the robustness of the National Interconnected System (SIN).” He described the event as a controlled power interruption caused by a “fortuitous incident,” the type of failure that could happen in any country. Eletrobras said the shutdown was triggered by a “reactor incident” and that power was restored shortly after. “ONS will determine what led to the larger disturbance in the national system. Eletrobras will collaborate in identifying the causes,” the company said. **System resilience** While experts acknowledged the system’s general robustness, the scale of the outage raised concerns. Luiz Carlos Ciocchi, former ONS director-general, said the blackout was “very different” from a 2023 incident that did not involve a fire. “The first question that needs answering is what exactly happened at the substation and why a fire in one component shut down an entire plant,” he said. Mr. Ciocchi added that the automatic protection scheme worked as intended, but further analysis was needed. “System security must always be a top priority in the power sector,” he said. He noted that the fire happened during low consumption hours and in a region without high renewable output. “The key is understanding what went wrong.” Power systems engineer Celso Torino pointed out that the 10GW outage was almost equivalent to power plant Itaipu’s capacity of 14 GW. “We need to better understand why a reactor fire at a 500kV substation caused the complete shutdown of 750kV lines connecting Itaipu’s 60-hertz output to Southeast Brazil,” said Mr. Torino, a former Itaipu operations director. “The N-1 security criterion tells us this shouldn’t happen.” He referred to the N-1 standard, which requires the grid to withstand the loss of a key component without triggering cascading failures. Mr. Torino said the episode calls for a broader governance review of the national grid, including planning, operational stability, and consumer cost structures. Carlos Adolfo Pereira, who heads the transmission division at the Brazilian Infrastructure and Basic Industry Association (ABDIB), said it was too soon to conclude there was a substation failure and a more detailed assessment was needed. He noted that the industry has been investing in modernizing transmission systems, especially replacing outdated equipment. “Transmission companies are expected to invest about R$40 billion through 2034 to upgrade old infrastructure,” he said. **“Reliability issue”** Edvaldo Santana, former director at energy regulator ANEEL and a columnist for Valor, said the blackout was one of the most significant in recent memory. The August 2023 outage cut 22.5GW of supply, while a 2010 failure involving Itaipu lines knocked out about 11GW. Mr. Santana questioned how a fire in a single reactor—typically considered a minor contingency—could affect the entire country, especially during low demand at around 12:30 a.m. “Even for a critical substation, a reactor fire should have been contained locally. This is a serious reliability issue,” he said. Industry sources described the Bateias substation as strategically important, part of a high-capacity 500kV line, but said it should have withstood the failure. The widespread impact indicates the system is “sensitive” to minor incidents, they said. Experts warned the event reinforces a troubling conclusion: Brazil’s grid remains “on a knife’s edge,” not due to energy shortages but because of a combination of structural weaknesses. These include fragile transmission infrastructure, equipment failures, excessive daytime solar generation followed by steep nighttime demand ramps, and networks that remain ill-equipped for extreme weather events. **Repeat of a known pattern** The event echoed a familiar pattern seen since the August 15, 2023 blackout. An ONS report blamed that outage on voltage control failures in wind and solar farms. Since then, the operator has adopted a more conservative management approach. Still, Brazil has experienced at least five major blackouts since then. Even minor incidents have had an impact. In August last year, a short circuit at an Eletrobras substation caused by a stray kite left 942,000 households without power in São Paulo and Guarulhos. Heavy rains also knocked down transmission lines and damaged dams in Rio Grande do Sul, while storms cut power to millions in the São Paulo metro area. In both cases, authorities struggled to respond quickly, leaving consumers in the dark for days. Specialists advocate for capacity auctions and technologies such as batteries and reversible power plants to improve grid resilience. “Until 2021, utilities invested R$18 billion a year. By 2025, that number will rise to R$46 billion. From 2025 to 2029, we expect R$235 billion in total investments, with 40% focused on modernizing networks,” said Ricardo Brandão, executive director for regulation at the Brazilian Association of Electricity Distributors (ABRADEE). The blackout comes just as Brazil prepares to transition from the dry season to the rainy period, which starts in November. There is still uncertainty over rainfall patterns and the recovery of hydropower reservoirs. Operational challenges are compounded by the rapid growth of renewables and pricing distortions that create additional costs for consumers and threaten the sector’s balance. Brazil narrowly avoided two national blackouts this year, one in April and another on Father’s Day, August 10. With low daytime demand, rooftop and small-scale solar generation surged to record levels, forcing ONS to disconnect large wind and solar parks to avoid overloads. Such incidents occur when the grid lacks infrastructure to carry excess generation, or when supply outpaces demand.

Currently, around 50 GW of renewable energy capacity remains stranded across India due to transmission bottlenecks, resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. India needs a comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap that incorporates cluster-level demand forecasting to anticipate emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs. Given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, India must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. Over the past decade, India has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy (RE), ranking third behind China and the US in installations and power generation. More than 71% of India's total installed renewable energy capacity, which stands at approximately [247 gigawatt (GW),](https://mnre.gov.in/en/physical-progress/) comes from solar and wind installations. This surge in clean energy generation, particularly from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources like solar and wind, is prompting a paradigm shift in power transmission dynamics. Power transmission is a critical component of the electricity value chain, and a robust and resilient network is essential for integrating the increasing RE capacity into the grid. Historically, India's power transmission network has been among the most advanced in the world, characterised by proactive planning and upgrades that have resulted in minimal congestion and strong operational performance. However, the significantly shorter gestation periods of VRE installations have left the transmission network struggling to keep pace with RE deployment. The result is a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of energy evacuation infrastructure. The diurnal and seasonal variability of VRE further complicates transmission planning, leading to stranded RE assets and underutilisation of transmission infrastructure. Currently, [around 50 GW of RE capacity is stranded across India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/indias-stranded-renewable-projects-double-to-over-50-gw-industry-documents-show/articleshow/123042172.cms?from=mdr), resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. The rising complications in VRE evacuation and its integration into the power transmission network have prompted power regulators to ramp up their transmission planning efforts. In September 2025, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) Chairperson Ghanshyam Prasad [reaffirmed](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/cea-revises-transmission-plans-every-six-months-for-600-gw-renewables-integration/124114939) the goal of integrating 600 GW of renewables into India’s power grid by 2032. He noted that to ensure seamless integration, the CEA has shifted to potential-based planning, adding that the plans will be revised every six months to reflect continuously evolving ground realities. Monthly meetings are also being held to expedite investment planning and prevent delays in approvals and execution. **Obstacles to an efficient power transmission system** Turning the increased planning efforts into actual implementation will require addressing the persistent challenges that hinder the development of green power transmission, like difficulties in land acquisition for right of way, and overseas transmission equipment procurement constraints, among other issues. Also, state-specific issues—such as Rajasthan's great Indian bustard (GIB) case concerning the critically endangered bird’s deaths from collisions with overhead power lines—further demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of delays that transmission network expansion can face, stretching gestation periods of transmission projects further vis-à-vis solar and wind. Rajasthan, in particular, is grappling with significant transmission bottlenecks, making it a hotspot of stranded RE assets. The primary reasons for this include delayed commissioning of transmission infrastructure, technical and ecological hurdles, and speculative grid access. As of July 2025, around 8 GW out of Rajasthan's 22 GW of operational inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected RE projects remained stranded. Additionally, these projects also faced generation curtailment of roughly 3.8 GW in the same month. These issues underscore the broader problem of rapidly developing geographically concentrated RE capacity without adequate planning and growth of evacuation infrastructure. The [Rajasthan government’s proposal](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/government-to-establish-2k-mwh-battery-storage-plant-for-solar-power/124316705?utm_source=top_news&utm_medium=sectionListing) this year to establish 2,000 megawatt-hour(MWh) of grid-scale battery energy storage aims to mitigate RE power curtailments and improve state grid utilisation. **The need for a strategic roadmap** A comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap is essential to ensure that Rajasthan and other RE-rich states can sustainably integrate future RE capacity additions. This roadmap should be target-oriented and timeline-bound with clearly specified deadlines and associated penalties. It should incorporate cluster-level demand forecasting by coordinating with state IT, industry, and urban development agencies to identify emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle charging (EV) hubs. Moreover, given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, the roadmap must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. The roadmap should also recognise the importance of energy storage systems (ESS). Critical in power generation and distribution, ESSs will also play a vital role in the green power transmission sector. At key transmission nodes, storage systems can provide valuable ancillary services such as frequency regulation, voltage stability, congestion management, and black start capabilities. The roadmap must incorporate and clearly specify the state-wise transmission-focused energy storage requirements. India’s power transmission sector is highly concentrated and averse to foreign and private sector investment. Encouraging participation and fostering an investor-friendly climate will be essential to build the requisite transmission capacity organically. Transmission planning and operations must leverage advanced forecasting, load-flow modelling, and real-time monitoring to enhance predictability and operational efficiency. Additionally, there is a need to move beyond conventional power purchase agreement (PPA) or merit-order based dispatch systems and transition to a security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) model. SCED optimises real-time generation schedules by accounting for constraints such as transmission limits, generator ramp rates, and reserve requirements. Ultimately, a modern and robust transmission network will form the invisible backbone of India’s power sector, one that is flexible, resilient, and fully aligned with the country’s long-term decarbonisation goals.

USAID @ The Asia Foundation LS FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE Improving Lives, Expanding Opportunities INDIA-U.S. TRIANGULAR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 01 The Asia Foundation, 2022, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey - Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. The Asia Foundation: New Delhi Disclaimer This report is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the ‘India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) at The Asia Foundation. The opinions expressed here are solely of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government and The Asia Foundation. 02 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Foreword India and the U.S. share a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region. India’s long\u0002standing engagement in the region makes it a strong development partner and leader. The Asia Foundation through its India- U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a program funded by USAID, is working toward realizing this vision and strengthening India’s and the U.S.’s development cooperation footprint in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The program builds on the U.S. government’s commitment to strengthen triangular partnership programs with India in the Indo-Pacific region and is informed by the U.S. government’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and its Pacific Islands Strategy. TriDeP seeks to support the Government of India’s development assistance in the Indo\u0002Pacific region by identifying countries keen to expand their development partnership with India in sectors defined by their country needs, and by supporting programming based on such identification. Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Smart Agriculture and Renewable Energy are sectors where India demonstrates policy leadership and technical skills, and thus can provide sustainable solutions. This report presents a diagnostic study that maps India’s capabilities in disaster management, as well as identifying opportunities for India and the developing countries in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and South Asia to partner for promising solutions. Over the years, India’s disaster management approach has evolved rapidly to respond to the slew of challenges posed by a range of disasters. India’s diverse geo-climatic conditions make it vulnerable to multiple natural and human\u0002caused disasters, thus prompting the country to develop tailored policies and frameworks for coordinated multi-stakeholder disaster-risk reduction efforts. TriDeP seeks to leverage India’s know-how in disaster management, by sharing technical expertise and knowledge and supporting local adaptation, to improve resilience and preparedness against disasters in the Indo\u0002Pacific region. TriDeP aims to do this in close collaboration with a range of stakeholders, including governments, communities, and the private sector, through cost-effective and context-specific solutions. This diagnostic identifies India’s expertise in establishing well-defined institutional systems; legislative, policy and planning frameworks; robust search and rescue capabilities; improved early warning systems; technological advancements for disaster risk management; improved emergency communication; expanded disaster resource and knowledge networks; emergency operations centers; enhanced response capabilities and systems; and post-disaster mental health management. The study also identifies opportunities for India-U.S. triangular cooperation across several countries in the Indo-Pacific region. While the diagnostic study was underway, the Covid-19 virus struck with severity unimagined in a century and has brought to the fore the disastrous dimensions of pandemics, including psychological and physical health challenges that require concerted medical responses to India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 03 address them. Several participants in a virtual meeting of experts from the Indo-Pacific region to discuss the study expressed interest in the knowledge and expertise of India in psychosocial care and telemedicine health services, both important focus areas that help to address pandemic-related health issues. I would like to thank Balaji Singh Chowhan, who is the lead author and researcher for this report and an expert in disaster managenment.

Sen Pilgrims being rescued from Badrinath after the 2021 Uttarakhand flood. 10 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey I ndia, due to its unique geo-climatic conditions, is vulnerable to multiple natural and human-caused disasters, such as droughts, floods, earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, hailstorms, cold waves, heat waves, glacier lake outburst floods, wildfires, oil spills, and other major pollution events. The country’s journey toward holistic and modern disaster risk reduction (DRR) practices began more than 20 years ago, when several natural disasters resulted in thousands of deaths and enormous economic losses. These disasters spurred India toward a more comprehensive DRR approach, eventually leading the country to tremendous disaster management progress: Subsequent disasters have resulted in minimized deaths and losses because of India’s effective DRR efforts. Over the course of the past two decades, India’s disaster management approach evolved from a reactive, search-and-rescue, and relief-centered approach primarily centered on flood and drought to a proactive, holistic approach that includes prevention, mitigation, preparedness, capacity building, risk reduction, technological investment and advancements, community involvement, and risk resilience for a far wider range of hazards. Holistic disaster management requires mainstreaming DRR into policies, institutions, infrastructure, and logistics in order to develop tools for effective and efficient action. India developed DRR policies for multiple stakeholders by integrating inputs from domain experts and all levels of governments and communities; it also increased response effectiveness through international coalitions, and coordinated risk reduction capabilities at the national and local levels. India’s holistic DRR efforts involve robust legal frameworks; effective policy design and development; domestic policy and institutional coherence; a focus on capacity building, expert input, and knowledge sharing; well-oiled administrative mechanisms; an ability to prevent or mitigate disasters before they occur, as well as effective and inclusive rescue and recovery operations. India’s disaster management learning curve owes a great deal to how India adapted crucial disaster management elements from other countries to India’s own context. Now, other countries have the opportunity to emulate India’s DRR journey in order to accelerate their own efforts, thereby saving thousands of lives and millions in economic losses. India has multiple bilateral and multilateral DRR relationships with other countries, such as the United States, Switzerland, Australia, Russia, the European Commission, and United Nations agencies. Given this international cooperation framework already in place and India’s extensive DRR capabilities, it would be hugely beneficial for India to branch out to additional triangular cooperation (TrC) initiatives, especially partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which already has a strong DRR backbone with India. These TrC initiatives would be led by India as the primary source of expertise and technical assistance and could also benefit from the involvement of several United States agencies and private-sector or nongovernmental organizations. India’s South-South development cooperation model would thus be considerably enhanced, with the triangulation of efforts between India and the United States increasing India’s development assistance footprint in the developing countries of the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. This report begins with an explanation of India’s 20-year journey from search and rescue\u0002related crisis management to prevention, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 11 mitigation, and preparedness, setting the groundwork for how India’s experiences can be adapted to other countries’ own disaster management contexts. The second chapter details the interplay between India’s DRR strategy, legislation, policy interventions, disaster management administration and institutions, and its perspectives on gender equity and social inclusion in DRR efforts. Chapter three breaks down how India can share its knowledge and DRR capabilities through the country’s multiple DRR technologies and capacity-building institutions, including centers of excellence for training in general disaster management and early warning systems; specialized institutions for search and rescue and disaster assessment, mitigation, and planning; private- and nongovernmental organization\u0002run training institutes; Incident Command System adaptations; risk communication and language adaptations; and equipment stocks and suppliers. The fourth chapter outlines the DRR status of three Indo-Pacific sub-regions: South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indo-Pacific Islands, and briefly discusses the potential DRR needs of ideal TrC partners. Chapter five concludes with a discussion about the viability of TrC initiatives, and makes recommendations for suitable TrC activities in 10 Indo-Pacific countries. About the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) India, The Asia Foundation is implementing the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a three-year program in support of the United States’ and India’s mutual aims in the Indo\u0002Pacific Region. In a ground-breaking initiative to catalyze North-South-South triangular cooperation (TrC) throughout an entire region – the Indo-Pacific – rather than with a single country, the TriDeP program will facilitate partnerships between India, the United States, and several South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Indo-Pacific Island countries.1 The TriDeP program has identified three priority areas where India can share its proven expertise: disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate-smart agriculture, and renewable energy. The TriDeP program team selected DRR for its inaugural research initiative to explore how and where India’s demonstrated DRR policy leadership, practical experience, and sustainable results can be shared with countries in the region. After assessing India’s DRR capacities and capabilities and matching them to the needs and capabilities of potential Indo-Pacific partner countries, the TriDeP program will develop demand-driven, context-specific TrC projects that combine Indian experience and Photographer: Saikiran Kesari Stranded citizens making their way through the flooded streets of Mumbai, India during the 2020 Mumbai floods. 12 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey expertise with Indian and American technical assistance, drawing on India’s centers of excellence, training institutions, relevant private sector entities, and nongovernmental and civil society organizations. Research Objectives The TriDeP program team undertook action research on India’s DRR institutions and capabilities in order to understand the Indian\u0002Indo-Pacific DRR landscape, identify DRR needs in potential beneficiary countries, highlight areas of India’s DRR expertise that could be shared, suggest priority partners and projects for initial TrC implementations, and determine suitable activities to support project design and implementation. Research Methodology The action research for this report took place from January through June 2021. The research process began with a thorough review of the literature followed by nine telephone and seven in-person interviews with 16 Indian government representatives, technical specialists, and practitioners experienced in DRR and disaster management in order to gain a preliminary overview of India’s current capabilities – what we will call the “supply-side” of DRR (see Annexure 1 for participant list). The study also involved extensive desk research to gather background information about India’s supply-side capabilities. The supply-side research also involved convening a group of 17 experts from India, including independent DRR experts, leaders of DRR civil society organizations (CSOs) working in India, and current and retired government functionaries who lead or have led India’s disaster responses. These experts were joined by six supporting Photographer: Dr. Ashok K A Doppler Radar meteorological geodesic dome atop a hillock at Vishakhapatnam, India. India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 13 staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 2 for participant list). The supply-side research was complemented by what we will call “demand-side” desk research about Indo-Pacific countries’ geographies and their disaster exposures, histories, institutional and technical capabilities, current disaster\u0002aid partnerships, and relevant socioeconomic profiles. The desk research was enhanced through discussions with a group of 39 experts in the fields of DRR and climate change impacts; these experts represented countries, states, or organizations from Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Germany, India, Nepal, United Kingdom, United Nations, United States, and international nongovernmental and civil society organizations. These experts were joined by seven supporting staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 3 for participant list). The demand-side experts discussed DRR needs as perceived by countries in the region, identified geopolitical interests or sensitivities, and postulated supply-demand matches. Since Covid-19 pandemic restrictions prevented in-person meetings, both supply- and demand-side convenings took place online and lasted about two hours each. During the demand-side convening, the Covid-19 pandemic prompted requests from some Indo-Pacific countries for assistance with health- and psychosocial-care needs to combat and counter the effects of the pandemic. Although the TriDeP team did not focus on pandemic disasters in the initial research phases, this report describes some of India’s supply-side telemedicine and psychosocial-care capabilities that could match demand-side requests for pandemic- and other health-related cooperation projects. Drawing on the desk research, interviews, and discussions with the TriDeP program team, and his own extensive experience in the field and personal familiarity with the actors, the author identifies 10 countries as potential TrC candidates and indicates their potential needs for equipment, services, and technical assistance that would increase the effectiveness of disaster risk management and response. In his selection of potential match countries, the author also considered complementary and competing DRR programs and activities already in progress with other providers. The author cautions, of course, that all DRR assistance proposals should align with host government priorities and that all recommended disaster management solutions must be fine-tuned and based on further contextual analyses. Pertinent facts about the 10 potential match countries and possible TrC initiatives are detailed in Annexure 4, which covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Fiji, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Maldives, the Philippines, Nepal, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. In addition, the author presents disaster risk profiles for 16 other Indo-Pacific Region countries that may become candidates for TrC in the future: Brunei, Cook Islands, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, and Vanuatu (Annexure 5). The author’s TrC recommendations are consistent with the Intermediate Result (IR) 3.1 of the USAID India Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS).2 The Asia Foundation is a non-profit international development organization committed to improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia. Informed by six decades of experience and deep local expertise, its work across the region addresses five overarching goals – strengthen governance, empower women, expand economic opportunity, increase environmental resilience, and promote international cooperation. The TriDeP creates an opportunity for The Asia Foundation to examine emerging cross-cutting critical issues, such as disaster risk reduction, that warrant deeper investigation to inform its program strategies to ensure the Foundation remains at the leading edge of changing dynamics in the regional context – geopolitical, environmental, and legal/regulatory – and well-positioned to tackle the most critical issues facing Asia.

To be effective, all these elements must come together as a seamless whole. The policies, institutions, and logistics of disaster management are as important as the actual equipment used to rescue people – absolutely vital in handling disasters, in reaching to the last mile, and in determining the tools for effective and efficient action. Equally important is the involvement of disaster management practitioners in policy design and development – the domain and subject matter experts who understand the complexity and who know how to make disaster management policies, institutions, and logistics work together most effectively. Effective disaster management usually requires a long phase of development; time is the main challenge in setting up vital elements. Experts see India’s present disaster management approach as a journey that lasted just over two decades. It began at the time of super Cyclone Photographer: Fernando Quevedo de Oliveira Forest fires above Thak village in Uttarakhand, India in May, 2016. 16 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey ‘The Government of India and other stakeholders implemented recommenda- tions from a High Powered Committee (HPC). ‘The HPC’s report guided India’s disaster managernent approach from a relief-centric approach to one that embrac- es prevention, mitigation, and preparedness. fo strengthen India’s approach, the HPC. also made other recommendations: linking development efforts to disaster reduction; estab- lishing a disaster knowledge network, promoting interna- tional cooperation; applying a national disaster mitigation strat adopting a commu- nity-based approach; and fostering a culture of preven- tive thinking, The enactment of the National Disast ment Act and the de lop- ment of a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and state- and district-level disaster n ‘ nt authorities (SDMAs and DDMAs) set the stage for India’s National Institute m of Disaster Management (NIDM) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 17 The National Policy on Disaster Management (2009) motivated community-based disaster management, last-mile integration of policy and plans, executional capacity development, consolidation of past initia- tives, deployment of best prs agencies at national and tices, cooperation with international levels, and multi-sectoral synergies. First announced in Novem- ber 2016 during the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, the Prime Minister's Ten Point Agenda restated DRR priorities, such as bolstering local capacities, enhancing, knowledge networks, and supporting international coalitions. The 2016 National Disaster Management Plan, subse- quently updated in 2019, provided a [ramework for disaster management plans at the ministerial, depart mental, state, and district levels. The Plan set out mechanisms for multiagency coordina- tion: the National Executive Committee (NEC), headed by the Ministry of Home Affairs Secretary at the national level, and the State Executive headed by a Chief Secretary mmiittee, at the state-government level.",

    "title": "India’s risk environment: tailoring your Business Continuity Plan",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "In the 2024 World Risk Report by Bündnis Entwicklung Hilft and IFHV, India ranks third globally for disaster risk, underscoring its high vulnerability to hazards such as floods, cyclones, and earthquakes. While the country is poised to grow at 6.4% GDP for FY 24-25 (PIB, Govt of India), approximately 60% of the country’s land area faces medium-to-high seismic risk, and 80% of its 7,500-kilometer coastline is exposed to cyclones or tsunamis. India is frequently subject to sudden weather- and climate-related disruptions that can damage infrastructure and business operations. These disruptions are driven by vast geography, complex climate conditions, pollution problems and dense population distribution – especially in the megacities. Repeated events have highlighted the fragility of key urban and rural systems that are closely linked to the natural ecosystem. Organisations operating in India must make a proactive, location-specific Business Continuity Plan. The impact of recent crises Natural disasters claimed 2,936 lives across India in 2024. The disasters, including floods and landslides, also led to damage to over 3.63 lakh houses and affected 14.24 lakh hectares of cropped land (data shared by the Indian central minister of state for home affairs in the Indian Parliament in January 2025). Earthquakes India is located in multiple moderate-to-high seismic zones, which, combined with high urban density, lack of earmarked assembly areas and building codes, means earthquakes are a persistent threat. Although there was no single large-scale urban earthquake in 2024–25, experts warn that even moderate earthquakes can cause extensive structural damage and pose severe challenges to business continuity. Cyclones, floods and landslides Cyclones striking West Bengal and Odisha in 2024 (Cyclone Remal) caused widespread damage, led to the loss of over 30 lives in West Bengal and the north-eastern parts of India, and disrupted industries ranging from agriculture and textiles to IT and retail, causing severe damage, supply chain breakdowns and workforce displacement. Similarly, floods in Assam, Andra Pradesh, as well as landslides in Kerala, led to loss of life, disruption to communication and business. Droughts, Water Scarcity, and Heatwaves Periodic droughts affect both northern and southern states, reducing agricultural yields and posing risks for water-intensive industries like textiles and food processing. Bengaluru, a rapidly expanding tech and business hub, faced its near “day zero” water scarcity situation in 2024 as urbanization outpaced infrastructure growth. Business continuity plans were challenged, as many employees moved to their hometowns and organisations struggled to balance their work priorities with employee welfare. Increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves are now straining power grids and outdoor labour conditions, fueling concerns over productivity, frequent and long blackouts, and supply chain risks. Many of these events, such as unpredictable monsoons, pollution and heatwaves have since become cyclic, posing new challenges for businesses which need to factor them in as part of their annual planning. Natural disasters are happening more often, with increased vigour and often simultaneously. A robust Business Continuity Plan is critical A well-designed Business Continuity Plan (BCP) helps organisations safeguard critical processes, protect employees, and recover faster when natural disaster linked disruptions occur. Effective BCPs outline key recovery priorities, communication strategies and fallback resources to minimise financial and reputational damage. In India’s volatile risk landscape, lacking a robust BCP can lead to lengthy downtime, irrevocable losses, and diminished stakeholder confidence. Despite these stakes, many companies remain underprepared. According to Think Teal’s 2024 State of BCDR, India report, which surveyed over 220 CIOs and IT decision-makers from large Indian enterprises across diverse sectors, nearly 40% of Indian businesses lack a detailed Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) strategy. Almost half of the respondents review their BCDR strategies only once every three years, and about 40% reported limited expertise in managing BCDR. Lack of a formal BCP and processes to manage disruptive events can create a culture where response is prioritised over proactive planning and readiness. From hazard-focused to resource-focused Traditional disaster preparedness often targets a single type of threat (like an earthquake) and prioritises physical safety measures. However, crises can easily cascade beyond their initial impact, rendering hazard-specific plans too narrow. Each organisation’s context, requirements and location-specific challenges are different and demand a bespoke approach to business continuity planning. As was witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, many other disruptive events continued whilst many parts of the world were already reeling under restrictions, leading to a “poly-crisis” (or a crisis within a crisis) scenario. In this context, simplistic BCPs were either ineffective or irrelevant. A more versatile, resource-focused approach begins by identifying critical organisational assets – human resources, facilities, information systems, supply chains and external partners – and assessing potential disruptions. By tailoring strategies to protect and restore each resource category, companies can adapt more effectively to both anticipated and unforeseen events, including compound or secondary hazards that emerge after an initial crisis. Localizing your BCP for India For multinational and foreign-based firms operating in India, customising a global plan is crucial. Key considerations include: 1. Risk-based scenario planning: Regional and cyclical India’s wide-ranging regional diversity and recurring environmental risks call for a dual-layered approach to scenario planning—one that addresses both location-specific hazards and cyclical disruptions. For example: Coastal areas may require cyclone evacuation protocols and surge- resilient infrastructure. Seismic zones should incorporate structural safety audits, retrofitting, and vulnerability assessments, along with investment in early warning systems. Urban centers such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi-NCR face recurring risks like water scarcity, monsoon flooding, and pollution- related restrictions. Each industry also faces distinct vulnerabilities. A micro-fulfilment eCommerce hub will have very different continuity needs compared to a multi-storey retail chain. To address these diverse risks, organizations should develop detailed continuity scenario plans supported by concise, actionable playbooks tailored to both geographic realities and business models. 2. Simplicity over volume Concise, action-oriented plans – tested regularly through drills, tabletop exercises, simulations or live tests –promote clarity and ensure that busy employees who have very specific roles within their companies understand their relevant roles and responsibilities when responding to an emergency, a disruptive event or a crisis. 3. Infrastructure Contingencies Large-scale power outages and communication failures can happen suddenly – triggered by cyclones, floods, earthquakes or landslides. Backup power, backup internet and communication tools, and clear local decision-making authority at the local level help sustain operations even when headquarters are unreachable. In extreme scenarios, organisations may need to suspend operations or evacuate employees. 4. Developing a culture of continuity Specific initiatives, such as leadership trainings and functional briefings, help teams understand and embrace the continuity plan and adapt it for their own use. Awareness campaigns can also support organisational change and organically root the initiative. 5. Inclusive Communication Not all frontline staff speak English or the parent organisation’s language. Multilingual updates – via text alerts or dedicated phone lines – ensure no one is left uninformed in an emergency. Having a copy of the instructions to be followed during an emergency in the local vernacular also helps during the incident and the emergency response phase. 6. Community coordination Collaborating with embassies, local industry focus groups and neighborhood associations can strengthen crisis response. Offering resources – like spare vehicles or facility space – builds goodwill and can accelerate area-wide recovery. Such collaboration also helps highlight common issues to government and civic bodies under a common umbrella for a faster resolution. Over time, mutual coordination and collaboration can prove invaluable during location-specific crisis situations. Moving forward Indian businesses now recognise the need for clear business continuity and climate change mitigation plans aligned with government disaster management programmes. A strong culture of preparedness – what UNESCO calls a “real and long-lasting culture of prevention\" – reduces disruptions and shortens recovery time. Given India’s exposure to natural hazards and global disruptions, resilient, regularly tested BCPs tailored to local realities are essential. Shifting from hazard-specific planning to resource-focused strategies enhances flexibility. Thorough risk assessments, inclusive communication, and community engagement help protect employees, minimise downtime, and ensure business continuity. In India’s fast-growing yet risk-prone market, a strong BCP safeguards competitiveness and long-term resilience.",

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india).

His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

However, the country’s power- transmission network has struggled to keep pace, leading to a clear gap between the generation and the evacuation infrastructure. The result? Over 50 GW of renewable energy capacity, enough to provide clean energy to 80-85 million households, cannot start operations and an extra 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide is being released daily into the atmosphere, all due to the lack of power cables and delays in the signing of power purchase agreements. Follow our WhatsApp channel Lapses on the transmission side can not only impact the environment and economic development, but also derail the country’s energy transition strategy. During the COP26 summit in 2021, India committed to installing 500 GW of non-fossil fuel based power capacity by 2030, with solar energy contributing the largest share at 280 GW, followed by 140 GW from wind power, with hydropower, bioenergy, and nuclear energy chipping in with the rest. So far, India’s progress has been significant. According to the latest data from Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), India’s non-fossil fuel capacity currently stands at 256 GW and is expected to reach around 300 GW soon, with over 40 GW of renewable energy projects in advanced stages such as signing power purchase agreements (PPAs) and securing transmission connectivity. Among the key drivers for this clean revolution have been advances in technology and scale that have helped drive down costs. “The cost of installing panels whether on rooftops or utility-scale plants has fallen dramatically over the years,” points out Gaurav Upadhyay, Energy Finance Specialist at Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). However, going forward, even the government acknowledges that maintaining this pace of growth will require an amended playbook. “In the last decade, India’s renewable energy capacity has grown more than fivefold, from under 35 GW in 2014 to over 197 GW (excluding large hydro) today. The next leap requires not just more megawatts, but deeper system reforms,” the MNRE Ministry said in a press statement this month. The challenges related to the transmission network stem from essentially three sources — delayed execution, fragmented planning and the fluctuating nature of renewable power generation. First, let us look at the last element — the fluctuating nature of power generation from renewable sources. Designers of power transmission grids have always taken into account the need for a certain level of over capacity. This is because the demand for power varies significantly by the time of the day, and even season. For example, a grid catering primarily to a residential population may see peak demand in the evenings and summers, while an industrial area may see peak demand during day time. While historically, this cycle has primarily been demand led, the rise of renewables has led to the emergence of supply led fluctuations as renewables do not produce electricity at a uniform, or even predictable, pattern. Hence, on the days of high solar output, producers are often forced to curtail generation, leading to wasted energy and losses for developers. On the other hand, output can drop significantly on cloudy or rainy days, leading to underutilization of the grid and undersupply. Similar fluctuations are also seen on the grids connected to wind farms, with the variations connected to atmospheric conditions rather than insolation. According to Mercom Clean Energy Insights, since March 2025, nearly 4 GW of Wind-solar energy has been curtailed only in Rajasthan due to delays in transmission projects and lower power demand due to above-normal rainfall this year. It is therefore not surprising that India’s electricity grid infrastructure, designed decades ago for the steady supply generated by coal-based thermal power plants, is struggling to accommodate the variable and intermittent nature of renewable energy. A significant portion of renewable power often goes unused due to transmission bottlenecks and fluctuating demand, pointed out Upadhyay. “This oversupply has even driven daytime spot market prices into negative. India needs to ramp up its energy storage so excess solar power generated during the day can be stored and used later,” he added. Nikhil Nahar, Co-founder of SolarSquare, pointed out that operating a grid in today’s times has become far more complicated than it was in an era of predictable generation and demand, leading to the need for more sophisticated designs and advanced grid management tools. “This intermittency demands real-time balancing, flexible generation sources, and advanced forecasting tools—areas where India’s grid still lacks depth,” he noted. Compounding the challenge is the geographical mismatch between generation and demand. Much of India’s renewable energy is being generated in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, far from industrial demand centres such as Maharashtra, Delhi, and Karnataka. The mismatch between where power is produced and where it is consumed, which leads to evacuation difficulties, has become one of the most serious structural challenges in India’s energy transition. “Several auctioned renewable projects remain stranded as PPAs stall and transmission lags especially in Rajasthan and Gujarat, where 8-11 GW is stuck,” Upadhyay noted. The Infrastructure Gap: Transmission and Storage The second factor behind the grid’s inability to support the growth of renewable power is a lack of investment, giving rise to a widening infrastructure gap between the pace of renewable capacity additions and the development of supporting transmission and storage systems. Despite increased private sector participation under Tariff-Based Competitive Bidding, India’s overall transmission expansion has been slow and remains below National Electricity Policy targets. Annual transmission line additions have fallen short of planned levels since FY2019, with only FY2021 surpassing expectations. According to the recent Transmission expansion trails renewable energy growth in India report by IEEFA and JMK Research: “In FY2025, 8,830 circuit kilometres (ckm) of new transmission lines were commissioned against a target of 15,253 ckm, representing a 42% gap, with Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) additions at their lowest in a decade.” “The challenge begins right from the planning stage of a transmission project,” said Vishal Tripathi, Former Public Policy Expert at NITI Aayog. “These assets often have to pass through forest areas, defence land, agricultural zones and commercial properties, each requiring multiple clearances and permissions from different authorities.” However, transmission is only part of the puzzle. The intermittency of renewables means that to complete the transition, the grid must be connected with energy storage facilities. However, this is also an area which is at its infancy in India. The country’s current installed capacity of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is at just 205 MW whereas, according to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) estimates, the country will need 411.4 Gigawatt-hour (GWh) of energy storage systems by 2031-32. Of this, around – 236.2GWh, is expected to come from battery energy storage systems (BESS) and the remaining 175.2 GWh from pumped-hydro storage plants. Upadhyay of IEEFA points out that we cannot move away from our reliance on thermal plants until we get this part of the puzzle right. “We don’t yet have enough storage to shift daytime solar power to evening hours.” Policy and Institutional Bottlenecks The third element hampering the growth of transmission capacity in India is gaps in planning. The CEA, the central government agency in charge of transmission, has prepared a detailed National Electricity Plan (Transmission) to build up 500 GW of renewable energy transmission capacity by the year 2030 and 600 GW by 2032. According to the plan, over 1.91 lakh ckm of transmission lines and 1,270 GVA of transformation capacity is planned to be added during the ten year period from 2022-23 to 2031-32 (at 220 kV and above voltage level). In addition, the inter-regional transmission capacity is planned to increase to 143 GW by the year 2027 and further to 168 GW by the year 2032, from the present level of 119 GW. However, what the plan fails to address is the key question of who will invest in these inter-state transmission networks. If the responsibility falls largely on DISCOMs, that would create major problems, because most of them are already under severe financial stress. By 2023–24, their cumulative losses had reached nearly ₹6.9 lakh crore, while their outstanding debt stood at around ₹6.8 trillion. “Power distribution companies need sufficient funds to ensure smooth operations and capital investment. Without sufficient financial resources, the reliability of power system is compromised,” said Karn Pallav, Head –Regulatory Affairs, BSES Rajdhani Power. Today, the situation is such that even if India installs 500 GW of renewable capacity, it won’t be able to transmit all the power where it is needed. Bridging this gap will demand unprecedented coordination between the Centre and the states, faster clearances for transmission projects, and a massive push to develop storage infrastructure. Some of the initiatives that can help in addressing the gap include a single-window clearance system to streamline approvals for land acquisition, right-of-way and grid connectivity, performance-linked incentives and disincentives based on asset utilisation and asset monetisation and public-private partnerships. In addition, the country has to set up massive energy storage systems in renewable-rich regions such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu and co-locate solar and wind plants with such systems. India's clean energy transition now hinges less on generation and more on storage and transmission. Without swift action, we risk derailing the green transition of the world's fastest-growing economy.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "India’s economic expansion and accelerating digitalisation are creating a surge in electricity demand that is exposing deep vulnerabilities in the existing power grid. The South Asian nation has committed to 500 gigawatts of non-fossil capacity by 2030, but the grid cannot yet reliably deliver clean power when and where it is needed. Supply will have to grow faster, be firmer and be more flexible than the system has ever delivered. If India captures a larger share of global data center investment driven by AI, this challenge will arrive precisely when the grid is least equipped to handle it. Goldman Sachs estimates that power required from utilities now needs roughly 7.2% annual growth between fiscal years 2025 and 2035, up from a prior 5.6%. The ratio of power growth to economic growth has been revised to roughly 1.06, versus roughly 0.85 before. Rising appliance ownership, electric vehicle charging and green-hydrogen pilots are pushing demand higher across the economy. The compute infrastructure supporting the digital economy is migrating from traditional IT rooms to industrial-scale data centres, creating a new and concentrated source of load that operates on a different scale than anything the grid has handled before. Hyperscalers say power is the first or second question in every investment decision when they evaluate potential data center locations. India’s data-centre base is still in the low single-gigawatts today, but Bernstein forecasts cluster around 5 to 6 gigawatts by 2030, provided interconnects and land clear on time. Jefferies’ top-end view reaches roughly 8 gigawatts, which at typical costs of 4 to 5 million dollars per megawatt implies 32 to 40 billion dollars of capital expenditure by decade-end. AI servers draw five to seven times the power of a legacy server rack, according to HSBC, creating disproportionate pressure on the grid. At scale, a 1 gigawatt campus needs roughly 1.3 to 1.5 gigawatts of constant supply depending on how efficiently the facility uses power, per Morgan Stanley. Power availability and connection queues now drive site selection as much as land price does, fundamentally altering the economics of where these facilities can be built. Data centres use only a sliver of India’s power today, but their share plausibly rises into the low single digits by fiscal year 2030 even in Nomura’s base case scenario. In a more aggressive scenario, consumption reaches 80 terawatt-hours, creating demand that would rival entire industrial sectors. Silicon wants electrons on a firm schedule that the current grid cannot reliably provide. India can construct utility-scale solar farms in 12 to 24 months (Mohit Bhargava, Senior Advisor to India Energy and Climate Center at UC Berkeley and former CEO of NTPC Green Energy said at a recent conference), which makes the renewable buildout look deceptively simple on paper. Reconciling that speed with the physics of electricity demand is proving harder in practice. Solar panels flood the grid when daytime demand is comparatively low, then fade precisely as households and commercial loads climb after 5 PM. On Goldman’s full-year models, the system runs a 1% to 4% energy deficit by fiscal years 2034 through 2035. Five-minute modelling of the peak week under adverse weather produces a deficit nearer 9%. This is not a morality tale about dirty versus clean energy sources but a timing problem that no amount of solar capacity alone can solve, no matter how many panels are installed or how quickly they are brought online. Coal plants can run around the clock and can ramp up production during the evening hours to meet surging demand. Legacy flexibility in the existing fleet complicates this seemingly straightforward solution in ways that limit how much solar the grid can absorb. Many Indian units struggle to operate at levels much below 60% to 70% of capacity, according to data shared by federal grid operator POSOCO. Operating at these minimum levels is crucial to keep the grid’s frequency stable, yet this makes it harder to absorb midday solar or respond to clouds passing overhead. Flexibility retrofits and revised operating norms matter as much as new megawatts in addressing this constraint, but the scale of the upgrades required is substantial. Assessments suggest India may need roughly 140 gigawatts of additional coal capacity by fiscal year 2035 versus 2023 levels. The government’s current target is roughly 87 gigawatts by fiscal year 2032. Some of this coal is bridge capacity to stabilise a faster-greening grid, not a repudiation of renewables, but the scale required exceeds what policymakers have publicly acknowledged or what most analysts expected even two years ago. Transmission infrastructure is the rate-limiter on the entire system, constraining how quickly renewable capacity can be added even when the generation itself can be built rapidly. The National Electricity Plan allocates about $110 billion for transmission through 2032, expanding the network from roughly 485,000 to roughly 648,000 circuit-kilometres and adding nine long-haul high-voltage direct current links totalling roughly 33 gigawatts. Typical interstate lines take 30 to 36 months to complete, and that timeline arrives before accounting for right-of-way fights and land acquisition disputes that routinely add years to the process. India’s present ability to move power through the system at high voltages is nowhere near what a continent-scale renewables-plus-data-centre system needs to function efficiently. Moving bulk power efficiently across regions will demand more substations, more support for maintaining stable voltage and more high-voltage direct current backbones than are currently funded or planned. The investment exists on paper, but the physical infrastructure lags years behind where it needs to be to support the generation capacity that is either already built or under construction. The constraints are already affecting major renewable developers in concrete ways. Reliance has land banks suitable for well over 100 gigawatts of solar capacity, but the ability to connect to the grid is the choke point affecting actual deployment of these projects. Its first 690 megawatt application at Khavda, a village in Bhuj Taluka of Kutch district, was granted connection capacity only by 2030, three years later than requested and larger blocks open from 2032 onward. Data-centre developers cannot sit in a transmission queue for years waiting for grid connectivity to materialize. They will gravitate toward firm electrons and existing infrastructure, not promises of future capacity that may or may not arrive on schedule. Energy storage is attempting to fill the gap between when solar generates and when demand peaks, but the scale required is enormous. Peak-week modelling suggests India could require roughly 530 gigawatt-hours of energy storage by fiscal year 2032, with about 420 gigawatt-hours plausibly delivered by batteries on current pipelines versus roughly 240 gigawatt-hours in government guidance. Battery pack prices have fallen roughly a third over the last two years, making solar-plus-storage economically viable for shifting midday power to early evening hours and covering short peaks that were uneconomic before. At multi-hundred-gigawatt-hour scale, supply chains, financing and siting still constrain deployment speed in ways that make it difficult to build fast enough. Storage is a powerful complement to transmission and flexibility, not a replacement for either, and it cannot by itself solve the problem of evening demand. Natural gas looks like a textbook bridge fuel on paper, offering the flexibility and reliability that the system needs. Except that cost and availability work against it in practice in the Indian context. Even under prospective liquefied natural gas gluts on global markets, gas-fired generation sits higher on India’s merit order than coal because of fuel pricing dynamics that have persisted for years. Image and projection: Goldman Sachs Gas will find a role as peaking capacity and locational reliability, especially where transmission infrastructure and urban substations are running at their limits, but it will not underwrite the nation’s evening ramp at scale on current economics. The math simply does not work at the volumes required to make a meaningful difference in the overall power balance. Time-of-day tariffs, interruptible contracts for large users and automated demand response can shave the peak and reduce the need for new generation capacity if deployed aggressively. These tools should be pursued because they can deliver results faster than building new plants or transmission lines and at a fraction of the capital cost. The political economy resists change in ways that make widespread deployment difficult. Distribution company finances are fragile, tariff reform is jagged and politically contentious, and enforcing sharp evening prices on voters is rarely a career-enhancing move for state governments that depend on those votes. Without that price signal, smart loads remain a pilot program rather than a resource at scale that can materially affect the peak demand problem. Institutions will decide the pace as much as technology does, determining which solutions can be deployed and how quickly they can scale. The Central Electricity Authority and Central Electricity Regulatory Commission set operating norms that determine how low coal plants can be run, how quickly they must ramp and what flexibility investments can be recovered through tariffs. State distribution companies control connection timelines and local capital expenditure decisions that affect every project. They also ration pain through load-shedding rather than pay for upgrades that stress their balance sheets and require politically difficult tariff increases. Land acquisition and right-of-way rules for the interstate transmission system pit national priorities against local politics and immediate constituent concerns in ways that delay projects for years. Open-access permissions, banking rules, and cross-subsidy surcharges tilt corporate buyers toward captive generation solutions instead of grid-beneficial ones that would help the broader system but offer less certainty to individual companies. China’s solution to data-centre load has been a coal-plus-renewables tandem buttressed by ultra-high-voltage transmission lines that move power thousands of kilometres across the country. The country built firm capacity and a long-haul backbone first, then stacked wind and solar behind it once the grid could handle the variability. It is not clean by any measure, but it is stable and predictable in ways that enable industrial planning. Texas offers a cautionary mirror on the other end of the spectrum: a torrent of wind and solar capacity, relatively light interconnections between regions, and a price-only market that invites curtailment and volatility during extreme weather events. That system is now being partly tempered by a wave of battery installations, but the integration challenges remain significant. India cannot copy either model wholesale given its own institutional constraints and geography, but the lesson is the same everywhere. Get the transmission infrastructure and the operating rules right before promising 24-hour clean power to compute campuses that require uninterrupted supply. Most commentary fixates on long-distance transmission lines as the primary constraint limiting renewable deployment. The near-term crunch may actually be distribution infrastructure at the local level, which receives less attention but creates immediate bottlenecks. Data-centre parks and peaking plants need substations at various voltage levels, high-capacity feeders, and fault-level upgrades inside cities already operating at thermal and political limits. Who pays becomes key in determining what gets built and when: developers via hefty connection charges, or distribution companies via capital expenditure they can barely finance given their debt loads and tariff constraints. Connection queues and local reinforcement requirements may add as much delay as the interstate lines that dominate public discussion, creating a two-tier bottleneck that affects different projects in different ways. Avoiding a false binary choice is essential when considering how much coal versus everything else the system needs to manage the transition. A plausible fiscal year 2035 mix that manages the evening peak includes several components working together in ways that complement rather than substitute for each other. A large block of new coal capacity operating flexibly during the 6 PM to 11 PM hours when demand surges past what renewables can provide. An upgraded legacy fleet with lower minimum operating levels to absorb midday solar without destabilising the grid’s frequency or forcing curtailment. Hundreds of gigawatt-hours of batteries shaving intraday swings and covering the first hour of the peak before other sources take over. A modest wedge of gas for location-specific reliability and fast start capability where transmission constraints prevent coal from serving certain areas. A growing contribution from time-of-day tariffs and demand response as state politics allow and distribution companies become more financially stable. The exact shares will move with prices, weather patterns and policy choices as the decade progresses, but the direction is clear regardless of which specific path policymakers choose. India will add coal to buy time for transmission, storage and demand-side tools to catch up with the modern economy’s arrival, even as it continues building renewable capacity at record rates. The digital economy is arriving faster than the physical grid can adapt to handle its demands. Transmission lines take years to plan, approve, and construct under the best circumstances. Solar panels go dark at the worst moment for system reliability, creating precisely the gap that needs to be filled. Batteries are powerful tools but not yet cheap enough at the scale required to make evening peaks disappear entirely, despite the dramatic cost declines of recent years. Hydroelectric plants and nuclear reactors face long lead times and public resistance that delay their contribution to the grid mix, often by a decade or more from initial proposal to operation. Given these timelines, the dependence on high-carbon baseload power will rise before it falls, creating a period where emissions may increase even as renewable capacity expands. Policymakers cannot pretend otherwise or deny the contradiction between clean energy goals and near-term infrastructure realities. Discussion about this post",

    "full_text": "Synopsis Transmission problems are also hurting power trading, said Rajesh K Mediratta, director business development at Indian Energy Exchange. ET Bureau NEW DELHI: The power sector is unable to use at least 10% of its capacity due to the choked transmission network in the country, hurting projects of Tata Power, Essar Power, Jindal Power, JSW Energy, CLP, DB Power, MB Power, Emco Energy, GMR and Adhunik Power. Inadequate transmission has kept about 25,000 MW of generation capacity idle, making the problem comparable to the issue of acute fuel scarcity that has hit about 30,000 MW of new capacity, industry executives say. In addition to the inadequate capacity, regulatory authorities impose strict restrictions on the utilisation of existing networks and keep a large amount of transmission capacity idle as a safeguard against grid collapse. They say new transmission capacity in key corridors is scheduled to come up after four years, making the outlook grim for many plants. Transmission problems are also hurting power trading, said Rajesh K Mediratta, director business development at Indian Energy Exchange. “The impact of transmission congestion on the power exchanges has been increasing with each passing year impacting both the volumes as well as the prices. The volume lost is slated to increase further unless adequate measures are adopted to augment transmission capacity in the regions having congested transmission corridors.Constraints in the regional transmission system in south further added to the problem and increased the power deficit there,“ he said. Last month, no power could be imported into the southern region throughout the month either through the eastern or western corridor due to congestion, added Mediratta. Most power plants in western India have signed power purchase agreements with customers in the north or south because states in only these regions invited long-term PPAs. But there is no capacity in key power corridors to ship this power, making these plants idle. To compound matters for these plants, Coal India is not supplying coal to these plants because PPAs have not started operating. Ashok Khurana, director general of the Association of Power Producers, says restrictions on capacity utilisation of transmission corridors often prevent generation companies from supplying power even after signing long-term power supply agreements. He said there were many cases where power producers are unable to sell electricity in short-term markets due to congestions and restrictions. Transmission bottlenecks prevent the supply of power to deficit regions in summer and monsoon seasons, when demand peaks, he said.He also wrote to the regulator saying projects of Tata Power, Essar Power, Jindal Power, JSW Energy, CLP, DB Power, MB Power, Emco Energy, GMR and Adhunik Power are facing transmission constraints. At least half a dozen transmission projects of various companies including Pow ous companies including Pow er Grid Corporation, Re liance Infra and Sterlite Grid with investments of over . 7,000 crore are held up or de ` layed due to the slow speed of official clearances. Power companies say they are feel ing the pinch. “Power project developers f are already incurring losses due to cost overruns and in ability to utilise plant at full capacity is escalating the troubles. Sizeable power gen eration capacity is stranded because of lack of transmis sion network that prevents us from meeting the demands. Power transmission capacity has failed to grow in tandem with the growth of generation capacity,“ said an executive with a generation company. Lower generation due to weak transmission also prompts Coal India to cut fuel supply as the plant is not running at full capacity, the executive said. Industry sources said southern states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Telangana would not have been facing power shortages if there was adequate transmission capacity available with generating firms in MP, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. According to CERC, Indian Energy Exchange could not allow trade of close to 11 billion units of electricity in past three financial years due to congestion in transmission network. In fiscal 2012-13, almost 3.7 billion units were lost as a result of unavailability of as a result of unavailability of the corridors while in 2013-14 the number went up by 41% to 5.3 billion units.",

    "full_text": "FILE - A bus drives in downtown Madrid during a major power outage, Monday, April 28, 2025. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez, File) ENTSO-E’s factual report presents a second-by-second account of the ‘whats’ of the 28 April 2025 power system blackout of the Iberian Peninsula, however the ‘whys’ still remain unknown. This unprecedented event, the most severe blackout incident in the European power system in over 20 years, also affected a small area of France near the Spanish border for a limited duration and had major repercussions for citizens and society in Portugal and Spain. Drawing on data from the country’s TSOs, DSOs and other significant grid users including generators, ENTSO-E through its expert panel has now compiled the most comprehensive account of the event. Broadly attributed to a cascading series of generation disconnections along with voltage increases over a period of less than 90 seconds, the reasons for some of these are not known and detailed analysis is now under way for a final report, including recommendations to help prevent similar incidents in the future, in early 2026. When it started The starting point of the incident from the report’s point of view is 12:32:00 (CEST) on 28 April, at which time the voltage of Iberian power system at the 400kV level was below 420kV and no notable oscillation with amplitude higher than 20mHz could have been observed. From that time onwards, several important generation trips occurred. Between 12:32:00.000 and 12:32:57.000, there was a loss of 208MW identified distributed wind and solar generators in northern and southern Spain, as well as an increase in net load in the distribution grids of approximately 317MW, either due to the disconnection of small embedded generators &lt;1 MW (mainly rooftop PV) or to an actual increase in load or to a combination of both. The reasons for these events are not known. The Northeast faces distinct challenges, including transportation electrification, aging infrastructure, renewable integration, grid modernization, and increasingly severe weather. DTECH® Northeast will assemble leading stakeholders to tackle these issues head-on, offering insights into cutting-edge technologies and strategies that ensure reliability, sustainability, and customer satisfaction. Join us in Boston, Massachusetts, from November 17-19, 2025! The next phase of major disconnection events started some milliseconds after 12:32:57 with the tripping of a generation transformer in the region of Granada due to the activation of an over-voltage protection in the 220kV side of a 400/220kV transformer connecting several renewable generation facilities to the transmission grid. This was followed by two sets of trips at 12:33:16.460 and 12:33:16.820, the reasons for which are not known, resulting in an additional loss of around 725MW of PV and thermo-solar facilities connected to two 400 kV transmission substations in the area of Badajoz. After that, several trips between 12:33:17 and 12:33:18.020 occurred that led to disconnection of wind and solar generation in Segovia, Huelva, Badajoz, Sevilla and Caceres for a total of approximately 930MW – some due to over-voltage protection, but most not known. As some generation units were consuming reactive power with the effect of reducing the voltage, the disconnections of these units without adequate compensation of loss of reactive power by other resources in the system with the capability to inject/absorb reactive power meant that voltages in the system increased, not only in Spain but also in Portugal. Furthermore, the frequency decreased. Up until then, no generation trips had been observed in Portugal or France. However, between 12:33:18 and 12:33:21, the voltage of the south area of Spain sharply increased, and consequently also in Portugal, triggering a cascade of generation losses that caused the frequency of the Spanish and Portuguese power system to decline. At 12:33:19, the power systems of Spain and Portugal started losing synchronism with the rest of the European system and despite the activation of the automatic load shedding and system defence plans at 12:33:23.960, the electrical separation of the Iberian system was completed with the tripping of the AC interconnections to Morocco and France. ENTSO-E’s 45-person panel that prepared the report was led by Klaus Kaschnitz of APG in Austria and Richard Balog from MAVIR in Hungary, experts from TSOs not directly affected by the incident. Also included were panelists from both affected and non-affected TSOs, including Red Electrica from Spain, Portugal’s REN and RTE from France.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran.

Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://frontline.thehindu.com?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ## Stories that help you connect the dots ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

Translate potential to sustained performance](https://prod-cm.worley.com/prod-cm.worley.com#four) **Daniel Law, Senior Group Director, Strategy, and Jamie Garden, Vice President, Sales, share insights on India’s pivotal energy transition and the strategic bets that will determine long-term success.** India is at a defining moment. By 2047, India will mark 100 years of independence with an ambition to transform into a developed economy or ‘Viksit Bharat’. Central to that ambition lies a massive energy transition: rewiring a coal‑reliant economy into one powered by green hydrogen, renewables, and electrified mobility. This shift is anything but linear. To explore what’s ahead, we collaborated with the [Fletcher School at Tufts University](https://fletcher.tufts.edu/) to model three possible scenarios that could shape the arc of India’s future: - **Aspirational India**(8–9% annual GDP growth): India goes all-in. Aggressive institutional reforms, high capital investment, and coherent policy coherence push India into a golden era of growth. India achieves 85%+ renewable energy in its power mix and becomes a global clean-tech hub. - **Momentum India**(6–7% growth): Steady progress with structural constraints. The green ambition advances – but coal remains king in many states. Renewables scale, but grid limitations and policy patchwork slow integration. Hydrogen and CCUS inch forward, but cost parity remains elusive. - **Constrained India**(4–5% growth): Growth is hindered by fragmented governance, infrastructure bottlenecks, and delayed reform. Coal dominance persists, and green capital is cautious, reducing the effectiveness of energy transition efforts. Missed opportunities in workforce development or industrial policy could delay India’s demographic gains. These aren’t theoretical – they demand real choices now. The strategic bets global firms make today – on infrastructure, partnerships, and local execution – will determine whether they ride India’s growth wave or miss it. How these scenarios play out will be further influenced by how organizations navigate market forces and identify and overcome challenges. In the following sections, we explore how CEOs can meet these challenges – not just to survive India’s complexity, but to turn it into a durable competitive advantage. ## Four challenges for the India Decade and how to transform them into a competitive advantage ### 1.Managing a ‘multi-India’ reality For many global CEOs, India’s headline numbers are enticing: 7%+ growth, rising middle-class consumption, and bold green energy ambitions. But behind the macro story lies a sobering operational reality – India isn’t one big market, it’s 28 different ones. For global firms used to national uniformity, India’s federal complexity often defies standard market approaches. Each state operates with its own regulatory lens, economic maturity, infrastructure readiness, and political dynamics. The differences are striking. Maharashtra tops GDP charts and is a magnet for private capital; Tamil Nadu is fast emerging as an EV manufacturing powerhouse. Meanwhile, states like Bihar remain largely agrarian, with limited industrial infrastructure or energy grid modernization. In fact, just six high-growth states account for nearly half of India’s GDP but attract more than 75% of private infrastructure investment. Even in energy transition, regional disparities shape the pace and model of progress – India added 113 GW of new generating capacity in 2024, mostly renewables, but that growth was highly concentrated in a few progressive states. A national strategy that ignores this nuance is, at best, an oversimplification – and at worst, a recipe for missteps. National initiatives could stall in lagging states. Capital could get locked in mismatched regulatory environments. Partnerships can falter when local dynamics are misunderstood. _**Solution: Shift from an ‘India strategy’ to a ‘portfolio of India’s strategy’.**_ Think of India less as a country and more as a continent, where relevance and scale are earned one region at a time. With that mindset, CEOs should build state-level playbooks. Prioritize no-regret states for green energy deployment. Embed local regulatory affairs teams that understand subnational nuances. Structure partnerships to be modular, not monolithic. At Worley, we turned this ‘multi-India’ challenge into a catalyst for opportunity and expansion that has allowed us to tap into a diverse talent pool across major urban centers, develop local expertise hubs and remain close to the headquarters and operational units of our customers. We do this through a decentralized network of offices across eight strategic locations in India. For example, our offices in Mumbai and Bangalore are strategically located close to the headquarters of major customers such as Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla Group, and multinational corporations like Shell. Our Vadodara (Baroda) office is ideally situated to support India’s chemicals hub, while our Kolkata office serves as a center of expertise for the metals and mining sector, for both domestic and international customers. ### 2\\. Timing green investments amid a coal-constrained base India is advancing toward an ambitious green future – 90% clean energy by 2047, full EV adoption, and scaled green hydrogen. But the road there is anything but linear. While India has made significant progress by scaling its solar and wind infrastructure in the last decade, coal still remains the backbone of India’s power sector – over 70% of electricity generation and a critical source of industrial employment. In 2024, coal-fired generation hit a record high of 1,221 terawatt hours, with another 80+ GW of new coal capacity planned by 2032. The opportunity in renewables, hydrogen, battery storage, and biofuels is real but fragmented, with rollout timelines varying dramatically across sectors and states. The challenge isn’t just picking sectors and technologies. The fundamental dilemma is when to invest. Jump in too early, and capital risks being stranded amid policy reversals or affordability constraints. Wait too long, and lose out on early-mover advantages to fast-moving competitors. In a landscape this uneven, timing is everything. **_Solution: Think in layers, not leaps._** A winning strategy in India doesn’t require binary decisions between fossil and green – it requires balancing long-term bets with transitional hedges. Fundamentally, it’s about sequencing bets in step with local policy signals, state‑level readiness, cost curves and the social realities of India’s energy landscape, to build optionality. Companies should initially invest in hybrid models like solar + green hydrogen, clean coal technologies, or dual-fuel systems near industrial hubs. These offer flexibility while preparing for policy and market inflections. At the same time, CEOs should aim to co-locate and co-create projects to ensure success. For example, anchor projects near steel, cement, or chemical clusters where industrial off-takers are actively decarbonizing. It will also be important to phase projects and investments alongside state-specific reforms – such as open access policies, renewable purchase obligations, or utility decarbonization targets. At Worley, we have adopted a balanced approach to the evolving energy landscape globally. Our strategy is to have a balanced portfolio that seeks to play in, and bridge, both traditional and sustainable segments. Our early work in traditional sectors has since evolved into a strategic partnership helping drive customers’ sustainability agenda. When customers have announced their net-zero ambitions, we are their trusted engineering partner. ### 3\\. Collaborating with India’s ‘Three Titans’: PSUs, family‑owned conglomerates, and agile privateers India is not just a growth market, but a strategic arena shaped by established power structures. For multinational corporations (MNCs), the real challenge isn’t just solution-market fit – it’s system-market fit. India’s industrial landscape is anchored by three powerful forces: 1) large Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) with policy influence; 2) powerful family-owned conglomerates like Reliance and Tata with legacy networks, land access and synergistic edge across the value chain; and 3) fast-moving, tech-savvy first generation entrepreneurs or private players backed by domestic and foreign capital. These Titans are market-makers and they help set price expectations, steer regulatory outcomes, and command the supply chains that MNCs often struggle to penetrate. The scale of these Titans is formidable. India’s top 10 conglomerates account for over 20% of GDP. The combined value of India’s top three family-run businesses is on par with Singapore’s GDP. For global players, aligning with these engines of growth is often more productive than competing head-on. **_Solution: Complement global expertise with local strategic partnerships._** Winning in India doesn’t mean outspending incumbents – it means embedding yourself where they need global capability. Whether it’s advanced tech or IP, digital infrastructure, or a global footprint of experts, MNCs can offer what local giants don’t have in-house. Structured right, partnerships can offer mutual de-risking: local players bring distribution, land, and on-ground intelligence; MNCs bring IP, compliance rigor, and global networks. CEOs may consider smart moves involving strategic minority stakes, co‑investments, or joint ventures in domestic green energy, digital platforms, or AI‑enabled supply chains. These investments can be value accretive, especially as next-gen leaders of Indian family businesses seek to globalize, credible international partners are increasingly welcome. Worley’s strategy in India is anchored on complementing our global expertise with local strategic capabilities. We believe that our core value proposition to customers is our global expertise and footprint. Our strong network of SMEs and global project experience spanning 44 countries have been instrumental in shaping this, especially in nascent sectors such as low carbon hydrogen and battery materials. This has allowed us to bring a unique value proposition to India’s powerhouses and to diversify our customer base across a balanced mix of the three Titans. ### 4\\. Translate potential to sustained performance For global companies, India’s promise is undeniable – its scale, demographic edge, and accelerating energy transition make it a critical growth market. But translating potential into performance is another matter entirely. India’s regulatory environment reflects its democratic and federal complexity, requiring navigation, not shortcuts. For multinationals conditioned by institutional predictability, this can stall execution before it even begins. In the renewable energy sector, for example, a single project can require upwards of 50 approvals spanning central and state agencies. Timelines can vary by 300% across states. Yet, despite these challenges, India drew $13.7 billion in clean energy investments in 2022 — proof that the upside is real for those who can navigate the system. Add in the complexity of workforce dynamics. India is home to the world’s largest working-age population, but only a fraction is in formal employment, and female labor force participation is one of the lowest globally at just 20%. Over-reliance on expats or transactional partnerships often limits adaptability and erodes long-term capability. The result: a paradox of abundant labor but constrained access to skilled, employable talent – especially outside urban centers. **_Solution: Build an exceptional, localized talent pool for execution._** To ensure sustained performance, CEOs need to build an ‘India-first’ leadership pipeline with deep sectoral and functional experience in the country, not just cross-market generalists. Additionally, local leadership must be empowered with full P&L ownership, moving from HQ‑centric decision-making to locally embedded hubs with real authority to adapt, negotiate, and deliver. CEOs must also invest in attracting top-tier talent and upskilling them through focused initiatives – upskilling and gender inclusion aren’t CSR, they’re foundational infrastructure for growth. Partnering with academia and government will build education-to-employment bridges, especially in Tier 2 and 3 cities where future demand and talent will rise. At Worley, our local leadership team are all Indian nationals by intention. While we tap into our global network for SMEs, our operational, sales and functional leaders in India are also locals with a rich industry experience. Attracting and retaining exceptional talent is key to ensuring long-term success. We actively collaborate with universities across India – not just urban centers – to identify the best talent. For example, in 2024, Worley India partnered with 66 universities as part of our graduate recruitment program, with 60% of graduates being women. We foster a culture that promotes continuous learning both on-the-job and through structured classroom training programs. Over 200 leaders in India have participated in Worley’s flagship leadership development program – STEP. The message is clear: succeeding in India requires more than presence – it demands strong local capability, agility in operations, and a willingness to treat execution capability as the new competitive edge. ## Worley in India: Built for Complexity, Ready for the Future At Worley, India isn’t a satellite – it’s a core engine of our global capability. With almost 7,000 professionals across eight regional hubs, we’ve been embedded in the Indian landscape for more than four decades. We’re not just watching India’s energy transition – we’re building it. From engineering solar manufacturing facilities in Gujarat to supporting offshore platforms in Qatar from Hyderabad, our India operations power both local delivery and global excellence through our Global Integrated Delivery (GID) model. Our teams in India are delivering projects in green hydrogen, low-carbon fuels, grid modernization, circular economy solutions, and battery storage globally, while helping customers navigate complex local regulations and state-specific opportunities. ### Discover more [Solution · **Worley Consulting**](https://prod-cm.worley.com/en/solutions/worley-consulting) [Solution · **Low carbon fuels**](https://prod-cm.worley.com/en/solutions/industries/chemicals-and-fuels/fuels/low-carbon-fuels) [Solution · **Low carbon hydrogen**](https://prod-cm.worley.com/en/solutions/industries/low-carbon-energy/hydrogen/low-carbon-hydrogen) [Battery materials\\ \\ Thought leadership · 6 mins read **Leading with innovation, not replication: India’s battery industry is at a crossroads**](https://prod-cm.worley.com/en/insights/our-thinking/resources/leading-with-innovation-not-replication-india-battery-industry-at-a-crossroads) ### Get in touch First name\\* Last name\\* Work email\\* What’s the reason for your inquiry?Select one optionCustomer or partner inquiriesSupplier or vendor inquiriesBilling and finance questionsInvestor relationsMedia relationsCareer opportunitiesCurrent or previous employee supportFeedback or concernsOther Your company Your job roleSelect which is your current roleC-levelPresident/Vice President/Senior vice presidentDirectorManagerSenior associateLeadExecutiveSenior ConsultantProject managerConsultantEngineerScientistAnalystCoordinatorAdministratorGraduateTrainee The industry relating to your inquirySelect the main market sector for your inquiryConventional EnergyLow Carbon EnergyChemicals & FuelsResources (Mining, minerals and metals)Technology Your locationWhich region / country are you based in?AfghanistanAland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCabo VerdeCambodiaCameroonCanadaCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongo, Republic of (Brazzaville)Congo, the Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCote d'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuracaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands (Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City State)HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIran, Islamic Republic ofIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Democratic People's Republic ofKorea Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People's Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestine, State ofPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarReunionRomaniaRussian FederationRwandaSaint BarthelemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyrian Arab RepublicTaiwanTajikistanTanzania United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic ofVietnamVirgin Islands BritishVirgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe Your comment By checking this box you confirm that you have read and agree to our [Privacy Policy](https://prod-cm.worley.com/en/site-services/privacy).",

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

    "full_text": "Results from India's general election indicate that the ruling party will return to office but will need to work with coalition partners, which will likely still result in broad domestic economic policy continuity, but will probably also introduce intra-coalition splits on major reforms and controversial social measures that generate some policymaking slowdowns and potential uncertainty. As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

(NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

    "full_text": "Bangladesh will likely adopt a more assertive foreign policy, which will likely include strengthening ties with Pakistan while balancing its economic dependencies on India and maintaining cooperation on security and regional stability. On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen from politically sensitive targets, and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents from the Offices of the Dalai Lama, and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing sensitive information on citizens of numerous third party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business information, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while operating core servers located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and motivation of the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some of the associations of the attackers through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an eight month, collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and SecDev) and the Shadowserver Foundation. The investigation employed a fusion methodology, combining technical interrogation techniques, data analysis, and field research, to track and uncover the Shadow cyber espionage network.

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up...",

On August 27th, the US raised the tariff on most Indian exports from 25% to 50%. According to US president Donald Trump, the additional punitive measure has been taken because of India’s imports of Russian oil (of which India is the second-largest buyer) and defence equipment at a time when Russia has frustrated Mr Trump’s attempts to end the war in Ukraine. ## Why does it matter? EIU believes that India will resist giving up inexpensive oil imports from Russia, given the need to ensure energy security without fuelling crises in inflation, the balance of payments and government subsidies. India is a major energy importer, with 80% of its crude oil needs being met by imports. Since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has supplanted other major sources of oil imports for India, such as Iraq and the US, because of price considerations. Substantial investment has also gone into upgrading Indian refineries to refine Ural-grade crude oil from Russia, which formed less than 1% of the Indian crude oil import basket prior to 2022. The punitive nature of the additional tariff suggests that it is a negotiating tactic from the US to influence the terms of ongoing bilateral trade talks with India. This is also evident in the fact that the US has not yet imposed a similar punitive measure on China, which is the largest importer of discounted Russian crude oil. Notwithstanding this pressure, energy security needs will trump other considerations for India, which will continue to favour Russian crude oil supplies, while also promising to step up energy imports from the US. There is now a risk of increased belligerence in trade talks between India and the US, which would complicate the achievement of a mutually favourable trade deal. The Indian administration has taken a hardline stance on the US government’s tariff rhetoric, in a stark contrast to the attitude struck by South-east Asian nations. India will continue to firmly oppose US access in politically sensitive areas such as agriculture (including genetically modified crops) and dairy products. Nonetheless, given the lack of will for a complete decoupling on both sides, we still believe that a bilateral trade agreement of some form will manifest in the months ahead, with complicated issues left for future discussions. If the 50% tariff on India remains in place for the rest of fiscal year 2025/26 (April-March), we believe that it will reduce GDP growth to 5.8%, from our current forecast of 6.2% (under the baseline 25% tariff rate). The higher tariffs are expected to affect over half of India’s exports destined for the US, including textiles, gems and jewellery, marine products, machinery and leather. These sectors will face lower export orders, slower hiring, limited capacity addition, lower foreign investment and poor stock index performance. Three factors will preclude a sharper slowdown in Indian growth: exemptions for certain categories (including steel, aluminium, pharmaceuticals, energy and electronics); the relatively low share of exports in India’s economy (goods exports to the US are equivalent to about 2% of India’s GDP); and recent trade diversification efforts by India. ## What next? We believe that the US will lower tariffs on Indian exports eventually, though the timeline remains highly uncertain. In the event that a trade deal is abandoned altogether, or if the US ratchets up its tariff narrative against India, the impact on GDP growth will be larger through second-round effects such as imported inflation (resulting from currency contagion), weaker corporate confidence and financial market slumps, although this will be reflected from 2026/27. This would also involve a major upheaval in India-US ties, though it is not our core forecast. ## Want to understand how regional variation shapes India’s business environment?
