These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. India’s long-running class-based, economic insurgency—the Naxalite insurgency (or Community Party of India [CPI]-Maoist insurgency)—is a case study in which external secu\u0002rity partnerships will remain limited, if not mostly unwelcomed, in New Delhi. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of do\u0002mestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Washington would be ill-served by an In\u0002dian backlash to such unwelcomed assertiveness. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime secu\u0002rity activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counter\u0002terrorism intelligence-sharing and operations. The United States instead should focus on not only its offers of major near-term bilateral military assistance for security cooperation but also, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns in New Delhi and Washington. 2 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Introduction This paper frames the contours of the recent and ongoing expansion in U.S.-India security ties. Then it briefly sketches the trajectory of the Naxalite insurgency through its first two phases and then focuses on the factors that made its third phase—from 2004 to the present—such a serious security challenge. The paper highlights the unique domestic factors that allowed the Naxalite rebellion’s rise to the status of India’s most significant internal security challenge from 2007 to 2010. It also identifies those domestic factors that enabled effective counterinsurgency actions beginning in 2011 and effective containment of the threat by 2014. After indicating the kinds of bilateral security assistance offered by the United States to India in recent years, the paper indicates the limited appeal of outside assistance to India in the domestic counterinsur\u0002gency arena and assesses why India’s self-selected counterinsurgency partnership limitations remain firmly in place. It concludes with some lessons learned for U.S. policymakers in terms of the opportunities and limitations for working with India in matters of domestic insurgency, advising that these limitations make sense on many levels. It also asserts that India’s limitations should be respected in Washington and Honolulu to avoid backlash from New Delhi. Any such backlash might threaten far more important U.S.-India bilateral interests in which shared mari\u0002time and other strategic interests seem to increasingly diverge with those of China and in areas of mutual benefit from global counterterrorism cooperation. The analysis in this paper is based on 3 years of author research into the unique features of the Naxalite insurgency in India. The research includes field interviews conducted on three visits to India during 2014 and 2015, one of which featured time in Kolkata and West Bengal. Expanding U.S.-India Security Framework, with Limits Growing for more than a decade, bilateral defense and security cooperation between the United States and India began accelerating quickly in 2014 and continued into 2016. Much of this acceleration, although not all of it, owed to the tone and tenor of the Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, elected and seated in 2014. Modi’s government, which is Indian nationalist with a dynamic economic, diplomatic, and security agenda, followed a decade-long Indian National Congress (INC) government that had become sclerotic in its dealings with the United States and other global partners from 2009 to 2013. The INC government set the table for U.S.-India defense and security cooperation during the mid-2000s, demonstrating a broad\u0002based Indian commitment to improved bilateral relations with the United States after decades 3 India’s Naxalite Insurgency of limited transactions. But the nationalist government of Prime Minister Modi has been driv\u0002ing it forward vigorously. The ongoing acceleration in broad Indo-American relations has taken many forms, in\u0002cluding high diplomacy. Prime Minister Modi made visiting the United States a priority, travel\u0002ing to America within 4 months of his May 2014 accession to the position of prime minister. Modi then made President Barack Obama the first ever U.S. President bestowed the high honor as chief guest at India’s Republic Day Parade in January 2015. During this visit, Obama and Modi signed a historic Joint U.S.-India Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region.1 Modi made a third informal visit to the United States in September 2015, using this historically rapid return to enhance economic relations between the national private and public sectors.2 The United States has committed to a wide array of economic projects in India fea\u0002turing public-private innovation, deeper financial cooperation and inclusive digital networks, “smart city” development in selected Indian cities, and support for increasing economic con\u0002nectivity between India and the states of South and Southeast Asia.3 The acceleration of broad bilateral ties has been showcased by the steady increase in de\u0002fense and security cooperation between the two countries. In June 2016, on a historic fourth visit to the United States and in conjunction with a third bilateral summit,4 Prime Minister Modi made a joint statement with President Obama declaring India and the United States to be “major defense partners,” expressing aspirations for expanded exchange of dual-use technolo\u0002gies and maritime security cooperation.5 The outcomes from this mid-2016 leadership engage\u0002ment underscored the fact that there have been noteworthy enhancements in military technol\u0002ogy interaction processes, basic military logistics and administrative arrangements, and joint military exercises. Since 2014, Prime Minister Modi has accelerated the process of bilateral security collabo\u0002ration on military modernization with emphasis on greater foreign investment in the Indian defense sector than ever before. Modi’s government covets American participation in India’s defense industry build-out to a degree not seen in the previous Indian government. The United States has worked to expand its 2012 bilateral defense initiative with India known as the U.S.- India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI). Pursuant to President Obama’s January 2015 visit for Republic Day, the United States has focused DTTI in pursuit of six major defense technology co-development and co-production efforts. There has been a particular focus on deeper cooperation in the areas of maritime security and maritime domain awareness.6 The United States and India also have done serious work on establishing basic frame\u0002work defense agreements that would enable closer cooperation and collaboration between their 4 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 militaries. Throughout 2015 and early 2016, both governments worked hard to develop mutu\u0002ally acceptable text for three critical military-to-military agreements. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), Basic Exchange and Coopera\u0002tion Agreement (BECA), and—perhaps the most consequential of the three—Logistics Supply Agreement.7 Aimed to move beyond the limited U.S.-India 2002 General Security of Military Information Agreement that underpinned modest U.S.-India defense interactions for more than a decade, the bilateral effort on these documents demonstrated important forward prog\u0002ress. Yet this progress did not beget culmination in formal agreements. Many observers hoped that these arrangements would be ready for signature during Secretary of Defense Ash Carter’s April 2016 visit to New Delhi for discussions with Minister of Defense Manohar Parrikar. But Indian sensitivities and complications in language and trust limited the April joint announce\u0002ment to one confirming that the defense leaders were agreed in principal—but had not yet signed—a modified Logistics Supply Agreement, known as a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement.8 It also signaled that both parties must continue to work on “other” agreements to enhance military cooperation and technology transfer. The CISMOA and BECA were not formally mentioned in the final statement of the meeting.9 In the area of joint military exercises, the U.S.-India partnership has been expanding. In 2015, India conducted more joint military exercises with the U.S. military than any other in the world.10 India and United States agreed in 2015 to extend a permanent invitation for Japanese naval forces to participate annually in Exercise Malabar. The United States, India, and Japan held Malabar 2016 in early June in the northern waters of the Philippine Sea, an area close to the East and South China seas, signaling to Beijing that the three nations hold a common interest in freedom of high seas navigation in all areas of the Pacific Ocean.11 But the acceleration and expansion of bilateral security interactions come with Indian limitations—ones that must temper U.S. policymaker aims, ambitions, and expectations. While agreeing to participate in the 2016 Malabar exercise with Japan and the United States in the northern Philippines, India firmly declined an offer by the commander of U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, to sign on for joint naval patrols with the United States, Japan, and Aus\u0002tralia in the South Pacific.12 India also has remained wary of any firm commitment to a bilateral defense CISMOA or BECA. Despite more than 2 years of bilateral effort, there remains no real progress on the joint development of jet engines or aircraft carrier technologies—both of which are target technologies for joint development.13 Each of these factors and more demonstrate that crafting a bilateral defense partnership between the United States and India will be a slow process 5 India’s Naxalite Insurgency that requires better understanding of differing critical equities. This process requires sustained, patient leadership in both countries in the face of certain frustrations moving forward. Scoping Bilateral Security Collaboration Limits: Indian Domestic Counterinsurgency and Counterterrorism The U.S. and Indian militaries have their own detailed and unique experiences in counter\u0002insurgency operations, so counterinsurgency seems a logical focal point for greater U.S.-India defense collaboration and partnership, and in many ways it is. But in other ways, it is not. U.S. policymakers and security analysts should understand the differences. When it comes to outside assistance and security partnership collaboration with India in its ongoing experiences with domestic insurgency, U.S. policymakers and military leaders must remain aware that India does not—and likely will not—treat U.S. military offers of direct assis\u0002tance with a warm welcome. India’s experiences with its long-running domestic Naxalite insur\u0002gency provide a powerful example about the limited scope for U.S. military engagement and the circumspect manner in which any U.S. security assistance must be approached with New Delhi. The lessons about context, tenor, and tone found in the example of the Naxalite insurgency over the past 10 years demonstrate that the United States is a better partner for India when remaining at distance, as New Delhi deals with its unique domestic insurgency challenges. India’s Approach to Domestic Insurgency Over the past 60 years, India has confronted three major domestic insurgencies.14 In Jam\u0002mu and Kashmir, disaffected Muslim groups and unsatisfied local populations have contested India’s so-called occupation of its territories on the southeastern side of the Line of Control. India’s northeast has undergone multiple, overlapping waves of tribal, socioethnic-based insur\u0002gent movements since the mid-1950s. These northeastern separatist insurgencies have ebbed and flowed as Indian military and political approaches to their grievances eliminated some and catalyzed others. India also has been confronted with economic class–based violence and armed confrontation in its eastern regions, violence referred to as a Naxalite or Maoist insurgency. Numerous Indian analysts, and some outsiders, argue that India has among the best re\u0002cords in the world when combating insurgencies.15 The claim is debatable on many levels. Yet it does accurately reflect that India has persistent experience with a variety of domestic insurgencies over a considerable period of time. Official Indian counterinsurgency doctrine formally espouses a population-centric strategy focused on winning “hearts and minds.”16 A more detailed examination of India’s record reveals that India often does take a political 6 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 approach in combination with a military one when facing domestic insurgencies. However, India’s political approaches often are less about hearts and minds and more often feature ex\u0002tended periods of national-level tolerance of state- and local-level politician and police leader\u0002ship manipulation of insurgent groups. Often this manipulation is in the pursuit of regional and local vote banks (or vote blocks). Frequently manipulation is followed by the co-option of rebellion elites in an effort to buy-out, or limit the insurgency once it festers to a level beyond the ability of the state and regional authorities to manage. Co-option approaches have taken the forms of turning insurgents through monetary compensation, creating new political space for a “turned” insurgent group, or abducting and torturing key insurgent leaders.17 Quite often these nonkinetic approaches have created their own problems with corrupt security forces, increased criminal activity, and a litany of human rights complaints and investigations.18 India’s employment of military forces in domestic counterinsurgency operations has fea\u0002tured a number of innovative practices, some successful and others counterproductive. When engaged fully, the Indian national response tends to feature a combination of state police forces, Central Armed Police Forces, special paramilitary units, and—in some cases such as Kashmir and India’s Northeast—the introduction of regular army units. India’s federal statutes mandate that the chief minister (or governor) of a state formally request national police (including Cen\u0002tral Armed Police Forces units), paramilitary, or national army support before such forces can be introduced into a counterinsurgency fight. In those cases when the army is introduced, it must be authorized by the prime minister and given authorities by the Indian parliament to operate under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which includes the authority for military forces to make arrests, search without warrants, and shoot to kill civilians when required.19 In\u0002dia’s martial counterinsurgency activities are normally “enemy centric” and have been assessed to regularly feature a strategy of attrition and raw coercion where overwhelming numbers of security forces attempt to suffocate the insurgency at the same time that political activities are conducted to co-opt its leadership.20 There are several important conclusions to be drawn about India’s historical approach to domestic counterinsurgency. First, India does pursue varied counterinsurgency approaches to its multiple domestic insurgencies, depending on the unique context of each. Some respons\u0002es—such as those in Jammu and Kashmir and Northeast India—have featured a permanent deployment of the Indian army. Other responses, such as those toward the respective phases of the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India, have been limited to national central armed police forces (mainly but not exclusively Central Reserve Police Forces [CRPF]) deployment into the unsettled states from the central government (see appendix B for detail on national special 7 India’s Naxalite Insurgency police units). Second, India’s political and military approaches toward domestic insurgency generally do not follow a classic hearts and minds approach. Instead, they normally feature enemy-centric and highly kinetic military operations combined with creative, and often con\u0002troversial, political co-option of selected insurgent groups and group leaders. Third, India’s federal democratic structure often drives domestic counterinsurgency responses that feature uncomfortable political tradeoffs at the local level, state level, and between the state and the national governments. The political mobilization aspect of domestic insurgent groups creates incentives for political parties to harness these groups for their own ends.21 Invariably, this political utility makes them hard to counter in a timely manner and then difficult to address in the face of growing corruption, illegal activities, and often human rights questions as they embed into the political and social space. In general, Indian domestic counterinsurgency has worked for the country out and its distinctive system of governance and its complex national ethnic makeup. India’s approaches have contained, but not eliminated, the three major insurgencies that it has faced since inde\u0002pendence. But for many Westerners, India’s domestic counterinsurgency “successes” can look exceptionally violent and uncomfortably incomplete.22 This divergence in perspectives is im\u0002portant. It indicates why India prefers strict autonomy in the conduct of its domestic counterin\u0002surgent operations, routinely brushing aside the limited offers of direct outside military support that it receives. It also demonstrates why outside partners, including the United States, should realize that if they push too aggressively in offering well-intentioned direct assistance in these areas, they could encounter significant resistance in New Delhi—possible to the point where security cooperation could be dampened in other more important areas of mutual interest. India’s deep past and recent experiences with the Naxalite insurgency demonstrate the wisdom of these conclusions. The Naxalite Insurgency—History and Context: Phases 1 and 2 The Naxalite insurgency started as a communist peasant revolt in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It later evolved into a combination of ethnic-, caste-, and class-based political violence across a number of the poorest provinces in India’s east.23 It became known as Naxalism, or the Naxalite movement, given its late 1950s origins as a Maoist movement struggling for in\u0002dependence in the small village of Naxalbari in the state of West Bengal, along the Indo-Nepal border (see map 1).24 The 1967 Naxalbari uprising against feudal landlords sowed the seeds for insurgency in India.25 8 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 The Naxalites were a group of far-left radical communists who promoted Maoist political sentiment and ideology to fight exploitation by landlords in India’s feudal postcolonial socio\u0002economic system. In this approach, the Naxalites broke from the tradition of Indian communist Map 1. States and Union Territories of India 9 India’s Naxalite Insurgency political participation in the electoral system supplemented by general worker strikes that had been the staple of Communist Party of India activity from the 1920s through the 1950s.26 Dur\u0002ing the 1940s and 1950s, the CPI had become aligned with Moscow in its international leanings, functioning in India mainly as a political party. Around the same time, communism in India split in a third direction, with the CPI-Marxist group taking a more radical approach to its po\u0002litical rhetoric but mainly pursuing its own independent parliamentary path.27 Naxalism is based upon an extremist belief that the Indian government is a semicolonial, feudalistic, and imperial entity that needs to be overthrown. Naxalism’s objective is to seize state power through a protracted armed struggle against big landlords and petty government of\u0002ficials. Naxalism takes up the cause of the marginalized sections of society. It often opposes the implementation of various developmental projects such as construction of roads, rails, schools, and hospitals in affected areas in order to demonstrate to the people the ineffectiveness of the state. When successful, the Naxalite movement has operated in a vacuum created by the absence or collapse of the administrative structure at the local, provincial, or state level.28 The Naxalite movement has evolved through three separate phases in India. The first phase ran from the late 1960s through 1973. The second phase occurred from the late 1970s through 1994. The third and most significant phase formally began in 2004, reaching a peak of violence from 2005 to 2011 and declining to a nadir in 2014. A short review of the first two phases of the Naxalite insurgency establishes its patterns and India’s preferred security framework for dealing with this domestic stability threat. A more detailed review of the third and most noteworthy phase of the Naxalite insurgency follows in a subsequent section. First Phase, 1967–1973 Inspired by Maoist revolutionary tactics and the Cultural Revolution in China, the Naxalite movement gained momentum and began in the late 1960s and 1970s. Initially the movement centered in the Indian states of West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh (map 1). It featured peasants seizing land by force and then taking up arms to protect themselves against police and landlord response.29 Soon these rural activities merged with politically disillusioned and ideologically driven university students from Kolkata and other urban areas in India’s Far East—with active cells stretching from the state of Bihar in the north to Adhra Pradesh in the south. By 1969 un\u0002der charismatic leader Charu Mazumdar, the Naxalites organized as the CPI–Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) and attempted more centralized and violent tactics.30 CPI-ML moved to organize peasants and seize political power through guerilla warfare while focusing on annihilation of its class enemies.31 In urban areas such as Kolkata (then known as Calcutta), Naxalite insurgents 10 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 targeted police and local constables, attacking police outposts and patrols with an aim to cap\u0002ture weapons.32 Despite some limited weapons assistance and rhetorical support from Mao’s Communist government in the 1960s, China never undertook a strong campaign of support for the Nax\u0002alites.33 The Naxalites remained fragmented and without much training or organization. This first wave of Naxalite violence peaked in 1971 when over 3,650 acts of class-based attacks were reported and more than 850 people were reported killed. But it quickly succumbed to its own weaknesses and a state counterinsurgency response that featured two waves of activity. From the summer of 1969 through the end of 1971, state-led counterinsurgency campaigns against the rural Naxalite cadres decimated much of those insurgency cadres. State police, as\u0002sisted by the CRPF, moved against poorly armed Naxalites with great effect. By 1971 these po\u0002lice forces were joined by army units deployed into West Bengal. It took the failure of local and state police to contain Naxalite insurgents for more than 2 years before the West Bengal deputy chief minister—himself a politician from the CPI-Maoist party—requested assistance from a central paramilitary force, the Eastern Frontier Rifles, to assist state security forces. Then in July and August of 1971 a more dangerous component of the Naxalite insurgency in West Ben\u0002gal’s Birbhum District was put down by a joint campaign led by the army known as Operation Steeplechase. Army involvement only came after the collapse of an Indian National Congress– led coalition government in West Bengal and the New Delhi declaration of “President’s Rule” throughout the region. This made the central government responsible for the fight against the Naxalites and enabled Prime Minister Indira Ghandi to divert elements of the army massing along the East Pakistan border for what would become the December 1971 Indo-Pakistani War that assisted local police in decisive counterinsurgency operations.34 The urban dimension of the first wave of the Naxalite insurgency remained violent throughout 1971 and festered into the next 2 years, even as the rural component succumbed to Operation Steeplechase. Interparty political violence in Kolkata among the INC, CPI-M, and CPI-ML led to a swirl of assassinations and attacks against security forces and political leaders across urban areas. The election of a new West Bengal chief minister from the INC in March 1972 turned the tide on the urban Naxals. The law and order platform of Chief Minister Sid\u0002dharth Shankar Ray played out in a much more muscular police role across Kolkata and its surroundings throughout mid-1972 and into mid-1973. Kolkata police apprehended Naxalite leader Charu Maumdar in July 1972, and he died in custody several weeks later. Naxalite lead\u0002ers across the city succumbed to increasing police and state paramilitary presence. By 1973 the main cadres of the Naxalites had been eliminated and were dead or behind bars.35 11 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In this first Naxalite insurgent phase, the national government followed a pattern that would be repeated in subsequent phases. It did not forcibly intervene in the beginning. In keep\u0002ing with the federalist framework of the constitution, the government in New Delhi left it to local and state officials in West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and other afflicted states to take their own security actions to stop the threat. In the late 1960s, these state and local responses were often inadequate and ineffective.36 The central government only engaged with security forces once it had a critical mass of army forces in the region for the 1971–1972 war with Pakistan over Bangladesh and when the President’s Rule special authorities were in place, which enabled the military the power to make preventative arrests, search premises without a warrant, and shoot to kill civilians. Once engaged, the slowly evolving national response became one featuring intense force and coercion, eradicating the violence without eliminating the insurgency’s socio\u0002economic preconditions. Second Phase, 1977–1994 India’s first wave of insurgent violence ended badly for this domestic left-wing extremist movement but did not eliminate the conditions inspiring the movement or all of those willing to hold to the Naxalite cause. The movement fractured into more than 40 separate small groups.37 Slowly—over the course of a decade—these groups began to remobilize and consolidate. Par\u0002ticularly in the southeastern Indian state of Adhra Pradesh, a new Naxalite organization called People’s War emerged. Its leader, Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, sought a more efficient structure to boost morale, recruitment, and funding. By 1978 Naxalite peasant revolts had spread to the Karimnagar District of Telangana and Adilabad District of Adhra Pradesh. The major grievance was unpaid wages. Second-wave Naxalite insurgents kidnapped landlords and forced them to confess to crimes, apologize to villagers, and repay forced bribes. By the early 1980s insurgents had established a stronghold and sanctuary in the interlinked North Telangana village and Dan\u0002dakaranya forests areas along the Adhra Pradesh and Orissa border.38 In 1985 Naxalite insurgents began ambushing police. After they killed a police sub-inspec\u0002tor in Warangal, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh responded by creating a special task force called the Greyhounds to establish control in the seven worst affected districts. An elite anti-Naxalite commando unit that still exists today, the Greyhounds were drawn from within the Andhra Pradesh police forces and given special treatment. A 2,000-strong force in 2015, the Grey\u0002hounds were given preferred payment and training—better than federal or state paramilitary forces. They were also highly supported by the entire state police force. The Greyhounds played a minimal role in combatting the Naxalites during the second phase of the Maoist insurgency.39 12 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In 1987 the Naxalite political party (People’s War) and other Maoist groups in Andhra Pradesh were barred from elections after kidnapped government officials were exchanged for Naxalite prisoners. The ban was briefly lifted in 1991. In December of that year, however, insur\u0002gent attacks increased. Affected states responded by establishing special laws that enabled police to focus on capture, detention, and extra-normal means of violence against Naxalite cadres— fighters and presumed supporters.40 Adhra Pradesh and Orissa invited additional central para\u0002military forces in Telangana to augment state and federal government security forces already there. Besides brute force, the state set up rival mass organizations to attract youth away from the Naxalites, started rehabilitation programs, and established new informant networks.41 The new counterinsurgency strategy reduced violent incidents, and nearly 9,000 Naxalites surrendered. Consequently in 1994 the ban on ostensibly moderate Naxalite political parties was lifted.42 The second wave of the Naxalite insurgency had been stopped. However, and as at the end of the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency, the socioeconomic conditions underpin\u0002ning Naxalism remained largely unchanged in many regions of eastern India. Third Phase, 2004–2015 From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s the Naxalite insurgency remained largely out of the public eye, but the movement had not gone away. Taking advantage of rising local support for violent response to economic conditions, fragmented Naxalite groups created a united front: the People’s War, Party Unity, and the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) combined to form the People’s War Group (PWG). Naxalism manifested itself in episodic spurts of violence by the PWG, which had its most pronounced presence in Adhra Pradesh. From 1999–2002, local level violence increased. The PWG accelerated attacks on state government locations in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Chhattisgarh. By 2000 an estimated 3,000 armed Naxalite rebels were re\u0002portedly active in India’s east.43 During this time, Indian government agencies took actions that accelerated grievances among the poor and displaced with sympathies for left-wing violence. First, economic growth and development led to local and state government appropriation of land for infrastructure and resource development, displacing many underprivileged people who had no political voice. Second, governments responded to Naxalite violence with acute violence, reportedly includ\u0002ing the extra-judicial murder and torture of suspected rebels and rebel families.44 The MCC intensified its campaign of violence against Indian security forces and government agencies in 2002–2003 after its leader was killed by police.45 13 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In 2004, the PWG was superseded by the CPI-M.46 From this 2004 merger of the two larg\u0002est Naxalite factions—the PWG and MCC—into the CPI-M, Maoist ideology was fused with a cadre of armed groups for the first time.47 A third and more lethal wave of violence—more sophisticated and more destructive—rapidly spread throughout eastern India. Naxalite leaders expanded control over natural resource rich areas (for example, coal, gas, precious minerals, and timber). They also collected taxes and extortion money to fund weapons production, including the production of crude but effective improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Estimates from 2004 to 2011 suggest the Naxalites extracted at least $18.4 million annually from government offices, contractors, businessmen, and industrialists.They embarked upon more choreographed terror campaigns including the murder of local politicians, overwhelming attacks on local police sta\u0002tions, impressment of child soldiers, and a general campaign to scare away outside investors. By the second half of 2005, Naxalites demonstrated a lethality and reach far beyond the capacity of other domestic terrorist and insurgent groups. They destroyed buildings, captured weapons, and killed several local policemen in an attack on a village in Uttar Pradesh. They also attacked the Jehanabad Prison in Bihar, killing two, freeing more than 300 inmates, and abduct\u0002ing about 30 inmates who were members of an anti-Naxalite group. Total deaths from Naxalite\u0002attributed insurgency and terrorism grew to more than 800 in the impacted east and north\u0002eastern regions.48 In 2006 and 2007, this trend expanded. In 2006, Naxalite groups launched several high-profile attacks against civilians and security forces, expanding the rural territory under Maoist control and under threat of extreme violence. In one event, an attack by some 800 armed Naxalites in Chhattisgarh killed 25, injured 80 more, and saw some 250 people declared missing.49 In 2006, the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh grew concerned about the mounting threat posed by Naxalite groups to internal stability and democratic traditions across the east and southeast of India. The Naxalite menace had grown such that 18 of India’s federal states and 194 of its total districts were effected by Naxalite violence. For the first time Prime Minister Singh called the Naxalite/Maoist insurgency and associated terrorism “the sin\u0002gle biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”50 In 2007 Naxalite and Maoist violence reached an apex where it would remain for the next 4 years through 2010 (see map 2). Over 971 Naxalite attacks were recorded in the first seven months of 2007. That number would grow to over 1,500 attacks by the end of the year (see table51). Left-wing extremists began target\u0002ing elected officials including a member of the Indian parliament from Jharkhand state and the son of a former chief minister (or governor) of Andhra Pradesh.52 By 2010 the Naxalites were active in nine Indian states and reported to have a strong foot\u0002hold in parts of seven: West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, 14 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 and Maharashtra. This region happened to sit atop tremendous iron ore, coal, and aluminum deposits as well as irrigation and hydroelectric power potential. Across these states there were more than 2,200 incidents of Naxalite violence and almost 1,200 killed in 2010 alone (table).53 Map 2. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2007 15 India’s Naxalite Insurgency The threat to Indian national interests became obvious to the federal government and more co\u0002ordinated actions followed. From 2005 through 2010, Naxalite violence and the insufficient state-led, federally sup\u0002ported efforts to counter it cost India an average of more than 700 deaths per year. Most of these individuals were classified as civilian (see appendix A). Recruited from the disaffected rural poor, Naxalite cadres grew by 2010 to an estimated 20,000 armed fighters and an additional 50,000 supporters.54 In 2010, as he had first done in 2006, Prime Minister Singh trumpeted the risks of Naxalite violence to the stability and the ever important economic growth for the country. In May of that year, Prime Minister Singh referred to Naxalism as the “biggest internal security challenge” India has ever faced.55 The national government was understandably frustrated. From January to June 2009, India witnessed over 1,100 Naxalite-generated incidents of violence. These would double by the end of 2009 (table). Major violence occurred during national elections held from April to May 2009 as Naxalites called for an election boycott, attacked polling places, set off land mines, and even took control of a region of West Bengal known as Lalgarh. Paramilitary and police response operations against Naxalite locations were largely unsuccessful.56 Naxalite atrocities gained national notoriety. But simultaneously, accusations of systematic local police brutality and local and federal police human rights abuses against innocent civilians grew more vocal throughout the affected zones.57 In 2010 Naxalite violence inflicted 9 separate states of India and over 200 individual districts.58 Year 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 All Incidents 1,088 1,091 1,136 1,415 1,760 2,212 2,258 1,591 1,565 1,509 1,608 1,533 Attacks on Police 118 155 143 135 131 230 250 192 N/A 210 194 N/A Total Deaths 251 280 376 321 532 1,138 907 648 650 685 846 636 N/A = specific data not available Sources: “Left Wing Extremist (LWE) Data,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of Naxal Violence During 2008 to 2012,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of LWE Violence During 2011 to 2016 (up to 31.03.2016),” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; Government of India Ministry of Home Affairs, “Annual Reports,” available at. Table. Major Incidents During Naxalite Insurgency, Third Phase 16 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In March 2010, after months of prevarication and confusion, the national government launched Operation Green Hunt. The initiative added an additional estimated 20,000 federal paramilitary troops, mainly from the CRPF battalions, to existing state, local, and already pres\u0002ent Ministry of Home Affairs forces from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Border Security Forc\u0002es, and Shashastra Seema Bal.59 (See appendix B for detail on MHA special police units.) The operation sent federal, state, and local police and paramilitary forces into former no-go zones deep in the forests of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra states to rid them of militants, but these operations struggled. In April 2010, Naxalite insurgents ambushed 80 troops of the Indian Cen\u0002tral Police Security Forces (CPSF) in Chhattisgarh, killing an estimated 75 in the worst attack on Indian security forces since the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency began.60 In February 2011 Naxalites kidnapped two Indian government officials, demanding a halt to Green Hunt. The government agreed. The Naxalites also demanded the release of seven top imprisoned lead\u0002ers in exchange for the two officials. After a May 2011 Naxalite attack, 10 bodies of policemen were found dismembered in dense forest.61 Despite the major setbacks of 2010–2011, Indian federal and state authorities made some headway against a Naxalite insurgency now generating international headlines.62 Better coordi\u0002nated joint federal-state anti-Naxalite security operations killed a prominent Naxalite military leader, Koteswara Rao, in a November 2011 operation. In 2012 government paramilitary and police operations in West Bengal and Chhattisgarh began to produce results, with more than 1,800 Naxalite insurgents reported arrested and another 440 surrendered during the year.63 In late 2012 several Naxalite regional military leaders were captured and killed in those provinces. Acts of extreme violence continued during 2012 and 2013, but the expanse of the insur\u0002gency began to abate. Insurgency-related fatalities declined in 2012 and remained below 400 in 2013 (table). West Bengal reported sharp declines in Naxalite presence and activities dur\u0002ing 2013, although some observers declared that the decline in those states was offset by a corresponding increase of Naxalite violence in neighboring states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Orissa (appendix A). The Naxalites began the practice of including booby-trapping the bodies of dead Indian soldiers with IEDs in their stomachs. They killed national Congressman, and an\u0002ti-Naxalite militia Salwa Judum founder, Mahendra Karma in an attack on his convoy while he was campaigning for election in rural Chhattisgarh communities. Prime Minister Singh called for a two-pronged approach to dismantle the Naxalite network: sustaining joint and proactive military operations with greater economic development and responsible governance programs in the areas with strongest Maoist support. The CRPF successfully launched a 5-day interstate offensive in late December 2013 to dismantle core Maoist groups.64 It shut down a gun manu- 17 India’s Naxalite Insurgency facturing factory and recovered numerous weapons and explosives. Remote triggering devices were also found, indicating that the insurgency was using more advanced weaponry. By 2014 fatalities from Naxalite violence dropped below 300 for the first time in more than a decade (table). Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh remained most affected by the violence, and some Naxalite groups conducted operations and expanded into southern regions of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka states. But a review of the map in 2013 of Naxalite-impacted areas revealed a significant drop in the overall number of affected districts since 2007—from 165 to 120 overall—and an even more significant drop in districts categorized as experiencing severe or moderate amounts of violence from Naxalite activities over the same period—from 69 dis\u0002tricts in 2007 to just 28 in 2013 (see map 3). Eighty percent of Naxalite violence now afflicted only three states of India, down from the nine states impacted by serious Naxalite violence in 2010. On balance the tide had turned. By the end of 2014 the Naxalite insurgency was down if not out.65 In 2015, Indian joint security and economic efforts to counter the remaining Naxalite threat focused on 30 key districts in these 3 most impacted states, enabling more concentrated efforts matching gradually applied paramilitary enforcement with legal reforms and develop\u0002ment activities.66 As in the first two waves of Naxalite insurgency, the Indian federal-state government dis\u0002connect hampered its counterinsurgency efforts throughout the 2000s. Under the Indian con\u0002stitution, states bear the responsibility for enforcing law and order. When required, however, the federal government can send police and—under more limited conditions—military troops. In the case of federal police, assistance can come only upon request from the state government. In the case of military troops, assistance can come in the event of a state of emergency declara\u0002tion—as during the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency. Throughout the period from 2000 to 2010, the federal and state home (interior) ministries supervised multiple police and intelligence agencies without much unity of effort or command. An operation against Naxalite groups in the state of Bihar early in the 2000s faltered. Federal paramilitary border security forces in seven districts helped the local police, and millions of ru\u0002pees were promised in economic development opportunities. But the economic promises were broken, and poorly coordinated security operations only further alienated Naxalite moderates, derailing hoped for results by early 2002. In advance of 2004 elections in Chhattisgarh, the fed\u0002eral government sent 180 companies of paramilitary forces armed with helicopters and other advanced equipment. The Naxalites disappeared. Once the elections were over, federal troops and equipment departed and the Naxalites returned. 18 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 From the 2004 merger of Naxalite groups, the Indian government, particularly at the federal level, applied both carrots and sticks, incentivizing insurgents to pick constitutional remedies and brutally punishing those who refused. But the splits between state and federal authorities limited effectiveness. In part, state and local governments saw themselves in a co\u0002nundrum; they wanted an end to the organized Naxalite violence targeting them, their infra\u0002Map 3. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2013 19 India’s Naxalite Insurgency structure, and their legal enforcement structure. However, they did not want to alienate the vote banks across their states who sympathized with the Naxalite view of economic injustice but did not actively participate in violence. In one notable but far from unique instance, the chief minister (or governor) of the Naxalite-wracked state of Jharkhand won election in 2009 with strong insurgent sympathizer and insurgent vote bank support.67 State-level leaders de\u0002sired greater economic support from the central government, not overwhelming force, as the primary means to redress deeply held communist sympathies in their vote constituencies. Na\u0002tional political leaders within the INC empathized with these state-level concerns, offering some economic support and some additional policing support—but too little of either to make significant headway prior to 2010–2011. The politics of left-wing issues and voter concerns made effective coordination of counterinsurgency versus the Naxalites difficult. It took the extensive violence and loss of life between 2007 and 2010 to demonstrate the failure of an ill-coordinated approach. In 2009 the central government signaled that it wanted to provide 80,000 paramilitary and federal police to help in the fight, but these were too slowly fed into the region without strong local coordination. From the desperation of the peak year of Naxalite (CPI-Maoist) violence in 2010, and then–Prime Minister Singh’s second declaration that Maoist violence was India’s most grave internal security threat, a combination of state\u0002level requests and federal-level policy improvements paved the way for late-arriving successes against the Naxalites.68 The path to success was also paved by corresponding Naxalite failures. Beginning in 2010, the Indian federal government finally undertook several successful ini\u0002tiatives that slowly but steadily spanned the coordination gap between federal and state security forces and linked with improved local economic development aid.69 First, the government took steps to increase the costs to Maoist insurgent group operations—both financial and physical. Second, the central government deployed an additional 66 federal paramilitary security battal\u0002ions, CPSF and others, into the field where the insurgency had been winning against small and poorly trained local police. As noted above, these came slowly and in tranches between 2010 and 2014 but reached an impressive number of more than 200,000 by early 2014.70 India’s mili\u0002tary and its special operations forces (SOF) have not participated directly in the third phase of Naxalite counterinsurgency operations. Instead, SOF units have provided indirect assistance— offering specialized training to Indian Central Armed Police Forces (see appendix B) preparing to deploy to the anti-Maoist counterinsurgency fight.71 Third, the federal government built 444 new police stations in affected areas and regenerated the policing capability in them.72 Fourth, the government established a civil development program in the worst affected areas. Finally, government security forces worked more effectively in a combined action environment where 20 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 economic development and human rights were established in the communities most vulnerable to Naxalite recruiting and propaganda.73 These five national factors interacted with several organizational failures by the Naxalites themselves. First, the Maoists failed to generate a message of systematic economic exploitation to the degree necessary for serious attention in Indian urban areas, where the gulf between rich and poor was great and growing every year. Second, despite their highly publicized violence, the Naxalites never won the “mindspace” in India; the Maoist ideology of class conflict gener\u0002ated limited appeal outside of primitive and tribal areas in India, never resonating in urban ar\u0002eas other than with a marginalized group of activist university students.74 Indian youth moved onto other causes and other areas of activism in the wider Indian economy.75 Third, Naxalites proved to be their own worst enemies. They often splintered into criminal syndicates deal\u0002ing narcotics and running both extortion and kidnapping rackets. This profiteering, evident from as early as 2009–2010, revealed that Naxalism was less about communist ideology or well-coordinated violent insurgent activity and much more about local and regional organized criminal activity, which exploits rather than benefits the lower class (and lower caste) Indian Hindus who live there.76 In self-reflective statements, ministry-level officials in the Indian federal government ac\u0002knowledged that most Naxalite gains before 2010 had come too often because local govern\u0002ments and security officials incorrectly assessed and mishandled the problems of the disgrun\u0002tled Indian minority groups in rural areas. At the same time the central government remained tepid in its involvement—unable to induce state governments to request more assertive federal security assistance and caught in a political conundrum where some of the state government leadership was both courting Naxalite sympathizer votes while simultaneously fighting Naxalite militant cadres. Once the federal government got serious and increased paramilitary security presence with a wider number of local economic development programs, the Naxalites began to wane.77 Attention to a holistic approach by the Indian central government caused the worst of the Naxalite insurgency to recede in a visible manner.78 In 2016 the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India remains a security factor, but one far from the menace publicly announced by then–Prime Minister Singh in 2006 and again in 2010.79 Instead it is now much more of a nuisance, largely a constellation of organized criminal enter\u0002prises with a loose affiliation to a Maoist credo than an ideological insurgency. The socioeco\u0002nomic factors that inspire Naxalite groups remain in place, and this insurgency could again evolve into a more serious threat to local security agents in India. In the poor eastern districts of India, the possibility of a fourth wave of Naxalite insurgency cannot be dismissed if the rich 21 India’s Naxalite Insurgency continue to get richer without the benefits of economic growth filtering down to the people who really need it.80 India’s long slog toward corralling the third phase of its Naxalite insurgency again demon\u0002strated the challenges and strengths of its counterinsurgency framework. State and local govern\u0002ment police forces must fail obviously and admit to their failures before major federal assistance can come forward. Left-wing (or communist) inspired violence mixes awkwardly with Indian electoral politics in many eastern states of the country. Communist political party voters often sympathize with Naxalite grievances but not their violent means. State and local officials thus have incentives to take uncertain and indecisive action with their police and security forces. Too often, they can tolerate incompetence and even human rights abuses by local-level counterin\u0002surgency police and militias, exacerbating wider grievances. They appeal for national economic help while avoiding national security help out of a fear that too much outside intervention might harm their local political interests. Federal-level forces, when these do arrive, come with their own issues. They can lack local knowledge and fail to be sensitive to popular culture and traditions. This leaves them vulnerable to insurgent ambush and to charges of torture or human rights abuses from an uncertain or frightened local population. U.S. Security Engagement with Indian Ministry of Home Affairs U.S. engagement with India in the areas of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency has developed over a 16-year period from January 2000. This engagement has advanced along three parallel lines of interaction. One line has been through bilateral dialogue and exercises between U.S. and Indian SOF, which have focused on counterterrorism training events and conversa\u0002tions. A second line has been through collaboration between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Indian Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This collaboration has focused on criminal investigative techniques; port, rail, and maritime security training and best practices; and a general growth in liaison and information exchange between respective special police and border security agencies. A third line of interaction has evolved in more general bilateral military-to-military exchanges between the national armies, navies, air forces, and coast guards. Advancements in each of these areas have been noteworthy but not comprehensive. For all the noteworthy advances, limitations have remained, especially when it comes to the matter of outside assistance for Indian units and organizations conducting domestic counterinsurgency. The history of special operations training and exercising is most noteworthy. Bilateral U.S.- Indian SOF have undertaken joint exercises that work on interoperability in counterterror\u0002ism and counterinsurgency operation skills and drills. Small-scale counterterrorism training 22 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 exercises have been conducted on a recurring basis since 2002, including exercises in India’s northeast territories where longstanding domestic insurgencies continue.81 Under the broad definition of U.S.-India maritime security cooperation, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) SOF also have been training Indian military special forces officers in counterterrorism, learning from Indian counterterrorism experiences at the same time. In the main, these exercises have focused upon special techniques and capabilities for SOF activities in counterterrorism opera\u0002tions (see appendix C). Despite a decade of offers by U.S. senior commanders and defense officials, Indian leaders declined to have U.S. SOF engage with or provide direct assistance to the MHA paramilitary and police forces optimized for domestic counterterrorism or counterinsurgency operations.82 But in October 2015, India, for the first time, welcomed U.S. SOF to a joint training exercise with its MHA counterterrorism unit, the National Security Guards (NSG).83 This was a meaningful step forward and, as most observers believe, became possible only after the change in perspective ac\u0002companying the government of Prime Minister Modi. Yet the limit of U.S. SOF interaction with that of only the NSG—the single special police unit focused on counterterrorism rather than counterinsurgency operations—is telling. After more than a decade of U.S. offers, the Indian government still remains uncomfortable about direct bilateral counterinsurgency training with its large array of MHA domestic counterinsurgency forces. Washington and New Delhi first established the U.S.-India Counterterrorism Joint Work\u0002ing Group (JWG) in January 2000. Among more than a dozen major steps, the United States and India initiated antiterrorism training programs for Indian law enforcement officials and began a dialogue on cooperation in homeland and internal security.84 First, these programs involved lim\u0002ited military-to-military counterterrorism engagements. Then, after the November 2008 Mum\u0002bai terrorist attack, a more formal set of interactions between DHS and MHA counterterrorism and law enforcement officials began to take shape. Notably, however, neither of these lines of engagement have witnessed the MHA welcoming direct U.S. military or special police assistance for its special police or border police engaged in combating the Naxalite insurgency. In September 2005, USPACOM conducted a counterterrorism tabletop exercise that brought together Indian and American military, diplomatic, law enforcement, and humanitari\u0002an assistance leaders. A U.S. National Guard unit co-trained with Indian troops at India’s Coun\u0002ter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School in Mizoram. U.S. antiterrorism assistance advanced again after the November 2008 terrorist attacks in the commercial district of Mumbai. The U.S. Department of State’s Antiterrorism Assistance Program (ATA) provided enhanced training 23 India’s Naxalite Insurgency consultations with senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officials on the topics of hotel security, rail security, responses to an active shooter incident, as well as major event security management.85 In 2010, the two governments began the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. Since then the dialogue has enabled bilateral cooperation on mutual strategic interests and strengthened “security cooperation through expanded dialogues and exercises as well as shar\u0002ing of advanced technologies.”86 A subsequent 2010 U.S.-India Counterterrorism Cooperation Initiative allows the United States to facilitate capacity-building and training in India across a number of specific areas, including but not limited to: ■ developing investigative skills ■ promoting cooperation between forensic science laboratories ■ establishing procedures to provide mutual investigative assistance ■ improving capabilities to act against money-laundering, counterfeit currency, and terrorist financing ■ trading best practices on mass transit and rail security ■ increasing interactions between coast guards and navies on maritime security ■ exchanging experience and expertise on port and border security ■ enhancing liaison and training between specialist counterterrorism units, including the National Security Guard and its U.S. counterparts.87 Beginning in February 2012, American trainers under the ATA have been training Indian police in cooperation with the MHA. This training includes forensic examination of terrorist crime scenes and advanced explosives incident countermeasures. These courses are also available to state police, for example, in Kolkata (West Bengal). Intelligence agencies of both countries are sharing resources to support specific counterterrorism operations.88 These training courses have had a positive impact upon hundreds of Indian local and national police, including IPS. They have also engaged some members of the MHA special police units such as the Indo-Tibetan Bor\u0002der Police and CPSF. Noteworthy and prudent, these bits of individual training have occurred 24 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 with individual Indian police and paramilitary officers and jawans (junior paramilitary soldiers) who have later participated in counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites and other rebel groups.89 At the same time, though, direct U.S. military engagement with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and security forces units involved in domestic counterinsurgency has remained limited. American military interactions with regular Indian army units also have grown in an im\u0002pressive manner over the past decade. As discussed earlier, Indian, just as American, military and defense leaders are keen to state that India has more joint military training events and exer\u0002cises with the United States than with any other defense partner worldwide.90 Yet India’s civilian defense establishment leadership appears amenable to many military-to-military training and exercise interactions with the United States but continues to view access to military technology to be the litmus test of fruitful bilateral defense relations.91 Although the Indian military highly prizes joint service-to-service interactions and exer\u0002cises, no U.S. military units have been engaged with or even indirectly assisted Indian central police or paramilitary units directly involved in the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations against the Naxalites. In those instances in which the U.S. military and DHS per\u0002sonnel have had interaction with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and paramilitary forces, the rule has been that indirect general skills training is acceptable for Indian leadership, but specific engagement and activities directly with Indian domestic insurgency forces is alto\u0002gether something else. Some analysts have recommended that the United States formally inject direct domestic counterinsurgency assistance into the U.S.-India security relationship. In 2013, one such ana\u0002lyst, Haider Ali Hussein Mullick, made a robust proposal, stating that the United States should formally generate a $400 million India counterinsurgency initiative, jointly run by the Depart\u0002ment of Defense (DOD), State, and DHS.92 He proposed that this initiative should bundle to\u0002gether the indirect assistance provided by the ATA and DOD International Military Education and Training program, as well as establish a Foreign Military Finance Account for India (where one then did not exist) and apportion other money into DHS and Justice department accounts to better enable Federal Bureau of Information resources for its India-focused international po\u0002lice training program. In this well-intentioned recommendation, U.S. largesse could be used to provide vital equipment to India’s CRPF, including armored personnel vehicles, mine-resistant vehicles, flak jackets, GPS trackers, and night-vision goggles. As Indian attack helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were deemed vital for providing counterinsurgency ground 25 India’s Naxalite Insurgency support, this proposal provided for U.S. funding to assist the Indian air force in creating dedi\u0002cated air surveillance and support for the CRPF—including helicopter and UAV support.93 Noble in intent, Mullick’s recommendation of a major U.S. push to provide direct assis\u0002tance to Indian domestic counterinsurgency units and operations remains as misguided today as it was in 2013. Likewise, periodic offers by U.S. defense officials of direct U.S. military assis\u0002tance to Indian counterinsurgency forces are similarly well intentioned but off target.94 These and similar initiatives ultimately push unhelpfully against Indian protection of its absolute sov\u0002ereignty in domestic counterinsurgency operations. Moreover, even if India were to unexpect\u0002edly welcome direct U.S. military and whole-of-government support for its domestic counter\u0002insurgency activities, that very success would create significant problems for the growing but delicate U.S.-India security relationship. These problems are evident in the patterns observed during Indian counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites. Direct American support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations (such as those against the Naxalites) would quickly expose significant divergence between views in Washington and Indian cultural and political concerns with its domestic insurgents. First, In\u0002dians are historically tolerant of long, protracted counterinsurgency operations, including the four-and-a-half-decade Naxalite rebellion, a six-decade swirl of insurgency in northeast India, and the insurgency and rebellion extant in Jammu and Kashmir since 1947. American patience with such protracted counterinsurgency operations has not been a hallmark of its international ventures over the past century. Second, Indian domestic insurgencies have a political cadence and rhythm about them that is alien to American sensibilities. In all three phases of the Naxalite insurgency, state and local political dynamics played to Naxalite sympathizer vote banks, allowing insurgent activi\u0002ties to grow to an uncomfortable level. In the second phase and especially the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency, Indian national police and paramilitary assistance began with limited but targeted security help for local authorities that focused upon managing major events—like election security—but then quickly vanished. Only when the political calculus of local, state, and national officials aligned did coordinated and effective policing, paramilitary, and local as\u0002sistance programs come together. American patience with the dynamics of this Indian political rhythm would be sorely tried. Third, with much of India’s Naxalite insurgency featuring organized criminal activity as its underpinning by 2014–2016, it is arguably more useful and feasible for the United States and India to focus meaningful collaboration on individual policing techniques and investigative activities to counter these dimensions of residual Naxalism. There will be less Indian resistance 26 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 to this kind of DHS-to-MHA support. Thereafter, the focus of the U.S. military and its SOF can then better orient on wider regional and international counterterrorism activities. In addition to these historically supported cautions, direct American training and equip\u0002ment support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations might run afoul of U.S. legisla\u0002tive mandates and human rights standards. All U.S. assistance to foreign security forces must conform to what is known as the Leahy Law, named for legislative author Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). One part of the law applies to State Department foreign assistance programs and the second applies to DOD training and assistance programs for the security forces of a foreign country. Both versions prohibit any U.S. security assistance if the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense have credible information that a military, paramilitary, or police unit of a foreign government has committed a gross violation of human rights in the conduct of its activities— past or present. The law allows for an exception (or waiver) permitting resumption of security assistance if the Secretary of State or Defense reports to Congress that the government of the assisted country is taking effective steps to bring the violating members of the security forces to justice.95 Direct U.S. assistance to India’s paramilitary and police units combatting the Naxalite insurgency (as others) could quickly run into a problem with the Leahy Law. There have been frequent reports of Indian local police units’ involvement in human rights violations against innocents in the Naxalite insurgency areas.96 Indian central policy forces, including units from the CRPF, have been accused of human rights abuses and torture against apprehended militants and presumed supporters in Naxalite-afflicted areas.97 It is hard to imagine Indian pride react\u0002ing well to American demands for certification of the human rights corrections made on its national counterinsurgency paramilitary forces. It also is hard to imagine the U.S.-India security relationship holding up well if, in order to secure training and equipment for its already well-supported national paramilitary units, New Delhi must face repetitive Leahy Law inquiries. Indeed, in a country with growing wealth and a proud belief in the relative successes of its autonomous, indigenous paramilitary counterin\u0002surgency forces, U.S. direct assistance (with strings) is not likely to be well received.98 At the least, such conditioned assistance would strain security relations that both sides desire to see improve. At the worst, the outcome might set back bilateral security progress on far more im\u0002portant U.S.-India security initiatives including those involving joint maritime security activi\u0002ties in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean, interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence sharing and broader operations. 27 India’s Naxalite Insurgency Lessons Learned and Policy Implications for U.S.-India Relations A review of the history of Indian approach to dealing with its Naxalite insurgency indi\u0002cates the unique nature of New Delhi’s approach to domestic security. The limited engagement with the United States on military and security assistance offers also indicates the continuing barriers inhibiting a deep and unbridled bilateral security alliance at this time. A decade of U.S. interaction with India on the Naxalite insurgency reinforces the notion that Washington should not expect New Delhi to become a tightly coupled military ally anytime soon. Instead, New Del\u0002hi is more likely to be a friendly strategic partner with the United States where mutual security interests align, while interacting more often in a restrained and limited manner where U.S. and Indian security interests and prerogatives do not well align—as in the case of the Naxalites.99 Given this insight, U.S. policymakers should focus on bilateral counterterrorism and coun\u0002terinsurgency security cooperation efforts toward externally sponsored Islamist terrorist groups and, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, against actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns. As a complement, U.S. military assistance programs focusing on technical skills and practices for individual Indian police, paramilitary, and SOF will remain most promising and prominent for the foreseeable future. 28 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Appendix A.

Under the reciprocal agreement, both New Delhi and Washington would have the ability, but not the obligation, to assist each other’s armed forces with simple military logistics. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) would allow the United States to supply India with its proprietary encrypted communications equipment and systems, allowing secure peacetime and wartime communication between high-level military leaders on both sides. CISMOA would extend this capability to Indian and U.S. military assets, including aircraft and ships. The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) would set a framework through which the United States could share sensitive data to aid targeting and navigation with India.

On May 22, there were nearly simultaneous bombings of two movie theaters in New Delhi by a Sikh terrorist organization, Babbar Khalsa International, which many thought was defunct. The attacks left 1 person dead and more than 60 injured. On October 29, a series of explosions in crowded marketplaces and on a public bus in New Delhi killed approximately 60 and injured more than 150 on the eve of Diwali, India’s most important Hindu holiday. The Indian government blamed the designated foreign terrorist organiza\u0002tion Lashkar e-Tayyiba for the attack.

But it also came about after Naxalite groups began to focus on controlling areas rich in natural resources such as iron and destroying state infrastructure such as railroads, telephone exchanges, and industrial plants. By 2010 Naxalite presence overlapped critical areas such as Bihar, Jharkhand, and Orissa, which contain the bulk of India’s iron ore, and Andhra Pradesh has large reserves of bauxite, 38 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 key inputs to Indian industry. Naxalites had also come to dominate areas containing 85 percent of the country’s coal resources, which are used to power 55 percent of India’s energy supply and 75 percent of its electricity. These economic realities made piecemeal solutions and state-level toleration of Naxalite activities untenable—driving better coordination. See “Left Wing Extremism (LWE) Division,” available at.

These offers have been politely declined by mid\u0002level Indian Ministry of Defence and MHA leaders. 94 “Leahy Fact Sheet,” Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights & Labor, March 3, 2016, available at. 95 “India: Draconian Response to Naxalite Violence,” Human Rights Watch, April 27, 2006, available at; Azaan Javaid, “Maharashtra Police Used to Torture Me: JNU Student Hem Mishra,” DNAIndia.com, September 27, 2015, available at. 40 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 96 Verma, 307, 313; “CRPF Personnel Death in Naxal No Human Rights Violation,” Busi\u0002nessStandard.com, May 25, 2014, available at. 97 Well-intentioned, but ill-timed conditionality on U.S. security assistance has harmed bilateral relations with aspiring strategic partners in several historic instances. Most recently, U.S. congressional conditionality on the Kerry-Berman-Lugar strategic assistance package to Pakistan of 2009 requiring that Pakistan’s military relinquish absolute control of its general officer selection process to civilian oversight substantially strained U.S.-Pakistan relations at a moment that Washington aimed to make them tighter. India in 2016 is not Pakistan of 2009, but the caution against unhelpful conditionality remains a worthy one. See S. 1707, “Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009,” 111th Cong., 1st sess.

Muzamil Mattoo/NurPhoto via Getty A deadly militant attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, has triggered a [sharp escalation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/world/asia/pakistan-india-kashmir-attack.html) between India and Pakistan, with both sides exchanging gunfire across the Line of Control and downgrading diplomatic ties. On May 6, India announced the launch of “Operation Sindoor,” a military strike [targeting nine sites](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/multiple-loud-explosions-heard-pakistani-kashmir-reuters-witness-2025-05-06/) in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Jammu and Kashmir, which it alleged were used to plan the attacks. The situation has heightened fears of a broader military conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations, marking the most significant bilateral confrontation since 2019. ## Background The conflict between India and Pakistan arose out of the 1947 [Partition](https://www.britannica.com/event/Partition-of-India) of British India. The Partition established a Muslim-majority Pakistan and a Hindu-majority India and provided the diverse regions of Jammu and Kashmir the opportunity to choose which country to [accede](https://peacekeeping.un.org/mission/past/unipombackgr.html) to. The _maharaja_(Kashmir’s monarch) initially sought [independence](https://uca.edu/politicalscience/home/research-projects/dadm-project/asiapacific-region/indiakashmir-1947-present/#:~:text=Maharaja%20Hari%20Singh%20signed%20the,Singh%20on%20October%2030%2C%201947.), as Kashmir was [neglected](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2019/8/15/kashmirs-struggle-did-not-start-in-1947-and-will-not-end-today) and subjugated for centuries by conquering empires. However, he ultimately agreed to join India in exchange for help against invading Pakistani herders, triggering the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-48. The Karachi Agreement of 1949 temporarily ended violence in the Jammu-Kashmir region by establishing a cease-fire line (CFL) [overseen](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/karachi_agreement_1949.pdf) by members of a UN truce subcommittee. Tensions simmered until a skirmish between border controls [escalated](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/india-pakistan-war) to a full-blown war in 1965. In 1971, India and Pakistan fought another [brief war](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2019/12/16/remembering-the-war-of-1971-in-east-pakistan) over East Pakistan, with Indian forces helping the territory gain independence, resulting in the establishment of present-day Bangladesh. India and Pakistan attempted to usher in a new era of bilateral relations with the [1972 Simla Agreement](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/simla_agreement_1972.pdf), which established the [Line of Control](https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2016/09/30/what-is-the-line-of-control-the-short-answer/) (LOC). This provisional military control line split Kashmir into two administrative regions. However, in 1974, the conflict took on a new dimension with the introduction of [nuclear weapons](https://armscontrolcenter.org/countries/india-and-pakistan/), raising the stakes of any confrontation. That year, India [tested](https://armscontrolcenter.org/history-of-conflict-in-india-and-pakistan/) its first nuclear weapon, triggering a nuclear arms race that would see Pakistan reach that same milestone two decades later. In 1989, Pakistan [capitalized](https://carnegieendowment.org/2003/07/01/pakistan-s-endgame-in-kashmir-pub-1427) upon a burgeoning resistance movement in Indian-administered Kashmir to undermine Indian control, reigniting tensions and beginning decades of [communal violence](https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/india-pakistan-kashmir/violence-kashmir-why-spike-killings-signals-ominous-new-trend). Despite a recommitment to the LOC in 1999, Pakistani soldiers crossed the LOC, sparking the [Kargil War](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49101016). Although both countries have maintained a fragile [cease-fire](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/9/will-the-india-pakistan-ceasefire-pact-along-kashmir-border-hold) since 2003, they regularly exchange fire across the contested border. Both sides accuse the other of violating the cease-fire and claim to be shooting in response to attacks. On November 26, 2008, fears that India and Pakistan would once again head towards direct military confrontation rose after militants laid siege to the Indian capital of Mumbai. Over three days, 166 people [were killed](https://www.cfr.org/blog/decade-will-there-ever-be-justice-mumbai-attacks), including 6 Americans. Both India and the United States [blamed](https://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/27/mumbai.world.reaction/index.html) the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a militant group with alleged ties to the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)—Pakistan’s primary intelligence agency—for perpetrating the attack. The Indian government [cooperated](https://www.icct.nl/publication/decade-2008-mumbai-attack-reviewing-question-state-sponsorship) with the Pakistani government to bring the perpetrators to justice, paving the way for improved relations. In 2014, many hoped India would pursue meaningful peace negotiations with Pakistan after India’s newly elected Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, [invited](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27554193) Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to attend his inauguration. After a brief period of optimism, relations soured in August 2014 when India [canceled](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/world/asia/india-cancels-talks-after-pakistani-envoy-meets-with-separatists.html) talks with Pakistan’s foreign minister after the Pakistani high commissioner in India met with Kashmiri separatist leaders. Momentum toward meaningful talks halted in September 2016, when armed militants [attacked](https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/18/asia/india-kashmir-attack/) a remote Indian Army base in Uri, near the LOC, killing eighteen Indian soldiers in the deadliest attack on the Indian armed forces in decades. Indian officials [accused](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/19/world/asia/17-indian-soldiers-killed-by-militants-in-kashmir.html) Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), another group with alleged ties to ISI, of conducting the attack. In response, the Indian military [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/world/asia/kashmir-india-pakistan.html) it had carried out “surgical strikes” on terrorist camps inside Pakistani-administered Kashmir. In contrast, the Pakistani military denied that any such operation had taken place. This period was marked by an uptick in border skirmishes that began in late 2016 and continued into 2018, [killing](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/villagers-flee-india-pakistan-trade-heavy-border-fire-180225175630432.html) dozens and [displacing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/world/asia/kashmir-shelling-family.html) thousands of civilians on both sides of the Line of Control. More than three thousand cross-border strikes were reported in 2017, while nearly one thousand were reported in the first half of 2018. Militants launched attacks in October 2017 against an [Indian paramilitary camp](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-41479633) near Srinagar and, in February 2018, against an [Indian army base](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/world/asia/jammu-base-attack.html) in the Jammu region, which killed five soldiers and a civilian. During this time, violent demonstrations and anti-India [protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/world/asia/kashmir-india-pakistan-unrest.html) calling for an independent Kashmir also [continued](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/world/asia/kashmir-india-rebels.html). Over three hundred people, including civilians, Indian security forces, and militants, were killed in attacks and clashes in 2017. After months of Indian military operations targeting both Kashmiri militants and demonstrations, India [announced](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/india-calls-ceasefire-kashmir-holy-month-ramadan-180516172240117.html) in May 2018 that it would observe a cease-fire in Kashmir during the month of Ramadan for the first time in nearly two decades; operations [resumed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/southasia/2018/06/india-resumes-military-operations-kashmir-180617170344005.html) in June 2018. Later in May, India and Pakistan formally agreed to a [cease-fire](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-truce.html) along the disputed Kashmir border that would restore the terms of their [2003 agreement](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2018/06/09/pakistan-and-indias-revival-of-ceasefire-agreement-2003-and-need-to-formalize-it/). In February 2019, an attack on a convoy of Indian paramilitary forces in Pulwama, Indian-administered Kashmir, killed at least forty soldiers. The attack, claimed by the Pakistani militant group JeM, was the [deadliest in Kashmir](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/world/asia/pulwama-attack-kashmir.html) in three decades. India retaliated with an [air strike](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-05/features/pulwama-crisis-flirting-war-nuclear-environment) targeting terrorist training camps within Pakistani territory, which was followed by Pakistani air strikes on Indian-administered Kashmir. The exchange escalated into an [aerial engagement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pakistan-says-it-has-shot-down-two-indian-jets-in-its-airspace/2019/02/27/054461a2-3a5b-11e9-a2cd-307b06d0257b_story.html), during which Pakistan shot down two Indian military aircraft and captured an Indian pilot; the pilot was [released](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/world/asia/india-pakistan-plane-abhinandan-varthaman-india.html) two days later. In August 2019, following a [deployment](https://www.apnews.com/3fba5daae33c499c95e89a76828e9afc) of tens of thousands of additional troops and paramilitary forces to the region, the Indian government moved to [revoke Article 370](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49234708) of the Indian constitution. The change removed Jammu and Kashmir’s [special status](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/kashmir-what-know-about-disputed-region), forcing Kashmiris to abide by Indian property and customary law and effectively diminishing their autonomy. The ruling not only angered Kashmiris but was also viewed as a “ [grave injustice](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pakistan-view-article-370-9071693/)” by Pakistan. The removal of Article 370 signified the more aggressive approach of the Modi government to integrate Kashmir into India through a doctrine of [Hindu nationalism](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/hindu-nationalism-and-its-impact-on-kashmir/). Following the revocation of Article 370, India-administered Kashmir remained under [lockdown](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/23/kashmir-city-srinagar-india-lockdown-calls-protest-march) for over a year, with internet and phone services intermittently cut off and [thousands of people](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-kashmir-detentions/thousands-detained-in-indian-kashmir-crackdown-official-data-reveals-idUSKCN1VX142) detained. In 2022 and 2023, the Indian central government [cracked down](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/23/as-india-holds-g20-meet-brutal-kashmir-media-crackdown-slammed) on independent media in the region, [redrew](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/6/kashmir-india-election-map-delimitation-commission-jammu) the electoral map to privilege Hindu-majority areas in Kashmir, and held a [G20 tourism meeting](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65666467) in Srinagar. [Targeted killings](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/world/asia/india-kashmir-hindu-pandits-attacks.html) against Hindus have become more frequent, motivating some to flee and protest government policies. In response to the uptick in violence, the Modi government has taken an increasingly [militarized response](https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/india-pakistan-kashmir/violence-kashmir-why-spike-killings-signals-ominous-new-trend). Deadly clashes between Indian and Pakistani forces also [persisted](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-says-civilian-killed-by-indian-gunfire-kashmir-boundary-2023-08-21/) in 2023. ## Recent Developments Throughout 2024, violence continued in Kashmir in response to increasing efforts by New Delhi to consolidate territorial control. Attacks specifically targeted Indian travelers and workers in the region. In June 2024, militants [opened fire on a bus](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/9/at-least-nine-killed-after-attack-on-bus-in-indian-administered-kashmir) carrying pilgrims traveling to a Hindu shrine in the town of Reasi. The attack killed nine and injured over thirty. In October, militants [killed seven](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/21/gunmen-kill-seven-people-working-on-key-tunnel-project-in-indias-kashmir) in Kashmir at a construction site for a [tunnel project](https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-modi-inaugurates-a-strategic-tunnel-in-disputed-kashmir/7934753.html) connecting Kashmir to the northern region of Ladakh. On April 22, 2025, tensions escalated after militants attacked Indian tourists in Kashmir, killing twenty-five Indian nationals and one Nepalese national. The incident marked the deadliest terrorist attack in Indian territory since the 2008 Mumbai attacks. India blamed Pakistan for harboring the group responsible for the attack and arrested two Pakistani nationals as suspects. Pakistan [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/world/asia/pakistan-india-kashmir-attack.html) any involvement, and its defense ministry even [suggested](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/4/24/kashmir-attack-live-india-summons-pakistani-envoy-hunts-pahalgam-gunmen) the attack was a “false flag operation.” Although no group has been officially identified as responsible for the attack, the Kashmir Resistance—an offshoot of LeT—claimed responsibility online. In the wake of the attack, tit-for-tat measures by India and Pakistan have driven bilateral relations to their lowest point in recent years. New Delhi first [took measures](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kashmir-attack-india-pakistan-indus-water-treaty-revoked/) to downgrade ties with Pakistan, suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, terminating a visa-free travel regime with Pakistan, and closing the Attari border crossing between the two countries. In turn, Pakistan [rejected](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/what-is-indus-waters-treaty-between-india-pakistan-2025-04-24/) the suspension of the water treaty, warning that any attempts to alter Pakistan’s Indus River flows would be considered “an act of war.” Islamabad [also moved](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-calls-all-party-meet-summons-top-pakistani-diplomat-after-kashmir-attack-2025-04-24/) to close Pakistani airspace to all Indian commercial airlines, halted a special visa regime for Indian citizens, and suspended bilateral trade. Indian and Pakistani forces have [exchanged fire](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/india-pakistan-exchange-small-arms-fire-across-kashmir-border-fourth-night-2025-04-28/) across the LOC every day since the attack. The United States and China have called for de-escalation, with Beijing advocating for an independent investigation into the attack and its suspects. Islamabad and New Delhi have since traded military threats, with India’s navy [testing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/india-test-fires-missiles-tensions-rise-pakistan-kashmir-attack?utm_source=dailybrief&utm_content=20250428&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DailyNewsBrief2025Apr28&utm_term=DailyNewsBrief) long-range missiles. On April 28, Pakistan’s defense ministry [expressed belief](https://www.reuters.com/world/pakistan-defence-minister-says-military-incursion-by-india-is-imminent-2025-04-28/) that an Indian military attack on Pakistani territory was “imminent” and that the Pakistan military was preparing reinforcements. Meanwhile, India has [launched a crackdown](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/27/nx-s1-5378630/india-kashmir-pakistan-crackdown-homes-destroyed) in Kashmir, as Indian security forces have arrested over 1,500 Kashmiris and demolished homes of suspected militants.

The slain Maoists were identified as Gautam Paswan, CPI-Maoist ‘Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee (BJSAC)’ member, who had a reward of INR 2.5 million on his head; Ajit Oraon _alias_ Charlis, BJSAC member, with an INR 2.5 million reward; Amar Ganjhu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; Ajay Yadav _alias_ Nandu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; and Sanjeet Bhuiyan, ‘sub-zonal commander’. During the search operation, the dead bodies of the five Maoists along with two AK-47 rifles, one INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, two other rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as items of daily use were recovered. On April 1, 2023, a CPI-Maoist cadre, Sameer Mohonda _alias_ Sadhu Linga (31), a member of the CPI-Maoist ‘Chatgaon Local Organizational Squad’, with a reward of INR 200,000 on his head, was killed in an encounter with C-60 Commandos in the Kiarkoti-Abujhmad Forest area of Bhamragarh _Taluka_ (revenue division) in the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra. Acting on intelligence inputs, the Commandos launched an operation and came under indiscriminate fire from a group of 60 to 70 Maoists hiding in the forest, who used Under Barrel Grenade Launchers (UBGLs) and other weapons. In the retaliatory fire, the C-60 Commandos killed one Maoist, while the others managed to flee into the dense forest. After the firing, which lasted for approximately an hour, the Security Forces (SFs) searched the area and recovered one .303 rifle, one gun, a country-made pistol, three magazines, 31 bullets, INR 38,000, medicines, Maoist literature and other materials. On March 28, 2023, a former deputy _Sarpanch_ (head of the _Panchayat_, village level local self-Government institution), Ramji Dodi, was abducted and killed by CPI-Maoist cadres in Zara village in the Narayanpur District of Chhattisgarh. Dodi was abducted, along with his two nephews, and taken to a forest where he was allegedly strangled to death by the Maoists. The nephews were released with Ramji’s body and a letter saying that he was killed because he was a ‘police informer’. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), there has been a total of 39 fatalities (20 civilians, nine SF personnel and 10 _Naxalites_, Left Wing Extremists) in Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-linked violence in the current year (data till April 9, 2023). During the corresponding period of 2022, the number of such fatalities was 49 (19 civilians, seven SF personnel and 23 _Naxalites_). Through 2022, there was a total of 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) in such violence. In the preceding year (2021), there was a total of 237 fatalities (58 civilians, 51 SF personnel, and 128 _Naxalites_). Overall fatalities were at 239 in 2020, 302 in 2019, 412 in 2018 and 335 in 2017. Overall fatalities have, thus, been on a decline since 2019. Moreover, the overall fatalities in 2022 were the lowest recorded in a single year since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE. Interestingly, the overall fatalities in 2021 were the pervious lowest recorded in a single year. A peak of 1,180 fatalities (630 civilians, 267 SF personnel, 265 _Naxalites_ and 18 unspecified) were recorded in 2010. As with overall fatalities, fatalities in 2022 in all three categories – civilian, SF and _Naxalite_ – were the lowest since 2000. A previous low of 58 in the civilian category was record in 2021. In the SF category, the previous low of 44 was recorded in 2020. A previous low of 87 in the _Naxalite_ category was recorded in 2004. Civilian and _Naxalite_ fatalities have also been on a continuous decline since 2019. SF fatalities have also declined through this period, barring 2021 (51 fatalities) when there was a spike compared to 2020 (44 fatalities). Other parameters of violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation relating to LWE activities across the country. The number of overall LWE-linked terrorist incidents fell from 676 in 2021 to 602 in 2022. In particular, incidents of killing came down from 124 in 2021 to 107 in 2022. Seven of the 107 overall incidents of killing were major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in 2022. In 2021, the number of major incidents was 15. Resultant fatalities from major incidents declined from 114 (seven civilians, 30 SF personnel, and 77 _Naxalites_) in 2021 to 22 (one civilian, three SF personnel, and 18 _Naxalites_) in 2022. In 2023, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents was 169, of which 32 were incidents of killing. Two major incidents have already been recorded in 2023. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2022, at 1:4.46, the best since 2000, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2021, the ratio was at 1:2.5. The ratio has remined in favour of the SFs since 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.61). In the current year, the kill ratio is in favour of the SFs at 1:1.11, so far (data till April 6, 2023). SFs arrested 395 _Naxalites_ in 2022, in addition to 409 in 2021, according to partial data compiled by SATP. In the current year, as on April 6, 2023, 122 arrests had been recorded. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, a total of 15,993 has been recorded. The mounting pressure on _Naxalites_ has yielded a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP, at least 2,855 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2022, in addition to 533 in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of surrenders was 97. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 16,581 LWEs have surrendered. Through 2022, SFs recovered arms from the Maoists in 190 incidents, in addition to 268 such incidents of recovery in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of such incidents are 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,694 incidents of arms recovery are documented. An analysis of over-ground and underground Maoist activities in the country’s LWE-affected areas also suggests a diminishing influence. According to SATP, in 2022, Maoist activities were reported from 10 States in comparison to 11 States in 2021. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 10 affected States have a total of 310 Districts, of which 58 recorded a Maoist presence. Of these 58, three districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 27 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 28 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2021, of 79 affected districts, one district fell in the ‘extremely-affected’ category, four in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 46 were ‘marginally affected’. Indeed, on March 28, 2023, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, in a written reply to a question in the _Lok Sabha_ (Lower House of the Indian Parliament), announced that the number of districts most affected by LWE had reduced from 35 in 2017 to 30 in April 2018, and then to 25 in July **[2021](https://pqals.nic.in/annex/1711/AU4464.pdf)**. Further, on March 28, 2023, the Government stated that the “geographical spread of violence has significantly reduced and only 176 Police Stations of 45 districts reported LWE violence in 2022, as compared to a high of 465 Police Stations of 96 districts in 2010”. Conspicuously, all major LWE-affected states across the country — **[Andhra Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-30)**, **[Bihar](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-31#assessment2)**, **[Chhattisgarh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-29#assessment2)**, **[Jharkhand](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-33#assessment2)**, **[Kerala](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-39#assessment2)**, **[Madhya Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-40#assessment2)**, **[Maharashtra](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-38#assessment2)**, **[Odisha](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-34#assessment2)**, and **[Telangana](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-37)** have witnessed an overall improvement in the security situation. Nevertheless, the Maoist challenge persists. OThe Perilous **[Bastar Division](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-22#assessment2)**, the safe haven of the residual Maoist problem not only in Chhattisgarh but across the entire LWE-affected region, comprising seven densely forested districts - Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur and Sukma - sprawling across 40,000 square kilometers, in the southernmost region of the state, is the location of the last Maoist bastions. On November 7, 2022, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar Range, Sundarraj P., asserting that the SFs were committed to wiping out the Maoist threat, nevertheless accepted, | | | --- | | In Bastar Range, though civilian killings have reduced to a great extent, from 279 in the year 2006, to 29 in 2022, it is still an area of major concern in left-wing extremist affected areas. | Indeed, on March 28, 2023, the Maoists abducted and killed two villagers, in Narayanpur and Sukma Districts, branding them as ‘Police informers’ (incidents mentioned above). Moreover, the early data for 2023 suggests that SF dominance on the ground, purely in terms of the kill ratio, has weakened during the first three months of 2023, as compared to the whole of 2022 and earlier. Not surprisingly, civilian insecurity has escalated. Disturbingly, more than a few deficits in the fighting forces remained noticeable in some of the worst Maoist-afflicted States, according to the _Bureau of Police Research & Development_ (BPR&D) data. BPR&D disclosed, as on January 1, 2021, that there were at least 28 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst affected State, that had no telephone. In Jharkhand, 47 had no vehicle, 211 had no telephone, and 31 had no wireless/mobile connectivity. In Andhra Pradesh, 65 Police Stations had no vehicle, and 34 had no wireless/mobile connectivity; and in Odisha, four had no vehicle, and three had no telephone. Moreover, large vacancies persist in the State Police Forces. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2021, against the sanctioned strength of 1,109,260 there were a total of 838,481 policemen in position in 10 LWE-affected States, leaving a vacancy of 270,779, i.e., 24.41 per cent. At the national level, deficits against sanctioned strength were 20.34 per cent, almost the same as the shortage in the Maoist affected States. The police-population ratio (policemen per hundred thousand population) of these 12 States had increased from an average of 138.63 in 2018 to 149.42 in 2019. Meanwhile, the all-India police-population ratio had increased from 150.80 in 2018 to 158.22 in 2019, significantly higher than the levels in the LWE affected States. Importantly, existing police-population ratios in these 12 states remained significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 183.97. At the national level, the existing levels were also significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 198.65 per 100,000. Moreover, the number of vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) of these 12 States was 595 (22.44 per cent), as against 948 (19.97 per cent) at the national level, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. These critical deficiencies in the enforcement apparatuses need urgent attention if the gains against the Maoists are to be consolidated further. The Maoists are down, but yet not out. The overall declining trend in Maoist violence and activity across the country needs to be contained with further security interventions with a sense of urgency, as the Maoists have shown incredible capacities for resurrection in the past, and retain substantial operational and overground capabilities in significant areas of their erstwhile regions of dominance. The SFs will have to overcome prevailing operational and capacity deficits, to prevent any rebel resurgence. | [Assessments Year

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with “unspecified casualties” on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi’s China and Modi’s India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China’s ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China’s abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India’s protest in denying Beijing’s claims as “exaggerated and untenable” is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi’s “clarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat”_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India’s active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China’s nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India’s nuclear strike range_** **_(right) – estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India’s national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China’s “containment of India,” the modernization of the PLA and its “growing assertiveness on the border”, and recommended a shift of India’s national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China’s unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or “string of pearls” that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India’s security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India’s peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China’s energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China’s power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China’s “Malacca dilemma,” by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing’s interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of “the quad”, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing’s ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India’s nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India’s boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India’s dismay. When BRI’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India’s doctrine of “strategic autonomy”. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek “equivalence” with the great powers — China, Russia, US — in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi’s party and support the base’s nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem “techno-nationalism”.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India’s dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India’s military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China’s relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. Commensurate to China’s 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a “peaceful rise” of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world’s longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India’s options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India’s strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India’s preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India’s “Neighborhood First” policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi’s ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal’s stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the “Asian Century” may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India’s geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide “chicken’s neck” connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China’s favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi’s strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India’s advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ”partners” with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh’s deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China’s border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its “like-minded partners” in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India’s diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war – for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India’s irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China’s assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-à-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, “wolf-warrior diplomacy”, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India – the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its “NORMS — New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System” approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India’s quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact – an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China – to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia – India’s soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter’s unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese “iron brother”, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China’s increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India’s disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled.

It continues to be so.”_– Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.\\[i\\] _From Ideology To Warfare_ The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. _Resurgence_ Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. ### A New Strategy _“We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.”_-Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. _Overruns_ On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • **Used improvised explosive devices.** Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • **Assassinated officials.** In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • **Destroyed police infrastructure.** Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj _Systems Disruption_ At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? ### The Deviant Economic Engine _“The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.”_-Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. _The Revolutionary Tax_ In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. _A Revolutionary Tax Economy_ To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • **Mining.** Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • **Narcotics.** India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • **Informal tolls.** Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. ### A Strategic Half-Life _“It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they_ _look to the Naxals for justice.”_–Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future. _Sources:_ i Mahendra Kumawat, “Naxal Movement Has Shown Tremendous Grit,” Rediff News, April 9, 2010. ii Waquar Ahmed, Amitabh Kundu, and Richard Peet, India’s New Economic Policy: A Critical Analysis (New York: Routledge, 2011). iii Bibhudatta Pradhan and Santosh Kumar, “Pillai to End Maoist Grip on $80 Billion Investments,” Bloomberg Businessweek, September 17, 2010. iv Government of India, “Fact Sheet On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),” Ministry of Commerce and Industry, February 11, 2011, http://dipp.nic.in/fdi\\_statistics/india\\_FDI\\_February2011.pdf (accessed March 23, 2011). v Rahul Nilakantan and Saurabh Singhal, “The Economic Costs Of Naxalite Violence and the Economic Benefits of a Unique Robust Security Response,” 2010. http://www.aae.wisc.edu/mwiedc/papers/2011/Singhal\\_Saurabh.pdf (accessed April 3, 2011). vi “Chhattisgarh’s Entire Forest Area A Minefield?,” Times of India, May 10, 2010. vii Manoj Prasad, “Former Jharkhand CM Marandi on Their Hitlist, Naxals Kill Son, 17 More,” Indian Express, October 28, 2007. viii Press Trust of India, “Maoists Storm Jehanabad Jail,” Rediff News, November 14, 2005. ix Sudheer Pal Singh, “Illegal Mining May Impede Divestment in Coal India,” Business Standard, August 21, 2010. x Government of India, “Loss of Coal Production in Naxalite Areas,” Press Information Bureau, August 4, 2010, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=64116 (accessed January 4, 2011). xi “Chronology of Naxal Attacks on Trains,” India Today, May 28, 2010. xii Law Kumar Mishra, “Maoists Blow Up Track on Gaya-Dhanbad Section, Rail Traffic Disrupted,” Times of India, September 13, 2010. xiii “Naxal Attacks Doubled in 2009, Rlys Lost Rs 500cr: Mamata,” Times of India, April 23, 2010. xiv Manoj Prasad, “Naxal Attacks, Escalated Cost Derail Jharkhand Railway Projects,” India Express, April 12, 2010. xv Ishita Ayan Dutt, “Naxal Hits to Pull NMDC Net Down by Rs 1,000 cr,” Business Standard, April 20, 2010. xvi “NMDC to Lay 12 mt Pipeline on Highways to Avoid Naxal Attacks,” The Financial Express, July 20, 2010. xvii “Naxals Obstruct Road Works,” The Hindu, May 9, 2011. xviii Dutt. xix Sandeep Joshi, “550 More Mobile Towers to Boost Fight Against Naxalites,” The Hindu, June 30, 2010. xx “World Bank Approves $1.5 billion for India’s Rural Roads Scheme,” Press Trust of India, December 22, 2010. xxi Prassana Mohanty, “Maoists’ Financing – The Blood Flows as Long as the Cash Flows,” Governance Now, April 7, 2010. xxii Mohanty xxiii Sujeet Kumar, “Maoists extort Rs 300 Crore Annually in Chhattisgarh,” The Economic Times, July 5, 2009. xxiv Bharti Jain, “Rs 150 Crore: Maoists Extortion Amount From Chhattisgarh SSIs,” The EconomicTimes, April 10, 2010. xxv Ajit Kumar Singh and Sachin Bansidhar Diwan, “Red Money,” Outlook India, April 5, 2010. xxvi Ministry of Home Affairs, 2010-2011 Annual Report (Delhi: Government of India, 2011). xxvii Shaikh Azizur Rahman, “India’s Illegal Coal Mines Turn Into Death Pits,” The WashingtonTimes, November 24, 2006. xxviii Prasoon Majumdar, “Our Own Banana Republics!” Indian Institute of Planning andManagement, August 26, 2010, http://prasoonmajumdar.blogspot.com/2010/08/our-own-banana- republics.html (accessed April 29, 2011). xxix United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, “India is a Major Drug Hub: US,” September, 2007, http://www.unodc.org/india/en/rajiv\\_quoted\\_et.html (accessed February 25, 2011).

It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. Picture source: Depositphotos. _Prospects & Perspectives No. 28_ **The Shadow War: How the Pahalgam Terror Attack Redefined India-China-Pakistan Equation** By _Jagannath Panda_ The Pahalgam [terror attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl) of April 2025, executed by the Pakistan-backed group [The Resistance Front](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473) (TRF), was not merely another episode in the long-running saga of India-Pakistan hostility. It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. By and large, India’s reaction was strong, swift, and assertive beyond the border against the terrorist outfits harbored in Pakistan. The launch of [Operation Sindoor](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473), a precise military response targeting terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC), marked a defining evolution in India’s deterrence doctrine, pointing to a zero-tolerance strategy against terrorism. More than a tactical strike, it was a message — India will respond with resolve, not restraint, when its civilians are attacked. The operation drew clear parallels with the Balakot airstrikes of 2019, yet the context had shifted. The regional climate in 2025 is far more combustible, with trilateral tensions simmering in the Himalayas. The Pahalgam incident has exposed deep-seated fractures in the regional power matrix. China’s strategic posture in the aftermath — marked by conspicuous silence, selective language, and diplomatic hedging — underscores a growing contradiction between its self-styled image as a responsible global power and its operational behavior in South Asia. By refusing to acknowledge the terrorist dimension of such attacks or to pressure its close partner, Pakistan, Beijing reveals a troubling unwillingness to act as a genuine stabilizing force in the region. The contradictions in its stand are only growing and becoming more transparent to the world by the day. Is China truly committed to regional peace and stability, or is it bound by time-worn strategic alignments that prioritize geopolitical advantage over normative responsibility? Can a power that positions itself as an architect of global order afford to undermine its credibility by shielding a state associated with cross-border terrorism? What should be India’s strategic response to this shadow war? **Beijing’s Balancing Act: Neutrality or Strategic Collusion?** Following India’s retaliation, the world watched closely for diplomatic fallout. China’s response was a masterclass in studied ambiguity. Beijing termed India’s military action “ [regrettable](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202505/t20250507_11616523.html)” while conspicuously omitting any condemnation of the terror attack itself. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made [no mention](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/lxjzh/202505/t20250509_11618305.html) of the victims in Pahalgam, nor TRF’s Pakistani connections. Instead, Beijing’s focus remained firmly on urging “restraint” and “dialogue,” echoing a playbook that has often shielded Islamabad from international censure. This is not entirely a new behavior on the part of the Chinese leadership. Beijing has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the UN Security Council to [block designations of known terrorists](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slams-china-at-un-for-blocking-move-to-designate-2611-accused-sajid-mir-as-global-terrorist/article66993043.ece) based in Pakistan, including Sajid Mir, a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander involved in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008. This pattern of diplomatic protection underscores China’s strategic calculus: Pakistan is more than an ally — it is a linchpin in Beijing’s South Asia strategy and a buffer against Indian regional ascendency. What makes China’s stance especially problematic is its persistent refusal to differentiate between India’s counterterrorism actions and aggressive behavior. Chinese state media and official discourse frequently conflate Indian responses along the LoC with assertive conduct along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), crafting a narrative in which India is portrayed as a regional aggressor. This distortion allows Beijing to simultaneously align with Pakistan’s security outlook while maintaining a superficial neutrality. Moreover, China’s behavior mirrors its broader geopolitical approach: internal threats such as “Uyghur separatism” are met with uncompromising state violence, while external threats that affect neighbors like India are compartmentalized or ignored. The selective outrage is a window into Beijing’s dual standards on terrorism and state sovereignty. **Proxy Wars and Silent Partners: Redrawing the Diplomatic Map** Beyond the rhetoric, Beijing’s alignment with Pakistan is rooted in hard interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the crown jewel of Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This infrastructure project is not just about roads and pipelines — it’s about strategic depth. Any Indian challenge to the territorial status quo threatens both Pakistan’s and China’s investments, thereby sealing the logic of Beijing’s indirect complicity. This complicity extends into the diplomatic arena. In multilateral forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China has consistently [blocked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/human-rights-must-be-respected-india-after-skipping-xinjiang-vote/articleshow/94713915.cms) Indian attempts to highlight Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism. Instead, China promotes counterterrorism frameworks that align neatly with its own domestic narratives, especially those concerning Xinjiang, while conveniently avoiding issues that implicate Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues its [strategic silence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/22/asia/imran-khan-xinjiang-axios-intl-hnk) on China’s repression of Uyghur Muslims, despite its self-styled image as a champion of the Islamic world. This tacit exchange of blind spots — on terrorism and human rights — has become the bedrock of the Sino-Pakistani axis. And India, despite walking a tightrope on sensitive Chinese issues like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, has received no reciprocation in the form of diplomatic neutrality or support. The geopolitical geometry is clear: while India and Pakistan battle over borders and ideology, China plays the dual role of facilitator and firewall for Islamabad. Whether in backchannel diplomacy or in global institutions, China consistently acts to dilute pressure on Pakistan, reinforcing a strategic triangle that disadvantages New Delhi at every turn. Beijing’s deliberate omission of Pakistani provocations and cross-border violence in its Operation Sindoor response press briefings suggests a calculated strategic posture. This silence reflects China’s continued alignment with Pakistan, indicating that broader geopolitical considerations outweigh any immediate concerns about regional instability. By not publicly addressing Islamabad’s role, China signals its intent to preserve and prioritize its long-standing strategic partnership with Pakistan. **A Call for India’s Strategic Realignment** In this increasingly tangled web of interests, India must reassess its China doctrine. The idea of Beijing as a potential stabilizer in South Asia has little basis in reality. Instead, China has shown a consistent willingness to prioritize its strategic partnerships and investments over regional peace or normative alignment against terrorism. One avenue for India is to adopt a strategy of normative reciprocity. If China insists on referring to Jammu and Kashmir as a “disputed territory,” India could begin more openly addressing Chinese sensitive issues, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and potentially even Taiwan, revisiting its “One China” policy. Until now, India has largely upheld a principle of “mutual sensitivity” regarding core sovereignty concerns. While China has been increasingly assertive in internationalizing the Kashmir issue — whether through UN Security Council interventions, statements aligning with Pakistan, or selective cartographic provocations — India has avoided reciprocal commentary on China’s sensitive regions. This asymmetric restraint has allowed China to shape narratives unchallenged, while denying India the same deference on issues central to its national unity. Engaging Taiwan more openly — especially on trade, technology, and democratic solidarity — aligns India with other democracies like the U.S., Japan, and parts of Europe that have gradually normalized unofficial ties. Strengthening ties with Taiwan also offers India access to high-end manufacturing, especially in semiconductors, where Taiwan’s TSMC dominates global supply chains, critical for India’s tech and defense sectors. A closer India-Taiwan dynamic could be used as part of a broader Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance Chinese assertiveness in the region, especially when coupled with defense dialogues like the Quad. Explicit moves on Taiwan would likely provoke strong diplomatic and possibly economic retaliation from Beijing. This could take the form of border pressure along the LAC, trade restrictions, or cyber disruptions. Any move on Taiwan would have more impact if coordinated with partners like the U.S., Japan, or Australia. A unilateral shift may yield limited strategic gain while exposing India to disproportionate costs. It is therefore imperative that India must continue to invest more robustly in multilateral and minilateral coalitions that exclude or counterbalance China, such as the Quad, the India-Japan-Australia trilateral, and enhanced EU engagements. India’s aspiration to be recognized as a major international power, including in the “Global South,” depends not solely on its material capabilities but also on its normative influence, particularly in shaping global discourses on terrorism. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, New Delhi may need to recalibrate its approach by intensifying collaboration with global norm entrepreneurs, including middle powers across Europe and Asia, as well as transnational civil society and multilateral institutions. Moreover, India’s leadership roles in forums such as the G20 and BRICS present strategic platforms through which it can reframe regional security narratives and assert its vision for counterterrorism norms. Domestically, India must prepare for the long haul. The possibility of a coordinated two-front scenario — with Pakistan engaging in asymmetric warfare through proxy actors and irregular tactics and China providing strategic and diplomatic cover — is no longer hypothetical. Preparing for this evolving threat environment requires India to adopt a comprehensive and long-term security posture, encompassing military modernization, institutional resilience, and societal preparedness. Enhancing border infrastructure, upgrading intelligence and surveillance capabilities, and fortifying strategic deterrence must be non-negotiables in India’s defense roadmap. Sustaining a prolonged state of readiness requires a resilient defense-industrial base, robust supply chains, and financial planning. India must continue reforms to reduce dependence on foreign arms imports, incentivize indigenous R&D, and create strategic reserves for critical materials. Further, building robust logistical networks, especially in border states and high-altitude regions, will improve troop mobility and sustain long-term deployments. Civil-military synergy in infrastructure projects such as roads, airfields, and telecommunications along both western and eastern frontiers is essential. The shifting threat landscape demands that India move beyond reactive postures. Both Pakistan and China are adept at leveraging information warfare and disinformation to influence public opinion and sow discord. India must invest in counter-disinformation capacities, strategic communication, and public awareness campaigns to build regional and societal resilience against foreign psychological operations, where Taiwan could emerge as a stronger partner. New Delhi must significantly enhance its capabilities in narrative warfare — a strategic effort to shape perceptions, control the discourse, and influence international opinion. This involves not only countering adversarial narratives but also proactively framing its own story in a manner that resonates with global audiences. India’s case against Pakistan-based terrorism, as well as China’s tacit support through diplomatic silence or selective framing, must be articulated with clarity, credibility, and moral authority. To be effective, this narrative must be disseminated across multiple global platforms — from the United Nations and international media to think tanks, academic forums, and digital diplomacy channels — to expose the regional destabilizing roles of both Pakistan and China, and to align international sentiment with India’s security concerns and normative positions. The decision to send [delegations](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seven-all-party-delegations-to-take-indias-message-against-terrorism-to-key-partner-nations-government/article69586448.ece) to 32 nations is a strong first step. Publishing credible evidence, such as satellite imagery, financial trail disclosures, or intercepted communications, can further strengthen the factual basis of India’s narrative and pre-empt counterclaims. **Conclusion: Pahalgam as a Turning Point** The Pahalgam terrorist attack will be remembered not just for its human toll, but for what it revealed about the shifting tectonics of regional power complexities. It was a moment of clarity: India is not just facing a belligerent neighbor in Pakistan, but also contending with a cunning and double-standard power in China that is willing to obscure terrorism behind the veil of strategic self-interest. Increasingly, China’s actions — or calculated inactions — are rendering its strategic contradictions more visible to the international community, challenging the coherence of its South Asia policy and weakening its claim to impartiality in regional conflict resolution. The path ahead for India requires more than conventional military readiness; it calls for a fundamental reassessment of the strategic assumptions underpinning India's approach to China, particularly regarding Beijing’s role in shaping, enabling, or deferring regional crises. New Delhi’s challenge is two-fold. It must deter asymmetric threats from across the border, and it must decode and counteract the quieter, more insidious enablers of that threat. That means not just stronger borders, but sharper diplomacy. Not just better arms, but better arguments. Narrative warfare, if conducted strategically, allows India not just to defend its position but to shape the global agenda on terrorism and regional order, reinforcing its claim to normative leadership as a rising power. Pahalgam may have been a tragedy for India, but it is also an inflection point. A new foreign policy realism must follow. Because in this geopolitical theatre, the shadows are as dangerous as the swords.

India has seen a sharp rise in cyberattacks over the last few years, which has turned data protection into a top security concern. According to **CERT-IN,** between **2021 and mid-2025,** India recorded more than **2.2 million** cybersecurity incidents, averaging more than **3,000 attacks per day,** with financial services, healthcare, telecom, and government platforms among the hardest hit. Hackers focused on cloud misconfigurations, unpatched servers, and weak internal access controls. The list below tracks **25 major cyberattacks in India** from 2021 to 2025, showing how they happened and what strategies can be used to prevent similar breaches. ## **1\\. Angel One AWS resource breach/potential data leakage, February 2025** Angel One, India's largest broking firm, was recently hacked. Hackers gained access to an unsecured AWS storage bucket linked to it, exposing the sensitive data of **7.9 million** users, such as trading details, email addresses, and customer IDs. Cloud management made sensitive data visible on public servers. To avoid such scams, similar companies must audit all cloud buckets, enable encryption, and always restrict public access through IAM (Identity and Access Management) rules. ## **2\\. AI-generated Phishing and Infostealer Surge, 2025** In 2025, several Indian banks and fintech platforms reported a rise in AI-generated phishing scams. Attackers used a realistic, AI-written email to fool users into giving away credentials. Thousands have already fallen victim to these smarter phishing campaigns by unknowingly entering their bank credentials, leading to financial losses and identity theft. Attackers also used voice cloning and deepfake technology to impersonate officials, which makes the deception look more convincing. One must consider the fact that constant user training, spam filters, and AI-based email scanning tools block most phishing messages before they reach inboxes. ## **3\\. Aditya Birla Capital Digital (ABCD) App Hack, 2025** Hackers targeted a weakness in the ABCD mobile app API, revealing customers' loan and PAN details. The attackers targeted unprotected endpoints, which allows data scraping. API vulnerabilities remain a growing concern for finance apps. However, routine code audits with secure token validation and regular app updates can stop such data exposure. ## **4\\. Star Health Threats, May 2025** Star Health, one of India's largest health insurers, experienced a major data breach that affected 31 million policyholders; much of the core information, including medical records, insurance details, and personal information, was breached and even published on the dark web. This breach shows how healthcare data can be exploited for identity theft. Encrypting health records, segmenting sensitive systems, and ensuring continuous monitoring can reduce such risks. ## **5\\. Delhi Hospitals Ransomware Attack, June 2025** Delhi's **Sant Parmanand** and **NKS Super Speciality** hospitals were targeted by ransomware that locked almost all patient and billing data. Over **60,000 records** were affected by this attack. The attack used phishing emails to deliver ransomware payloads. The malware spread quickly through unprotected hospital networks. Hospitals should isolate administrative and patient data systems, train staff to identify suspicious emails, and maintain offline data backups. ## **6\\. Kolkata Police Cyber Crime Wing Data Breach, August 2025** Weak internal passwords and a lack of access control allowed hackers to access internal police systems, where investigation details from the Cyber Wing in Kolkata were leaked. This breach exposed officer credentials and case data. The attack raised alarms about insider threats and the need for stronger law enforcement cybersecurity. Police and law enforcement agencies should adopt role-based access control, enforce password rotations, and enable two-factor authentication for internal systems. ## **7\\. Multiple Cyberattacks on Indian Governments, 2024.** Multiple state e-governance portals were hacked in 2024, leaking citizen Aadhaar and bank details. At least **2.5 million** records were compromised across several platforms. Many portals lacked basic HTTPS encryption, which allowed attackers to exploit outdated plugins and weak admin passwords. That's why regular CMS updates, secure admin logins, and government-wide cybersecurity policies are vital for protection. Every e-governance platform must undergo quarterly vulnerability assessments and follow a national cybersecurity standard to protect public data. ## **8\\. Polycab Ransomware Attack, March 2024** Polycab India, a top cable manufacturer, suffered a ransomware attack, causing a **Rs 20 crore** operational loss. The breach started from an infected employee workstation and ended with hackers encrypting internal files and demanding high payments. The attack also affected the supplier and distributor network, exposing the ripple effect of industrial cyber incidents. ## **9\\. Indian Energy Sector Attack, 2024** This breach shows the exposure of operational technology systems, where hackers tried to infiltrate India's power grid through malware-infected email attachments sent to energy employees. The attack aimed to disrupt the electricity supply but was quickly contained. **Tip:** Separating IT and OT networks and constantly monitoring power infrastructure can prevent major outages like this. Moreover, conducting red team simulations and regular cybersecurity drills helps reduce the chance of large-scale blackouts. ## **10\\. BSNL Data Breach, May 2024** Personal details of **2.9 million** broadband subscribers were leaked from a BSNL database due to old, unpatched systems. Leaked data included phone numbers and service details. The breach came from a neglected internal server. The outdated system, left without proper monitoring, became an easy entry point. Updating infrastructure and restricting admin access can prevent similar service providers. **Read Also: [Top 30 Best-Known Cybersecurity Case Studies 2025](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-best-known-cybersecurity-case-studies)** ## **11\\. UP Marriage Assistance Scheme Leak, 2024** The Uttar Pradesh Marriage Assistance Scheme is a welfare initiative aimed at helping low-income families. Data from the welfare portal of Uttar Pradesh leaked, including Aadhaar, bank details, and contact information, affecting **200,000** applicants. The data was found indexed on search engines, shockingly. The root cause was traced to poor web server configuration and missing access restrictions. A web firewall and regular penetration testing could have prevented this from happening. ## **12\\. Airtel India Customer Database Leak (375 Million Users), June 2024** Hackers claimed to sell a database of **375 million** users, which would be nearly **25%** of India's population. Airtel denied the break, but the data was widely shared online. The leak included Aadhaar numbers and personal details. Even if false, it revealed risks from third-party data handling. Telecom companies must run vendor audits and apply zero-trust security across all databases, anonymising customer data wherever possible to reduce exposure if leaks occur. ## **13\\. WazirX Hack, July 2024** Crypto firms must use cold wallets for storage and conduct third-party code audits before deploying smart contracts. WazirX, a crypto exchange, was targeted by hackers who were exploiting blockchain smart contract vulnerabilities. Roughly **$230 million** worth of assets were at risk. This breach clearly highlights that public blockchain code, if left unaudited, can create hidden backdoors. ## **14\\. boAt India Data Breach, 2023** Encrypting user data and applying hashed passwords are key to securing e-commerce databases. In 2023, an unsecured server was recently exposed, exposing **7.5 million** customer records, including names and contact information. The leak spread on Telegram and hacking forums. Weak password protection made recovery even harder. Many users later reported spam calls and targeted ads due to leaked data. ## **15\\. Telangana Police's Hawk Eye App Data Breach, 2023** Hackers accessed the Hawk Eye mobile app, revealing user profiles and feedback reports. The app, meant for citizen safety, accidentally exposed personal data through a misconfigured API. Public-facing government apps should use token-based access, secure API gateways and regular security reviews before each software update. **Read Also: [Top 50 Cyber Security Projects for Final Year Students (2025 Edition)](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-25-cyber-security-projects-for-final-year-students)** ## **16\\. Hyundai Motor India Data Leak, 2023** Thousands of car owners whose contact and vehicle details were stolen were found on the dark web. The source of the breach was traced to a third-party vendor responsible for managing the dealer's database. Weak vendor access controls and outdated security measures worsened the system, risking identity misuse because the data appeared on dark web forums for sale. ## **17\\. SPARSH Data Breach, 2023** The Ministry of Defence's SPARSH portal suffered a breach, which exposed pensioner IDs and bank details. Hackers used credential stuffing techniques on weak passwords. This breach raised national security concerns as the portal handled sensitive military data. Multi-factor authentication, stronger password policies, and regular login behaviour analysis can stop similar attacks. ## **18\\. Sun Pharma Cyber Attack, 2023** Pharmaceutical giant Sun Pharma's ransomware disrupted its internal operations and supply chain, causing **Rs. 30 crore** in losses. Hackers entered through a phishing email and encrypted internal servers. Companies should train employees to identify phishing attempts, install anti-ransomware software, and maintain offline data backups for rapid recovery. ## **19\\. BharatPe Hacked: August 2022** Phishing emails led to a breach of employees' inboxes, leaking internal documents and financial reports. The attackers used social engineering to mimic trusted contacts, tricking employees into sharing login credentials. While no customer data was stolen, the breach hurt investor confidence. Using email MFA, spam filters, and awareness campaigns can block future phishing attempts. ## **20\\. Cyberattack on AIIMS: December 2022** India's top hospital, AIIMS, suffered a ransomware attack that took **3 million** patient records. The servers remained slow for approximately two weeks, which caused major disruption. **Read Also: [The Rise of Agentic AI in Cyber Warfare: Implications for Global Security](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/the-rise-of-agentic-ai-in-cyber-warfare-implications-for-global-security)** ## **21\\. CloudSEK Data Breach: December 2022** In 2022, hackers stole internal data from the cybersecurity firm CloudSEK and exposed API keys on **GitHub.** The breach revealed how even security companies can be vulnerable. Never use credentials in code repositories, and rotate all access tokens regularly. ## **22\\. Swachhta Platform Hacked, September 2022** Hackers breached India's Swachh Bharat (Clean India) platform, a government site that collected public sanitation feedback and cleanliness reports. The attackers took advantage of outdated CMS plugins and weak credentials, allowing them to deface the homepage and delete parts of the citizen feedback database. ## **23\\. Zivame Data Breach, 2022** In 2022, Indian lingerie retailer Zivame experienced an excessive data breach exposing personal and transactional information of nearly **1.5 million** customers. The data included names, phone numbers, email addresses and partially masked payment records. Investigators traced the cause to an unsecured database server left open to the public without password protection. The leaked dataset appeared later on dark web forums for sale. ## **24\\. Air India / SITA Passenger Data Breach, 2021** Recently, in 2021, a global cyberattack on SITA, the IT provider for various airlines, exposed personal data of over **4.5 million** Air India passengers, which included passport details, ticket numbers, birth dates, and contact information. The breach was traced to unauthorised access in SITA's passenger service system, which connected multiple airlines worldwide, compromising long-term passenger privacy. That's why airlines and travel companies must vet all external vendors for compliance with strict cybersecurity standards, enforce encryption for shared databases and deploy continuous threat detection across connected systems. ## **25\\. Domino's India Customer Data Leak, 2021** Hackers exposed nearly **180 million** customer order details, including their names, phone numbers and even GPS coordinates. Attackers used an unsecured server within the company's order-tracking infrastructure, and later they published the full dataset on the dark web. The exposed location information was essentially alarming, as it could reveal customers' routines and residential details. Companies handling location-based services should encrypt all customer data, mask stored addresses and set strict retention periods for order records. **Read Also: [Zero Trust Security: The Future of Cyber Defense](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/zero-trust-security-the-future-of-cyber-defense)** ## **In the End** India's cybersecurity reflects both rapid progress and rising exposure. Attackers have now shifted to multi-stage ransomware, insider misuse, and AI-generated phishing. Organisations that invested early in zero-trust controls, employee awareness programmes, and regular threat monitoring have contained incidents faster and have limited damage. Every sector, private or public, must treat cybersecurity as an **operational priority** rather than a compliance task tied to reputation, customer trust, and business continuity. ## **Frequently Asked Questions** ### **Which sector faces the most cyber threats in India?** The financial, healthcare, telecom and e-commerce sectors top the list due to their high data value. Banking APIs, digital payment apps, and hospital systems are common ransomware and credential theft targets. ### **What are the main reasons behind the rise in cyberattacks in India?** The main reasons are rapid digitisation, weak password habits, over-reliance on cloud storage without proper encryption, and phishing campaigns using AI-written messages. ### **How can individuals protect themselves from data leaks in India?** Use unique passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, avoid public Wi-Fi for banking, and never click unknown links in SMS or WhatsApp messages.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

    "full_text": "# India's Geographic Vulnerability to Climate Change Industry Updates 17 mins September 25, 2024 Manasvi Patel ## **World Environmental Health Day 2024** World Environmental Health Day 2024 focuses on the theme \"Environmental Health: Creating Resilient Communities through Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation.\" This theme underscores the critical need to enhance community resilience in the face of climate-related disasters, which have become increasingly frequent and severe due to global warming. By emphasizing disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation, this year's theme calls for integrated approaches that not only protect public health but also ensure sustainable development. India's unique geography and climate make it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. With 27 out of 29 states and 7 union territories susceptible to natural hazards like floods, cyclones, droughts, and earthquakes, the country faces an uphill battle against the devastating impacts of climate change. As World Environmental Health Day 2024 approaches, it's crucial for India to take bold steps to enhance community resilience and protect its vulnerable populations. ### Geographical Factors Contributing to Disaster Risk India's geographical factors significantly contribute to its disaster risk profile, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The combination of its diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors creates a complex landscape of [vulnerabilities](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf): - [**Earthquakes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.7059oimyb6r3): Approximately 58.6% of India's landmass is susceptible to earthquakes, with the country situated in a seismically active zone due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. - [**Coastal Vulnerability**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.sipw79xc52s): India's coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, exposes it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. - [**Floods**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.af8gn4f1799i) and [**droughts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.xdkivgfc02df): about 40 million hectares (around 12% of the land) are prone to floods and river erosion, while 68% of cultivable land is vulnerable to droughts. - [**Landslides**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.kmor8crhvnf7) and avalanches: The hilly regions are also at risk from landslides and avalanches, further compounding the disaster risk faced by various communities across the nation. #### Seismic Activity India is situated at the convergence of several tectonic plates, making it prime for earthquakes. ~58% of the country’s landmass is classified as being at risk for earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity. This seismic vulnerability is particularly pronounced in regions such as the Himalayan belt, which experiences tremors due to ongoing tectonic activity. ##### The Gujarat (Bhuj) Earthquake (2001) For instance, the [2001 Bhuj earthquake](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bhuj-earthquake-of-2001), which registered a magnitude of 7.7, resulted in over 20,000 deaths and injured more than 150,000 others. The earthquake affected approximately 28 million people, destroyed more than 400,000 buildings, with the telecom building collapsing, Bhuj was isolated from the rest of the state; the most seriously affected was the Kandla port (the busiest port in India) which caters to handling crucial imports of petroleum products, crude oil and chemicals and export of agricultural commodities, with about five of the 10 jetties damaged. Over 10,000 small and medium industrial units had to stop production due to damage to plants, factories, and machinery. The Indian State Department [estimates](https://www.adrc.asia/publications/recovery_reports/Gujarat.pdf) that the earthquake affected, directly or indirectly, 15.9 million people out of 37.8 million. The government estimated the direct economic loss at $1.3 billion, while estimates indicate this could be as high as $5 billion. Following the earthquake, emergency relief operations were launched by both government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs): - [ActionAid India](https://www.actionaidindia.org/emergency/gujarat-earthquake-2001/) mobilized local community-based organizations to provide immediate assistance in the most affected areas, by establishing temporary shelters, distributed food and medical supplies, and set up psycho-social counseling services for survivors. - The government initiated a [comprehensive rehabilitation plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm) that included new building codesto ensure that the structures were designed to be earthquake-resistant; and infrastructure redevelopment of roads, schools, hospitals, and utilities was prioritized. - Emphasizing on community participation in planning and implementing disaster management strategies, village-level committees were formed to enhance local capacity for disaster response. - A [State Disaster Management Plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm#:~:text=Gujarat%20State%20Disaster%20Management%20Authority%20(GSDMA)%2C%20which%20would%20implement%20the%20reconstruction%20and%20rehabilitation%2C%20with%20support%20from%20various%20other%20agencies%20in%20the%20quake%2Dhit%20area.) was created that integrated lessons learned from the earthquake, and focused on risk assessment, early warning systems, and community-based disaster management practices aimed at reducing vulnerability to future seismic events. The resilience-building activities undertaken after the Gujarat earthquake reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate relief with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. These efforts underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in seismically active regions like India #### Coastal Vulnerability India's long coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, makes it highly vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis, [exposing](https://irade.org/Sustainable%20and%20Disaster%20Resilient%20Urban%20DevelopmentFinal%20.pdf) it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. This vulnerability is particularly pronounced in states like Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, which have borne the brunt of devastating cyclones in recent years. ###### Cyclone Fani (2019) Cyclone Fani, which made landfall in Odisha on May 3, 2019, serves as a prime example of the destruction that coastal areas face. The [extremely severe](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/cyclone-fani-damage-loss-and-needs-assessment) cyclonic storm caused extensive damage across 14 districts in Odisha, [affecting](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2019-000041-ind) at least 10 million people in the North-eastern Sates of India. Despite the early evacuation of a million people, the cyclone has severely affected the lives and livelihoods of more than 28 million people across 3 States in India. [Total damage](https://ncds.nic.in/sites/default/files/OEDS3NCDS.pdf) to existing stock of assets has been estimated at over $2.4 billion, whereas the economic losses flowing from the disaster are estimated at nearly ~$1.1 billion. In response to the devastation caused by Cyclone Fani, several resilience-building activities were implemented to enhance disaster preparedness and recovery efforts: - [The Government of Odisha](https://www.unicef.org/media/82111/file/India-Cyclone-Fani-SitRep-12-May-2019.pdf) coordinated one of the largest emergency preparedness exercises, mobilizing over 45,000 volunteers and 100,000 officials to ensure effective communication and evacuation protocols. This effort enabled the successful evacuation of approximately 1.47 million people from low-lying areas before the cyclone made landfall. - The state government constructed hundreds of cyclone shelters along the coast to provide safe refuge during storms, which were stocked with essentials like food and water. - Local stakeholders, NGOs, and civil society organizations collaborated with the government to conduct training programs on disaster preparedness including educating communities about evacuation routes and safety measures The resilience-building activities undertaken after Cyclone Fani reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate response efforts with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. The lessons learned from this cyclone underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in coastal regions like Odisha. #### Flood-Prone Areas Over 40 million hectares (about 12% of India’s land) is [prone to floods and river erosion](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf). The monsoon season often brings heavy rainfall leading to river overflow and flash floods, particularly in states like Assam and Bihar. ##### Assam Floods (2023) Assam, a state in northeastern India, is characterized by its fertile Brahmaputra Valley, which supports a rich agricultural sector. The state’s agriculture is primarily based on rice, tea, and jute, and it benefits from the regular monsoon rains that sustain its crops. The geographical features of Assam, including its river basins and low-lying areas, contribute significantly to its susceptibility to flooding. In 2023, Assam experienced devastating floods that [impacted](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/india-whats-really-behind-assams-worsening-floods) over 2.5 million people. In response to the challenges posed by flooding, particularly following the severe floods in 2023, several resilience-building activities have been undertaken in Assam: - The Assam government allocated Rs 1200 crs in 2023-24 for the [construction and maintenance](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=Infrastructure%20Development%3A%20The%20Assam%20government%20has%20allocated%20Rs%201%2C200%20crore%20for%20the%20construction%20and%20maintenance%20of%20flood%20control%20infrastructure%2C%20including%20embankments%20and%20flood%20barriers%2C%20for%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20period.) of flood control infrastructure, including embarkments and drainage systems and investment aimed to enhance the state's capacity to manage floodwaters effectively and reduce the risk of future inundations. - The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) invested ₹25 crores in developing advanced flood forecasting and early warning systems. These systems provide alerts up to three days in advance, allowing communities to prepare for impending floods and evacuate if necessary. - The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) [covers](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=The%20Pradhan%20Mantri%20Fasal%20Bima%20Yojana%20(PMFBY)%20covers%20around%2056%25%20of%20the%20farmers%20in%20Assam%20as%20of%202023.%20This%20scheme%20provides%20insurance%20coverage%20against%20crop%20losses%20due%20to%20natural%20calamities.) around 56% of farmers in Assam as of 2023, providing insurance against crop losses due to natural calamities. This scheme is crucial for protecting farmers' livelihoods and ensuring financial support during disasters. - A Community-Based Disaster Management project was launched in 2023, aimed at building local capacity for flood management in 100 selected gram panchayats focusing on on empowering communities with knowledge and resources to respond effectively to floods. In 2023, Assam introduced a ' [green budget](https://www.open-contracting.org/2023/09/28/improving-climate-resilience-in-flood-prone-assam-india/)' committing approximately $2 billion towards climate change action and disaster risk reduction, aiming to enhance long-term resilience against climate-related disasters through sustainable development practices. The resilience-building activities implemented in Assam following recent floods reflect a proactive approach to disaster risk reduction. By investing in infrastructure, enhancing early warning systems, promoting community engagement, and introducing innovative financial mechanisms like insurance schemes and green budgets, Assam is working towards building a more resilient agricultural sector capable of withstanding the impacts of flooding. #### Drought and Water Scarcity Drought and water scarcity are significant challenges in India, with [about](https://nidm.gov.in/pdf/trgReports/2021/July/Report_29July2021sk.pdf) 68% of the country's cultivable area vulnerable to these conditions. ##### Rajasthan Drought and Water Scarcity Rajasthan, the largest state in India, faces significant challenges related to water scarcity and drought leading to crop failures and economic distress among farmers. The state has [limited water resources](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/ar/261801490687132806/pdf/113703-WP-Water-Assessment-and-Potential-for-Private-Sector-Interventions-PUBLIC.pdf), with only 1.16% of India's total water supply, making it particularly susceptible to prolonged drought conditions. It's among the most [vulnerable to droughts](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/29/surajpura-rajasthan-india-drought-villagers-farmers-climate#:~:text=ajasthan%2C%20India%E2%80%99s%20largest%20state%2C%20is%20among%20the%20most%20vulnerable%20to%20droughts%2C%20with%2098%25%20of%20its%20250%20village%20blocks%20in%20sectors%20marked%20as%20%E2%80%9Cdark%20zones%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20areas%20with%20dangerously%20low%20groundwater%20levels%20%E2%80%93%20and%20almost%207%25%20of%20the%20land%20uncultivable), with 98% of its 250 village blocks in sectors marked as “dark zones” – areas with dangerously low groundwater levels – and almost 7% of the land uncultivable. In response to the recurring drought conditions, several resilience-building activities have been implemented in Rajasthan: - Rainwater harvesting and water conservation techniques were introduced to mitigate the effects of droughts and were prioritized via traditional techniques such as Anictus, Bairis, and tanks. In 2023, after an [unusually high rainfall](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/climate-opportunity-how-did-rajasthan-harvest-rainwater-after-the-early-monsoon-of-2023--94579) of 588.9 mm (nearly 2X the normal amount) villagers utilized these methods to direct the water into ponds and storage system, providing drinking water [for upto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwXQurAJLKs) 1.5 years in some villages. - The Rajasthan Water Sector Restructuring Project, costing a total of $495 million, of which $345 million is [financed](https://www.ndb.int/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rajasthan-Water-00012.pdf) by the New Development Bank, aimed to rehabilitate the Indira Gandhi Canal System, covering over 990 km of canal systems, reclamation of more than 33,000 km of waterlogged areas, and implementation of micro-irrigation techniques. Government schemes like the [Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana](https://pmksy.gov.in/) (PMKSY) were implemented to focus on enhancing irrigation facilities, along with the introduction of a crop insurance scheme to protect farmers from losses due to drought. Despite these resilience-building efforts, Rajasthan continues to face the challenges posed by recurring droughts. The state's vulnerability is exacerbated by its arid climate, limited water resources, and high dependence on agriculture. Sustained efforts and investments in water management, and agricultural practices are crucial for mitigating the impact of droughts and ensuring food security in the region. #### Topography and Landslides India's diverse topography includes mountainous regions that are particularly vulnerable to landslides and avalanches, especially during the monsoon season. The Himalayan region, along with the Western Ghats, experiences heavy rainfall that can destabilize slopes and trigger landslides. One of the most devastating recent events occurred in Wayanad, Kerala, where a series of landslides on July 30, 2024, resulted in significant loss of life and property. ##### The Wayanad Landslides (2024) On July 30, 2024, Wayanad district in Kerala was struck by catastrophic landslides that resulted from extreme rainfall. [The region](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece) received 572 mm of rainfall within 48 hours leading up to the disaster, causing hillsides to collapse in the villages of Mundakkai and Chooralmala. This resulted in over 336 fatalities, ~397 were injured, and at least 118 missing. The debris flow altered the course of the Iruvanjipuzha River, exacerbating flooding conditions in surrounding areas. The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) [reported](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/86000-sq-metres-of-land-slipped-away-debris-travelled-8-km-along-iruvanjippuzha-river-isro-satellite-images-reveal/articleshow/112231968.cms?from=mdr) that about 86,000 square meters of land had shifted due to the landslide. In response to the Wanayd landslides, several activities were initiated: - A [rescue operation](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece#:~:text=On%20August%201%2C%20Chief%20Minister%20Pinarayi%20Vijayan%20said%20over%209%2C300%20people%20were%20staying%20in%2091%20relief%20camps%20in%20Wayanad%20district.) was mobilized involving the Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and local authorities, over 9,300 people were accommodated in relief camps across the district. - [Experts](https://india.mongabay.com/2024/08/commentary-on-the-trail-of-the-wayanad-landslide/) have called for implementing site-specific land-use policies and improving drainage management to mitigate future risks. Additionally, establishing local landslide early warning systems (LEWS) has been recommended to enhance community preparedness. The Wayanad landslides highlight the urgent need for improved land management practices and disaster preparedness in vulnerable regions of India. By implementing effective resilience-building strategies, including community engagement and infrastructure improvements, it is possible to mitigate the impacts of future landslides and protect lives and livelihoods. India's unique geographical factors significantly contribute to its vulnerability to natural disasters. The country's diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors create a complex landscape of risks, including earthquakes, coastal vulnerability, floods, droughts, landslides, and avalanches. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events due to global warming. To address these challenges, India must adopt a comprehensive approach that integrates disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into its development plans. Building resilient communities requires a multi-faceted strategy that includes strengthening early warning systems, investing in resilient infrastructure, promoting community engagement, and adopting sustainable practices.

    "full_text": "[Defense & Security](https://southasianvoices.org/sav_channels/defense-security) # India-Pakistan Cyber Skirmishes and the Challenge of Attribution Written by [Kashoon Leeza](https://southasianvoices.org/author/kashoon) October 7, 202513 min read **Editor’s Note:** _This essay is part of a series entitled “ [Cybersecurity Threats, Law, and Norms: Priorities for South Asia](https://southasianvoices.org/collection-cyber-south-asia/),” a collaboration between the Stimson Center [Cyber](https://www.stimson.org/program/cyber/) and [South Asia](https://www.stimson.org/program/south-asia/) programs._ The recent India-Pakistan crisis in May illustrated how cyber and artificial intelligence are being integrated into military combat in the subcontinent, a significant development for South Asia’s fragile strategic stability. Along with an exchange of drone strikes, conventional missile firings, and aerial dogfights, the skirmish continued in the information domain, with Pakistani media reporting that the country’s military cyber wing [disrupted](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546050/security-sources-reveal-details-of-pakistans-massive-cyberattack-against-india) a communications network in India, predominantly affecting power distribution lines and government websites. Meanwhile, hackers sympathetic to the Indian government [leaked](https://x.com/cyberforcex) compromised data from Pakistan’s taxation authority and [targeted](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/how-pro-india-hackers-defended-country-during-cross-border-cyberattacks-amid-op-sindoor/articleshow/121385229.cms) other digital infrastructure. The active incorporation of cyber operations in this recent crisis, at least as acknowledged in public media reporting on both sides, is a departure from the past. It also raises serious concerns about the challenge of attribution on the subcontinent. Assigning responsibility for cyber operations comes with political, legal, and technical challenges. For one, in hostile India-Pakistan ties, there is limited space to entertain an ill-substantiated or inaccurate attribution as it risks escalation or creates domestic pressure for retaliation. Also, public attribution may be limited by the lack of well-established national frameworks for doing so. Neither India nor Pakistan currently have an official public attribution policy, making it difficult to assess their evidentiary standards and the validity of their threat intelligence. Limited official documents on procedures for incident response and forensic capacity suggest caution with regard to the credibility of public attribution. Thirdly, in cyber geopolitics, public attribution is a strategic choice determined by decisionmakers on a case-by-case basis. Cyber operations work best when clandestine and thus attribution is often intentionally restricted to avoid exposing technical capability. This is likely why Pakistan and India have generally approached official public attribution for cyber operations with caution in the past. The deployment of cyber-attacks complementary to kinetic operations along with unverifiable and potentially premature public attribution could set a dangerous precedent for a strategic environment as hostile and fragile as South Asia. Thus, in the absence of credible attribution tools and mechanisms, Islamabad and New Delhi would have to firmly resolve to adhere to responsible state behavior in cyberspace by doing the following: 1) establishing a cyber hotline to ensure communication channels are open, 2) supporting the applicability of international law to cyberspace, and 3) committing to non-proliferation of intrusive cyber technologies to non-state Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups to conduct cyber operations on their behalf. [\\[1\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn1) More broadly for each, institutionalizing their attribution process would ensure transparency and reassurance. **India and Pakistan’s Cyber Doctrines** Even apart from its prominent role in the recent India-Pakistan crisis, cybersecurity has found a significant place in both countries’ national security postures in recent years. In 2019, then Indian Minister of State for Defence [confirmed](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-approves-setting-up-of-defence-cyber-agency/articleshow/72264836.cms) the development of a defense cyber agency to handle cyber threats in a military context as well as budgetary allocations for cyber operations. In 2021, India’s former National Security Advisor acknowledged New Delhi’s capability to conduct “ [cyber sabotage and cyber warfare _._](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/M.-K.-Narayanan-on-India-Pakistan-diplomacy-and-terrorism/article55940567.ece)” And in 2024, the Indian Ministry of Defence [announced](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-formulate-new-doctrine-for-cyberspace-operations/articleshow/111094158.cms) a joint doctrine for cyberspace operations, shifting away from the country’s previous policy of strategic ambiguity on the use of cyber in the warfare domain, and integrating both [defensive and offensive capabilities](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2153626). [\\[2\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn2) While Pakistan does not have a pronounced cyber doctrine, Islamabad’s national security posture reflects the necessity of integrating cyber capabilities with military operations. Inaugurating the Army’s Cyber Division in 2018, the then Chief of Army Staff articulated that “ [firepower and cyber have emerged as the mainstay of future war.”](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369646/firepower-cyber-have-emerged-as-mainstay-of-future-war-coas) Pakistan has also invested in cyber capacity, as the [2021 National Cybersecurity Policy](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) reiterates, to protect national critical infrastructure as well as government information systems. These policy documents underline that India and Pakistan recognize the importance of investing in cyber capability to uphold their national interests. The next section explores how each state potentially uses these capabilities for strategic gain. **Cyber Capability and Operations** Countries are increasingly employing state capabilities to conduct cyber operations to achieve strategic objectives such as intelligence gathering; Pakistan and India are no different. Over the past few years, each state is alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage. This is done either through state capability or threat actors backed by the state. Publicly available information suggests that [APT 36](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/apt-36)—also known as [Transparent Tribe](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/transparent-tribe-apt36-pakistan-aligned-threat-actor-expands-interest-in-indian-education-sector/) and [SideCopy](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/operation_c-major)—is a Pakistan-linked APT group, alleged to have conducted cyber [espionage](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) particularly in India and Afghanistan. Likewise, APT groups such as [Sidewinder](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0121/#%3A~%3Atext%3DSidewinder%20is%20a%20suspected%20Indian%2CChina%2C%20Nepal%2C%20and%20Afghanistan) and [Patchwork](https://medium.com/@Ab_Hussain/indian-apts-target-middle-east-1e4a11b3ce95) are thought to be Indian state-backed threat actors, conducting cyber operations in Pakistan and elsewhere. > “Over the past few years, \\[India and Pakistan are\\] alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage.” While there is limited information publicly available regarding the cyber operations conducted by each side, some sources do point to state acquiescence or support. A report by a Canadian firm [revealed](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/media/27613/ocr) that in 2021, the Indian government had allegedly conducted [cyber surveillance](https://www.dawn.com/news/1636767) on Pakistan’s [political leaders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/) using the Israeli [Pegasus software](https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-pegasus-spyware/). India-based hacking groups reportedly continued to [target](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) Pakistani government entities in the following years aiming to infiltrate systems and access computer controls. Similarly, media reports claimed that Pakistan-based hackers had [deployed](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) malware against Indian government and defense sectors, attempting to gain access to sensitive information. In 2019, the cyber-attack on India’s nuclear facility, the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, was thought by some [analysts](https://www.orfonline.org/research/decoding-motives-behind-the-kudankulam-intrusion-58083) to have been perpetrated by Pakistan, though there was no public attribution. The technical attribution by cybersecurity firms [pointed](https://www.vifindia.org/sites/default/files/cyber-attack-on-kudankulam-nuclear-power-plant.pdf) to a North Korean state-sponsored entity, the Lazarus Group. This complex picture of the potential use of proxies points to the challenge of attribution in an India-Pakistan context. **The Attribution Challenge** Attribution in cyberspace is the process of identifying and assigning responsibility to threat actors behind the cyber operation or malicious activity. However, attribution is rarely straightforward because, unlike physical crimes, cyber actors can hide behind the anonymity of the internet or impersonate other computers. Threat actors can also remain in the system undetected, silently stealing information through stolen passwords or impersonation. In terms of technical challenges, the sophistication of the operation depending on capability could also make it difficult to trace the crime back to an actor. For instance, during the India-Pakistan crisis in May, the Indian cyber agency, Maharashtra Cyber, reported a significant surge in cyber-attacks [originating](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-sindoor-and-india-pakistans-escalated-rivalry-cyberspace#:~:text=noted%20a%20surge%20in%20DDoS,in%20these%20cyberattacks%20as%20it) from Pakistan as well as countries like Indonesia, Morocco, and Bangladesh. Threat actors using the location of a third country is often a deliberate and popular tactic to confuse the perpetrator’s identity and origin, as an IP address is usually the first source of identification. A popular global example is the 2018 [Olympic Destroyer cyberattack in South Korea](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/olympic-destroyer/21494/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20the,uproar%20was%20no%20laughing%20matter.), when the [Russian threat actors](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/) used sophisticated tactics to conceal their identity, enabling the blame to be deflected to North Korea and China. Thus, even if one actor might visibly be responsible, there might be someone else behind the keyboard. Moreover, technical attribution requires advanced threat intelligence capability, without which attribution could be erroneous and enable “false flag” categorization. For example, recently, Russian state-linked cyber group Turla allegedly attempted to access data exfiltrated from Indian military networks. Threat intelligence by Microsoft and Lumen’s BlackLotus Labs indicate that Turla [compromised a network](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) of Pakistan-based group SideCopy to spy on the Indian network. This created a false impression, shifting the blame towards Pakistan. This reiterates that the use of sophisticated techniques in an operation and the lack of advanced capability for forensic analysis can potentially obscure a threat actor’s identity, making attribution a challenge. Even advanced nations struggle with having requisite forensic capacity, so relatively newer cyber entrants like India and Pakistan will have to invest more efforts in this space. The key legal challenge India and Pakistan face regarding attribution is the lack of a transparent, and credible attribution framework. Unlike some countries, India and Pakistan do not have a formal attribution policy, making it difficult for independent analysts to assess the validity of their institutional processes. In practice, the process involves a loose [network of agencies](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/mapping-indias-cybersecurity-administration-in-2025?lang=en) coordinating technical and intelligence findings, raising concerns about the lack of consistent and verifiable evidentiary standards. It was in highlighting some of these challenges that Pakistan’s 2023 [position](https://docs-library.unoda.org/Open-Ended_Working_Group_on_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_-_(2021)/UNODA.pdf) on applicability of international law in cyberspace emphasized cross-border coordination and cooperation globally to ensure substantiated attribution. A lack of consistent evidentiary standards complicates attribution and can leave such efforts open to criticism as being politically motivated, making it critical for India and Pakistan to address this lacuna. This leads to the political challenge of attribution. The United States and [Five Eyes](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/fv-cntry-mnstrl-en.aspx) allies often attribute cyber-attacks when they need to reinforce international pressure on political adversaries or justify policy shifts. New Delhi and Islamabad have approached attribution rather cautiously. Though there are multiple reasons for this, the obvious one is to avoid jumping the gun and pointing to an adversary, which may create a particularly dangerous scenario of escalation. **Redefining Crises and Stability in South Asia** Attribution uncertainty creates costs for stability in South Asia and risks escalation in a future India- Pakistan crisis. Both countries share a hostile past and a tense strategic environment, leaving limited space for misunderstanding and miscalculation. A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing, tarnishing trust on both sides and instilling doubt. Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression. Pakistan’s 2021 Cyber Security Policy explicitly mentions that a cyberattack on critical infrastructure would be regarded as an [act of aggression](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) and be met with an appropriate response. > “A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing \\[…\\] Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression.” Another predicament is the question of proportionate response to an offensive cyber intrusion conducted by a state or state-linked threat actors without clear attribution. This is a conundrum faced by states globally, not just India and Pakistan. Determining what is a proportionate response in cyberspace currently lies at the discretion of the state. Some countries have included the principle of proportionality in formal statements unpacking how they interpret international law as applying to their conduct in cyberspace. According to its 2023 statement, while Pakistan acknowledges proportionality as applying in the context of conflict and international humanitarian law, it does not otherwise present views on response. India has not yet published a national statement. Such norms and behavior are either unaddressed or awaiting legal applicability in international frameworks. For the complicated security environment of South Asia, integration of cyber capability without legal clarity is thus worrisome. In times of active conflict, cyber operations, including information and influence operations, can create a [fog of war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQvsb4ouuI0) for decisionmakers and undermine the process of crisis management. Persistent cyber intrusions could also further compromise trust and impact and possibly backtrack the confidence-building measures (CBMs) already in place between India and Pakistan. Given that nuclear CBMs between India and Pakistan are already tenuous, a potential cyber-attack or even a data breach could be misperceived as altering the balance of power. **Policy Recommendations** To ensure that cyber does not introduce yet another element of uncertainty and that the precarious balance of power is maintained on the subcontinent, policymakers in India and Pakistan should: **_Establish a cyber hotline:_** Cyber operations can perpetuate misperception and misunderstanding, especially with attribution challenges. Therefore, rapid communication during a cyber crisis is critical. Both countries could exchange doctrines, ensure technical cooperation, and maintain a directory in case of crisis. Cyber CBMs, including hotlines and dedicated focal points for exchange, can also potentially enhance a sense of predictability. **_Support the applicability of international law to cyberspace:_** While there is consensus across the board that international law applies to cyberspace, states are still discussing how core legal principles and existing commitments, such as the non-use of force, proportionality, sovereignty, and due diligence, apply to cyberspace. Islamabad and New Delhi are advised to actively adhere to international and bilateral negotiations, such as the UN’s recently launched Global Mechanism on ICTs, successor to the Open-ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies. Pakistan published its national position paper in 2023 outlining the applicability of international law. India could follow suit, to maintain accountability and transparency. **_Commit to restraining proliferation of offensive intrusion capabilities:_** To dodge attribution and accountability, states often employ non-state APT groups to influence cyber operations. This results in proliferation of sophisticated intrusive cyber technologies and capabilities to non-state threat actors, not bound by rules and norms of state responsibility. Cyber operations through non-state APT actors help maintain plausible deniability. India and Pakistan should refrain from transferring capabilities to non-state APT groups to ensure responsible state behavior and maintain stability. **_Institutionalize attribution:_** To ensure responsible state behavior, both India and Pakistan should consider improving their attribution process. Institutionalizing the process and detailing their evidentiary standards to substantiate the findings will build confidence in their intelligence and threat assessments. Publishing a national attribution policy would explain the objectives behind disclosing a breach or attack, beyond merely aiming for political scoring. Further, both states could also benefit from investing in legal and technical capacity-building for attribution, including in collaboration with private entities and multilateral partnerships. As their decades-long hostilities spill over into cyberspace, there is likely a higher probability of cyber operations increasing in an India-Pakistan context. Realizing the serious implications of cyber threats to strategic stability, Pakistan and India are advised to seriously engage in the measures above that would reduce misperception, increase accountability and transparency, and indicate their commitments to the norms and practices of international law and responsible state behavior during conflict and peace time. _Views expressed are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the positions of South Asian Voices, the Stimson Center, or our supporters._ Also Read: [Cyber Quicksand?

The loss of electricity cost Spain an estimated $1.82 billion in economic output and damages. When the Iberian grid collapsed, people who were going about their day moments before were now [stuck in elevators](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/iberia-power-cut-leaves-people-trapped-lifts-trains-or-stocking-up-supermarkets-2025-04-28/), food in freezers and refrigerators began to thaw or spoil, and non-urgent medical needs [were delayed](https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/04/29/amid-major-outage-health-workers-in-spain-and-portugal-adapted-to-provide-urgent-care-with) as hospitals dealt with scarce backup power supplies. Quickly, pundits, experts, and posters on social media descended on the details of the blackout, grabbing what information they could, and spewing hot takes: “Solar is to blame.” “Why did the nuclear power plants go offline?” “Green energies and renewables did this.” “Aha, nuclear plants were in planned outage.” Schadenfreude abounds when systems begin to break, especially when aspects of those systems are politically charged. Fifteen hours later, the transmission grids of Spain and Portugal were restored to full operation. Electrons once again flowed to people’s homes, charging their phones, illuminating their rooms, cooling their food, and providing them with modern comforts. The question of how the blackout happened remained. In June, Red Eléctrica de España (REE), the Spanish grid operator, released [a report](https://www.ree.es/en/press-office/news/press-release/2025/06/red-electrica-presents-report-incident-28-april-and-proposes-recommendations) detailing the events that led to the blackout. The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) is currently undertaking a more thorough [investigation of the incident](https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/blackout/28-april-2025-iberian-blackout/#Introduction). Electric grids form the backbone of our economies. If a grid fails, it is necessary to understand why, learn from the failure, and take precautions so that it does not happen again or on another system. Doing so entails finding the true cause of the failure. If politics or opinions obfuscate the results, it may solve nothing and may make the system more vulnerable than it was before. In this case, a malfunctioning solar plant disrupted the Spanish grid and led to a feedback loop that ultimately caused it to collapse. As more variable renewable energy sources are being added to the grid, it is worth considering that our old systems for ensuring reliability might not be enough. ## The Blackout #### _7:00:00 AM CET, 5 hours 33 minutes 24 seconds until grid collapse_ The morning of April 28th in the Iberian Peninsula was ideal for mid-spring. It promised to be a windy day, and the sun would be out in full force. Grid operations were normal, and a variety of natural gas, combustion, and nuclear generators were running smoothly. Most of the electricity generation around the world—Spain included—is done by heating a fluid and sending the vapor into a turbine, which then spins the components inside a generator. The large, spinning generators, whether steam, combustion, or water driven, also create frequency and voltage as they output energy. Most of the power being generated throughout the early morning was from these spinning generators. Between 7:15 and 7:20, rays of sunlight began to hit the solar photovoltaic panels across the peninsula. Solar photovoltaics and wind often transmit their energy through inverters. An inverter changes power from DC to AC power before heading to the grid, and also makes sure the outgoing power matches the parameters of the grid. Unlike spinning resources, which “form” the grid, solar and wind “follow” the grid and lack the inertia to help dampen grid fluctuations. By 9:30, the solar radiance had increased significantly, sending more energy to the grid. As wind and solar provided more power to the grid, other generators, like natural gas turbines and nuclear power plants, were asked to reduce output or go on standby. As the spinning generators turned off, there were fewer and fewer grid-forming resources on the grid. #### _12:00:00, 33 minutes 24 seconds until grid collapse_ Between 10:30 and 11:45 that morning, the operator saw voltage fluctuations on both 220 kV and 400 kV transmission lines, but none of the fluctuations were outside the limits of safe operation. It is not unusual for grids to see oscillations throughout normal operation; most of them are dampened within seconds and have little-to-no impact on the grid as a whole. By noon, the fluctuations had calmed to normal conditions. Three minutes later, at 12:03, a voltage and frequency swing disrupted the grid. The oscillation originated in the province of Badajoz at what REE refers to as “Photovoltaic Plant A.” At the time of the oscillations, it was generating approximately 250 MW. The oscillation continued for four minutes and forty-two seconds. As power is generated, spinning generators create frequency, which allows for synchronization of the generation fleet. All of the online generators have to be spinning at the same frequency across the grid, no matter how many hundreds or thousands of miles of cable are in between them. As generators spin and people demand electricity by turning on electronics, the differential between the two creates pressure, like a push and pull of electrons, across the wires. This is called voltage. Much like frequency, voltage needs to be maintained and must be regulated across the grid. Transformers will step up and down the voltage as necessary for the power line rating and to deliver power to consumers safely. Fluctuations and oscillations occur on all grids during normal operations in response to the loss of one generator or wire, for example. When this happens, a generator and/or the power flow on a part of the grid may go slightly out of sync with the rest of the grid. Most of the time, these fluctuations disappear within seconds. If unnatural oscillations persist, then the grid will begin to experience problems, and the generators may go out of sync with each other or the interconnections. Large fluctuations may cause safety systems to engage, causing lines, transformer substations, and generators to disconnect from the grid. To dampen the oscillations caused by Photovoltaic Plant A, REE adjusted the power operations between Spain and France, coupled power lines within Spain, and reduced the flow of energy being exported into the country. These operations helped lower the disruption caused by the oscillations When the operator reduced the flows between Spain and France, the voltages across the system were also increased. Between 12:07 and 12:15, 600 MW of generating resources disconnected from the grid. Most of it was likely wind and solar resources that used inverters not sufficiently equipped to handle the fluctuations and increasing voltage plaguing the grid. By 12:15, power flows across the border with France had increased, negating the previous actions and setting the stage for more oscillations. #### _12:19:00, 14 minutes 24 seconds until grid collapse_ At 12:19, another oscillation hit the Spanish grid, lasting for three minutes. Photovoltaic Plant A in Badajoz had increased its output from 250 MW to 350 MW. REE reported that its electricity output was stable, but the voltage, or pressure, being placed on the grid was not. This time, the oscillation caused the frequency of the whole Iberian grid to be slightly offset by 0.21 Hz. The oscillation and its repetitions on the Spanish grid were not natural to the system, but were forced, or exogenous to the transmission lines. A forced oscillation occurs when something external to a system causes a disruption to the frequency of that system. Inverter-based resources, like wind and solar, can [cause these kinds of forced oscillations](https://www.nerc.com/comm/RSTC_Reliability_Guidelines/Reliability_Guideline_-_Forced_Oscillations_-_2017-07-31_-_FINAL.pdf) on electric grids. For reasons that remain unclear, the inverter sending power from Photovoltaic Plant A was malfunctioning. REE was able to get the oscillations under control once again by reducing power flows between Spain and France while coupling more power lines within Spain. In the meantime, 500 MW more of small, behind-the-meter resources disconnected from the grid. As of 12:30, over half of the 32 GW being generated in Spain was coming from solar. Electricity prices had gone negative, and Spain was exporting over 3.5 GW to neighboring countries; the electricity was in the realm of “too cheap to meter,” but cracks were beginning to show. REE sent start instructions to the combined cycle gas turbines and a nuclear power plant to help stabilize the grid. These units would not materialize in time. #### _12:32:00, 1 minute 24 seconds until grid collapse_ Between 12:32:00 and 12:32:57, an additional 500 MW of wind and solar disconnected from the grid. The loss of these units caused the transmission line voltage to begin increasing and exceeding the system parameters. Voltage on the broader transmission network then began to rise. The distribution transformers had built-in “safety valves” to release the excess voltage, which were configured to maintain proper voltage levels in those networks. When the voltage increased, the safety mechanisms within the transformers failed to respond quickly enough, causing overvoltages in the distribution networks, even though primary transformer voltages remained within acceptable limits. The transmission and distribution infrastructure found itself in a feedback loop. The oscillations from Photovoltaic Plant A caused a rise in voltage, which then caused [solar and wind to trip offline](http://power.eng.usf.edu/docs/papers/2022/subcycle_overvoltage.pdf). This, in turn, increased the voltage further, causing even more generation to be disconnected. Three more generation loss events happened in rapid succession: #### _12:32:57, 27 seconds until grid collapse_ A transformer connected to a generator tripped on the low-voltage side in Grenada. 355 MW of solar PV, wind, and thermal solar were lost as a result. #### _12:33:16, 8 seconds until grid collapse_ 725 MW of solar PV and thermal solar were disconnected in Badajoz. #### _12:33:17, 7 seconds until grid collapse_ In less than one second, 1,100 MW of generation was lost. This included wind farms in Seguira and Huelva, solar PV in Badajoz, Seville, Cáceres, and Huelva, and thermal solar in Badajoz. 930 MW of the 1,100 MW have been identified as belonging to wind and solar; the remaining 170 MW are still under investigation. Unlike the large spinning turbines and generators, solar panels and wind turbines do not produce inertia. When oscillations occur, the inertia of the spinning generator, or the kinetic energy of the rotor’s mass, helps dampen the fluctuations and prevents the grid from destabilizing. Wind and solar instead rely on inverters that match, or “follow,” the state of the grid as they produce power. Most inverters used in solar are grid-following. If the frequency or voltage on the line connected to the solar farm goes outside a preset range, then a safety mechanism will disconnect the farm from the grid to protect the power electronics. Without more advanced inverters, which are only just beginning to enter wider use, renewables cannot tolerate fluctuating conditions on the grid. By this point, 2,200 MW of generating assets had disconnected from the grid in the past 20 seconds. #### _12:33:18, 6 seconds until grid collapse_ The voltage along the transmission corridors continued to increase sharply. Overvoltage triggered a cascade of generation losses. The frequency began to drop. #### _12:33:19, 5 seconds until grid collapse_ Automatic load shedding and system defense plans, both grid protection measures, were initiated to save the grid from collapse. Automatic load shedding is a measure in which the computers controlling the grid disconnect non-essential demand, like residential load, from the grid in an attempt to keep the larger grid from failing. Usually, this occurs when either frequency or voltage falls out of range. The load shedding can be targeted in a few areas or shared across a grid in what is known as rolling blackouts and rolling brownouts. The load shedding is supposed to allow generators more time to come online and balance the grid. System defense plans are a series of actions that go into effect to prevent system-wide failure. These include specific thresholds for which actions to take and when. They are modeled in advance and comply with best known practices. [ENTSO-E has developed plans](https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/SOC%20documents/Regional_Groups_Continental_Europe/2022/220215_RGCE_TOP_03.2_D.1_System%20Defence%20Plan_v8_final.pdf) for REE and other European grid operators to follow. #### _12:33:20, 4 seconds until grid collapse_ The AC connections between Spain and Morocco tripped due to the Spanish grid’s frequency dropping below the acceptable limits. Grid interconnections and electricity imports and exports enhance reliability by allowing regions to share power during shortages or emergencies, reducing the risk of blackouts. Interconnections improve economic efficiency by enabling cheaper electricity from surplus regions to flow to areas with higher demand and prices. They also enable other generators and resources throughout the region to assist in dampening voltage and frequency fluctuations. However, a sufficiently large fluctuation or failure in one region of a larger interconnected grid risks spreading the emergency across the entire large-scale system. #### _12:33:21, 3 seconds until grid collapse_ The AC ties between France and Spain were disconnected. The frequency of the Spanish grid went so far outside its bounds that safety equipment engaged to prevent the disruption and oscillations from spreading outside the peninsula. #### _12:33:22, 2 seconds until grid collapse_ Automatic load shedding and defense measures failed. #### _12:33:23, 1 second until grid collapse_ Generation losses continued to cascade. Spinning generation also began disconnecting from the grid. Discrepancies between the grid frequency and the spinning rotor can risk severe mechanical damage, forcing generators to shut down. However, inertia in spinning generators acts as a damper, smoothing out small oscillations and resisting larger ones to slow the rate of change. Spain’s spinning generation stayed connected to the grid until the conditions exceeded their tolerances. Safety measures caused nuclear units to disconnect from the grid. #### _12:33:24, grid collapse_ Blackout. 27 seconds after generation began disconnecting from the grid because of overvoltage, 50 million people across the entirety of Spain and Portugal were left without power. #### _12:35:00, 2 minutes after grid collapse_ Quickly following the initial blackout, blackstart efforts began. The Castelo de Bode hydropower plant and the Tapada do Outeiro combined cycle gas turbine power plant turned on in blackstart mode. Minutes later, a 400kV transmission line interconnected with France was re-energized. Slowly over the next 15 hours, the grid was brought back online, line-by-line and section-by-section. Blackstarting is a rare occurrence. Most outages are localized and can be resolved with the help of neighboring unaffected parts of the grid, as opposed to blackstarts, which require starting up generators and sending power to dead lines. Traditionally, hydro units and combustion turbines are used to start up a power grid from scratch; both have enough inertia to keep producing power and synchronizing with each other. Nuclear is also capable of blackstarting; Bruce Nuclear Power Plant, hosting CANDU reactors, helped the blackstart efforts during the 2003 Northeastern Blackout. Grid-forming inverters with battery systems could, in theory, also help blackstart, but that technology has just started to come on the market. External interconnections can also be used to help prop up the failed system during a restart. #### _April 29th, 04:00:00, 15.5 hours after grid collapse_ The Spanish and Portuguese grids were fully restored and operational. ## Could a Similar Blackout Hit the American Grid? The physics underpinning the grid remain the same, no matter the country or location. The Iberian blackout caused a flurry of concern amongst grid operators and reliability organizations. A month after the blackout, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) gave a [presentation](https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/presentation-iberian-peninsula-blackout-april-2025) to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in which several potential areas of concern were identified: - Insufficient voltage regulation to handle large oscillations - Unreliable voltage regulation to prevent a system collapse - Poor tolerance of inverter-based resources to handle voltage oscillations - Potential gaps in operations planning The key [lesson learned](https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/presentation-iberian-peninsula-blackout-april-2025) by US grid operators and NERC was that if increased voltage leads to generators tripping, which then results in a lowering of frequency, load shedding measures meant to protect the grid will cause voltages to increase further if there is not enough spinning generation. If the US grid had seen a similar situation to the Iberian grid before April 2025, load shedding would have commenced, voltages would have increased, and parts of the American grid could have collapsed. It is unlikely that the whole American grid would have collapsed, but millions of people could have been without power. Now, operators are more aware of this scenario, but it is not apparent that a cascading failure could be prevented. The main culprit of the Iberian blackout looks to be overvoltage of the transmission lines as generators were disconnected from the grid. Could additional spinning resources, like nuclear and natural gas, have prevented the blackout? Was more than half of all generation coming from renewables too much for the grid to handle? REE maintains that additional inertia would not have saved the grid from failure, and only delayed the eventual failure of the grid due to increasing voltage and tripping renewables. This may be true, but even a few additional seconds made available by more inertia could have been enough to allow for automatic load shedding or other protection measures to keep at least parts of the grid operating. April 28th was not the first time the Spanish grid was operating with over 50% wind and solar; on April 16th, 2025, wind and solar output met over [73% of demand](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/04/22/spain-hits-first-weekday-of-100-renewable-power-on-national-grid/). Other grids routinely operate on large amounts of inverter-based resources; Australia, Texas, and California all generate large portions of their energy mix from wind and solar. Australia uses grid-forming inverters to maintain reliability and keeps a number of gas turbines spinning to help regulate the grid, but not producing much power. Texas has a market for fast frequency response. California relies on the flexibility of gas generators and help from its neighboring grids. One tool missing from Spain’s grid was battery storage. Spain only had 60 MW of battery energy storage. As a comparison, ERCOT in Texas has 11,000 MW of battery storage, and the California ISO has over 13,000 MW; with increased battery storage, Texas and California have [gained better reliability](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/california-texas-blackouts-energy-storage-trump-renewable-energy/742229/) from their grids. Batteries allow for instantaneous discharging of power and can offer grid services like voltage and frequency regulation. Had Spain invested more in battery storage alongside grid-forming inverters, the blackout might have never happened or might have stayed localized to a smaller area. As technologies have developed and been introduced to energy systems, the grid has grown in its complexity. Intermittent resources and renewables added an extra layer of complexity to what is already a complex system. The structures and institutions that govern the grid were made when all the generation was made up of large fossil fuel plants and hydroelectric turbines; the specific cascading failure seen in Spain would have been unlikely in a more conventional grid. These institutions need to evolve with the technology; if they don’t, the grid will become increasingly unreliable. ## Conclusion Some are waiting expectantly for the results of official investigations into what caused the Iberian blackout; they want some person, policy, or technology to blame. But, electrical systems are not so simple as to care about your pet policies. We need a wide variety of generation sources and types: stable baseload power to always be on and provide generation in all hours of the day; quick, responsive power for when demand is changing rapidly; and emergency power for when there are outages. Grids are more reliable when there is diversity. Nuclear, natural gas, wind, hydroelectric dams, diesel, geothermal, and coal can all contribute to a resilient system. The REE report does not blame wind and solar explicitly, but the operator does point to the Photovoltaic Plant A as being the source of the oscillations that began to knock behind-the-meter generation off the grid. As generation disconnected, the voltage on transmission lines increased. This knocked more wind and solar generation offline, including grid-scale resources, and voltage increased further until there was a cascading failure. When REE tried to bring gas and nuclear online to help, there wasn’t enough lead time for those resources to start up before the grid collapsed. No matter how one looks at it, a solar installation malfunctioned and started the chain reaction that caused the blackout. In the United States, we are fortunate to have the expectation of reliable power. The average power loss across an entire year is only 6 hours. Not all of the world has the luxury of electricity powering their lives 24/7. For some, blackouts and brownouts are a daily occurrence. For others, there is no power to go out. Over a billion people, most of them in Africa, [lack access to electricity](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/opendata/1-18-billion-around-the-world-are-unable-to-use-electricity) at all. Most people take the electrical grid for granted. As long as the electrons flow through their lights and devices, people don’t give a second thought to what it takes to create and deliver that power. The electric grid is the largest complex system ever made by humanity. The grid is undertaking a giant balancing act; every second is a new equilibrium. Choices about the grid based on politics or preference may undermine the system. As technology develops and the world moves away from fossil fuel generators, the governance of these systems must also evolve.

Pakistani hackers attacked 1.5 million-plus Indian websites after Operation Sindoor: Failure rate, names of 7 Pakistani hacker groups; techniques used and more [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Oct 13, 2025, 14:23 IST Share AA + **Text Size** - Small - Medium - Large Following the Pahalgam terror strike, Maharashtra Cyber identified seven APT groups, primarily Pakistan-allied, responsible for over 1.5 million cyber attacks targeting critical Indian infrastructure. While only 150 attacks succeeded, these groups employed malware, DDoS attacks, and misinformation campaigns. The attacks originated from Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Middle East, and Indonesia, with some successful defacements and alleged data theft. Representational AI image Maharashtra Cyber has reportedly identified seven Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups responsible for launching over 15 lakh cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure websites across India following the Pahalgam terror strike. Of these, only 150 attacks were successful, officials said, as per a report by news agency PTI. This means a failure rate of 99.99% or should one say abysmal success rate of 0.01%.In a report titled \"Road of Sindoor\", prepared under the military operation launched by the Indian armed forces under the same name against terrorists, the state's nodal cyber agency has detailed the cyber warfare launched by Pakistan-allied hacking groups. The report has been submitted to all key law enforcement agencies, including the Director General of Police and the State Intelligence Department.According to the report, these cyber attacks originated from Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Middle East, and an Indonesian group, said Yashasvi Yadav, Additional Director General of Police, Maharashtra Cyber. ## India-Pakistan Ceasefire has not stopped Pakistani hackers Even after India and Pakistan reached an understanding to stop military hostilities, Indian government websites are facing a barrage of cyber attacks from the neighbouring country as well as from Bangladesh and the Middle Eastern region, they said.\"The probe discovered that cyber attacks on (government websites in) India decreased after India-Pakistan ceased hostilities, but not fully stopped. These attacks continue from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Morocco, and Middle Eastern countries,\" he said.Pakistani hackers bringing down websites of major airports in India, Election Commission and ...Addressing reporters, a senior official of Maharashtra Cyber debunked claims of hackers stealing data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai, hacking aviation and municipal systems, and targeting the Election Commission website. ## Techniques used by Pakistani hackers The methods used by hackers included malware campaigns, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and GPS spoofing. The defacement of Indian websites was also reported. He said many such attacks were thwarted, and critical infrastructure of India was saved.The report also highlights a hybrid warfare strategy by Pakistan-allied groups that includes widespread misinformation campaigns. These groups falsely claimed to have hacked India's banking system and caused power outages. These false narratives included claims of cyber attacks on India's power grid, statewide blackouts, satellite jamming, disruption of the Northern Command, and an alleged attack on a BrahMos missile storage facility, Yadav said.Maharashtra Cyber identified and removed over 5,000 instances of misinformation and fake news related to India-Pakistan military conflicts that were circulating on social media. ## 7 Pakistani Hacker groups that attacked Indian websites The seven hacking groups identified in the report are APT 36 (Pakistan-based), Pakistan Cyber Force, Team Insane PK, Mysterious Bangladesh, Indo Hacks Sec, Cyber Group HOAX 1337, and National Cyber Crew (Pakistan-allied). These groups collectively launched approximately 1.5 million targeted cyber attacks on Indian infrastructure, Yadav said. ## The Indian websites Pakistani hackers brought down Among the 150 successful attacks, the Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council website was defaced. The attackers also claimed to have stolen data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), as well as from telecom companies, with some of the data allegedly appearing on the darknet. Additionally, the website of the Defence Nursing College in Jalandhar was defaced. **About the Author** [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) The TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

    "full_text": "Author : [Soumya Awasthi](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/soumya-awasthi) ###### [**Expert Speak**](https://www.orfonline.org/content-type/expert-speak) [Raisina Debates](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak-category/raisina-debates-review) ##### Published on **Oct 14, 2025** > _APT36’s targeting of India’s BOSS Linux system reveals the expanding scope of Pakistan’s cyber-espionage operations, underscoring the urgent need for India to strengthen its digital defence architecture._ Following Operation Sindoor, the Pakistan-linked threat group APT36, also known as Transparent Tribe, has [targeted India’s Bharat Operating System Solutions](https://sundayguardianlive.com/news/pakistan-linked-cyber-espionage-group-targets-indian-institutions-137611/) (BOSS) Linux [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/www.orfonline.org#_ftn1) operating system numerous times. This marks a significant departure from the group’s usual playbook, which has been centred on Windows-centric malware and spear-phishing lures. By expanding its reach to compromise BOSS Linux, a system widely adopted by Indian government entities, APT36 is signalling not merely a technical upgrade but a deliberate escalation on the cyber-espionage front in the India-Pakistan rivalry. APT36’s targeting of BOSS Linux indicates a calculated attempt to undermine confidence in this indigenous platform. A successful breach not only grants access to sensitive communications and classified data but also erodes institutional faith in self-reliant technological ecosystems. This outcome serves Pakistan’s interests on multiple levels: tactically, by harvesting intelligence; and strategically, by discrediting India’s efforts at digital autonomy. > By expanding its reach to compromise BOSS Linux, a system widely adopted by Indian government entities, APT36 is signalling not merely a technical upgrade but a deliberate escalation on the cyber-espionage front in the India-Pakistan rivalry. The discovery of this campaign underscores an uncomfortable reality: Pakistan-based cyber actors, often operating under the aegis of state agencies or enjoying tacit state protection, are evolving their capabilities beyond low-level phishing attacks into strategically targeted, cross-platform espionage operations. This trend holds profound implications for India’s national security, not least because it compromises trust in indigenous technologies developed as alternatives to foreign software ecosystems. ## Anatomy of the New Campaign The latest intrusion by APT36 begins with a familiar vector, spear-phishing emails. Camouflaged as official government correspondence, these emails deliver compressed archives containing malicious desktop files. Unlike traditional Windows executables, these shortcuts are designed explicitly for Linux environments and crafted to resemble innocuous PDF files. When executed, the desktop file triggers a [series of covert commands](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments) embedded in its Exec field. Utilities such as ‘curl’ and ‘xxd’ are then employed to fetch a hex-encoded payload from [attacker-controlled infrastructure](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments), decode it, and silently deploy it under the temporary directory. With execution rights granted, [the payload operates silently](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments) in the background, all while the user is distracted by a decoy PDF opened in parallel. > Forensic evidence suggests a Pakistan state-backed effort, given the substantial resources expended on developing BOSS Linux-specific attack chains and maintaining redundant infrastructure. The campaign is more than an opportunistic strike; it is an assault on India’s technological sovereignty. Persistence is achieved by ensuring that the [malware relaunches upon every login.](https://cloudsek.com/blog/investigation-report-apt36-malware-campaign-using-desktop-entry-files-and-google-drive-payload-delivery) Its communications are funnelled to command-and-control (C2) nodes and the newly registered domain, both of which reflect a carefully coordinated campaign.

The campaign is more than an opportunistic strike; it is an assault on India’s technological sovereignty. ## Pakistan’s Cyber-Espionage Landscape [Pakistan-supported hacking groups](https://cyble.com/threat-actor-profiles/transparenttribe/) collectively serve Islamabad’s strategic agenda. [APT 36, also known as Transparent Tribe](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/apt-profile-transparent-tribe-aka-apt36/), is primarily focused on cyber espionage against the Indian government, targeting Indian defence personnel, diplomatic missions, and critical infrastructure. Its preferred tactics have included malware-laden documents, watering-hole attacks, and social engineering through fake recruitment portals. There have been reports of a [link between other APT-based groups](https://cybersrcc.com/2025/05/02/pakistan-linked-sidecopy-hackers-escalate-indian-cyberattacks-with-curlback-rat-and-spark-rat/#:~:text=SideCopy%20is%20a%20Pakistan%2Dlinked,and%20now%2C%20critical%20infrastructure%20sectors.), such as [SideCopy, SideWinder](https://cyble.com/threat-actor-profiles/transparenttribe/), and [TransparentTribe](https://socradar.io/dark-web-profile-apt36/). These groups often share infrastructure, malware families, or operational overlaps, suggesting either coordination or common direction by Pakistan’s intelligence services, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). ## A Global Nexus: Pakistan Supporting Hackers Beyond Borders While India remains the principal target, Pakistan-based hackers have extended their reach internationally, either independently or in collaboration with other state-linked actors. Several examples illustrate this global dimension. For instance, in 2021, soon after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, Pakistan-linked hackers engaged in a campaign [against Afghan government](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-says-hackers-from-pakistan-targeted-people-in-the-previous-afghan-government/article37537222.ece) and civil society networks, consolidating Islamabad’s influence and monitoring rival factions. Similarly, there have been reported overlaps between Pakistani hacker groups and [campaigns affecting Gulf states](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/saudi-arabia-uae-face-brunt-apt-cyber-attacks-middle-east-threatcop-gwecc/), particularly those hosting large Indian diasporas. Espionage here has dual value: monitoring Indian activities abroad and gaining leverage with Gulf governments. Security firms have observed occasional alignment between Pakistani actors and broader anti-Western cyber campaigns, some with tacit [Chinese or Iranian involvement](https://www.indiandefensenews.in/2025/06/chinas-support-for-pakistan-and-iran.html#:~:text=Tuesday%2C%20June%2017%2C%202025%20by,desire%20to%20counterbalance%20Western%20influence.). These collaborations may be opportunistic rather than formal. Still, they indicate a willingness on the part of Pakistani hackers to position themselves as part of the global anti-Western cyber-espionage ecosystem. > As India promotes platforms like BOSS Linux, there should be a mandatory and more rigorous security certification framework led by CERT-In, DRDO, and the National Informatics Centre (NIC). In essence, Pakistan has fostered an environment where state priorities, cybercrime networks, and ideological motivations blur into a hybrid threat matrix. The state benefits from plausible deniability while reaping the intelligence dividends of global cyber operations. ## **Evolution of Capabilities** Over the past decade, Pakistan-based hackers have evolved from low-level disruptors into sophisticated cyber-espionage actors. Between 2010 and 2014, their operations primarily involved [website defacements](https://www.idsa.in/publisher/issuebrief/digital-war-pakistans-cyber-activity-against-india), online propaganda, and basic [phishing attacks](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/apt36-a-phishing-campaign-targeting-indian-government-entities/#:~:text=An%20investigation%20into%20the%20domain%20revealed%20a%20notable%20connection%20to,targeting%20of%20Indian%20government%20entities.) aimed at embarrassing Indian institutions. From 2015 to 2019, groups like [APT36 matured technically](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/apt36-refines-tools-attacks-indian-targets#:~:text=APT36%20Refines%20Tools%20in%20Attacks%20on%20Indian%20Targets%20APT36%20Refines,Step%2Dby%2DStep%20Cyberattack%20Capability), shifting toward credential theft, malware infiltration, and sustained surveillance of India’s defence and diplomatic networks. The period 2020 to 2024 marked a cross-platform expansion, with Pakistan-linked actors [developing Android malware](https://therecord.media/android-malware-alleged-pakistan-espionage-campaign-india#:~:text=Android%20malware%20used%20in%20six,logs%20and%20delete%20all%20contacts.) targeting Indian military personnel through fake applications and deploying advanced Windows-based trojans with layered obfuscation. By 2025, the focus had moved to Linux-specific targeting, particularly against India’s indigenous BOSS Linux system. This development signals dedicated research capacity and a state-backed commitment to penetrating critical digital infrastructure. Such a trajectory reflects Pakistan’s transition from a nuisance-level cyber actor to a structured, strategic, and offensive one that directly threatens India’s technological and national security landscape. ## Strategic Implications for India The attack on India’s BOSS Linux should not be viewed as an isolated cyber incident but as part of a broader transnational security challenge unfolding in the grey zone of hybrid warfare. Pakistan’s strategy has long employed a blend of conventional, sub-conventional, and informational tools to weaken India’s security architecture, and cyber operations now represent its newest frontier. > Given that India has one of the most advanced IT ecosystems and that private Indian cybersecurity companies have been able to track cyberattacks — particularly those targeting defence technology, finance, and telecommunications — more swiftly, there is a need for greater synergy between private and government agencies. By targeting BOSS Linux, an indigenous operating system central to India’s drive for technological self-reliance, Pakistan-linked actors are staging an attack on India’s digital sovereignty. Beyond espionage, such operations enable adversaries to penetrate government systems on a large scale, intercepting sensitive policy, defence, and diplomatic communications that could influence decision-making during crises. In times of tension or limited conflict, pre-positioned malware could be activated to paralyse communication channels, interfere with logistics, or disrupt essential services, achieving strategic disruption without crossing the threshold of open war. In this sense, the targeting of BOSS Linux is symbolic of how the digital domain has become an extension of the battlefield, where state and proxy actors engage India in an unceasing contest for advantage in the grey zone. ## Defensive Priorities for India India must adopt a multi-layered, adaptive defence posture to counter the evolving threat landscape. 1. **_Mandate Indigenous Security Certification for Government Software_** **_:_** As India promotes platforms like BOSS Linux, there should be a mandatory and more rigorous security certification framework led by CERT-In, DRDO, and the National Informatics Centre (NIC). All open-source or indigenous software adopted by the government must undergo regular red-teaming, vulnerability audits, and penetration testing, with the results feeding into an early-warning repository. 2. **_Promote Public–Private Collaboration for Threat Intelligence Sharing_** **_:_** Given that India has one of the most advanced IT ecosystems and that private Indian cybersecurity companies have been able to track cyberattacks — particularly those targeting defence technology, finance, and telecommunications — more swiftly, there is a need for greater synergy between private and government agencies. Creating a secure national platform for the real-time exchange of threat data between government and industry would enhance situational awareness and facilitate early mitigation. 3. **_Create a ‘Trusted Digital Ecosystem’ Policy_** **_:_** Taking forward the country’s ‘Make in India’ mission, agencies overseeing the cybersecurity industry should promote a secure supply chain for hardware and software used in critical infrastructure. This includes regulating the import of networking equipment, mandating transparency in source code for government procurement, incentivising local cybersecurity start-ups, overcoming obstacles like No Cost, No Commitment (NCNC), and ensuring the start-ups do not migrate to Western countries. 4. **_Institutionalise Continuous Training and Capacity Building_** **_:_** A national programme for “Cybersecurity Literacy and Leadership” should be created for civil servants, military officers, and policymakers. 5. **_Develop a Strategic Cyber Deterrence Doctrine_** **_:_** India should articulate a formal doctrine defining how cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, government systems, or defence networks would be interpreted under national security law. Establishing clear thresholds for proportional responses — whether diplomatic, economic, or cyber-retaliatory — can serve as a deterrent to persistent actors like APT36. 6. **_Establish a National Cyber Command_** **_:_** Cyber threats should be treated not merely as technical incidents but as instruments of hybrid warfare. Therefore, the government and military must upgrade the Defence Cyber Agency to a Command-level body and formulate a holistic mechanism for securing national cyberspace. ## Conclusion The exploitation of BOSS Linux by APT36 is not merely a technical episode, but a strategic signal: Pakistan’s cyber-espionage machinery is adapting to India’s countermeasures and targeting indigenous solutions once thought secure. Transparent Tribe’s evolution from Windows payloads to Linux-specific malware reveals an expanding toolkit designed to penetrate India’s technological backbone. > The government and military must upgrade the Defence Cyber Agency to a Command-level body and formulate a holistic mechanism for securing national cyberspace. Pakistan’s broader cyber ecosystem, supported by state patronage and interwoven with global hacker networks, poses a persistent threat to India’s national security. For New Delhi, the challenge is not only to neutralise these campaigns but also to reinforce trust in indigenous systems and project resilience. Cyber warfare, unlike conventional conflict, unfolds silently yet relentlessly. In this theatre, the battle is as much about perceptions of security as it is about technical breaches. India’s defensive strategy must therefore be holistic, encompassing technological, institutional, and diplomatic aspects, to ensure that its sovereignty in cyberspace remains uncompromised. **_Soumya Awasthi_** _is a Fellow with the Centre for Security, Strategy and Technology at the Observer Research Foundation._ [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/www.orfonline.org#_ftnref1) BOSS Linux is a free, Indian operating system based on Linux, created by the government to promote open-source software and offer a secure system tailored for India's needs.

    "full_text": "### BW Communities # India Faces Highest Ransomware Threat In APJ Region: CrowdStrike Report [BW Online Bureau](javascript:void(0);) Oct 21, 2025 - [\\# Ransomware](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/ransomware) - [\\# India](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/india) - [\\# Cyberattack](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/cyberattack) - [\\# Cybersecurity](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/cybersecurity) - [\\# APJ](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/apj) Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years.

Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

Due to its geographical location, seismic risk zone and intertropical convergence point, the Indian subcontinent also faces recurring atmospheric phenomena: heavy monsoon rains, floods, episodes of high heat, drought, etc. In addition, the high population density in risk areas further aggravates the situation. The number of human casualties continues to rise, from 1 674 deaths in 2015 to 2 045 in 2019. According to the report of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the total number of people who died between 2 000 and 2 019 is 79 732. During the same period, India had reported 321 catastrophic events. It is the third country in the world in terms of the number of [natural disasters](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/natural-disasters-in-2021), behind China and the United States. According to the same report, India has suffered nearly 80 billion USD in economic losses in 20 years. ## Breakdown of natural disasters in India per type of event and nature of losses | Natural disasters | Material loss | Human loss | | --- | --- | --- | | **Floods** | 52% | 63% | 32% | | **Hurricanes** | 30% | 19% | 32% | | **Landslides** | 10% | - | 2% | | **Earthquakes** | 5% | 10% | 33% | | **Droughts** | 3% | 5% | 1% | | Total | 100% | 100% | 100% | **Source :** World Bank Some of the most frequent disasters include : **Floods** After China, India is the second country hardest hit by floods with no less than 17 of such events annually, affecting 345 million Indians. This scourge has caused a significant number of casualties and major economic damage to infrastructure, property, livelihoods and crops. Heavy monsoon rains in the eastern part of the country often cause the Brahmaputra River to overflow, with disastrous consequences. According to the 2019 Global Climate Risk Index report, floods account for 52% of the total calamities affecting India, claiming 63% of the material damage and 32% of the human losses reported as natural disasters. On an annual average, 7.500.000 hectares are flooded, and 1.600 lives are lost. **Earthquakes** The probability of an earthquake is high in India, with nearly 60% of the territory being classified as a moderate to severe seismic risk zone. According to seismologists, the Himalayas, one of the regions most exposed to earthquakes, should one day suffer a mega-shock caused by the pressure accumulated in the subsoil of the Himalayan arc. The last earthquake to date occurred in 2015. With a magnitude of 7.8, the earthquake killed 9 000 people and injured more than 20 000 others. More than 600 000 homes were also destroyed by the tremor. **Cyclones** Located in the intertropical convergence zone, the Indian subcontinent is one of the regions most affected by cyclones. Its coastline stretching over more than 8 000 kilometers accounts for nearly 10% of the world's tropical cyclones, the majority of which emerge over the Bay of Bengal and strike the east coast of India. On average, six to eight depressions form each year, two or three of which turn into tropical cyclones. A major cyclone (category 3 or more) develops every two years. In May 2020, [Cyclone Amphan](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/cyclone-amphan-15-billion-usd-of-economic-losses-in-south-asia), devastated India and Bangladesh, killing 84 people and devastating the coastal areas of both countries. It was the most powerful cyclone to hit the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 cyclone that killed 10 000 people in Odisha State (northeast India). **Heat waves and droughts** Extreme temperatures and resulting weather conditions significantly affect the health of residents and the agricultural sector. With global warming, these episodes of intense heat, more than 50 degrees, are becoming increasingly frequent. According to Indian authorities, in the last four years the country has reported no less than 4 620 deaths caused by heat waves which generally occur between March and June. The last event of this kind occurred in June 2019, claiming the lives of 50 people in 24 hours. Over the past 20 years, India has also sustained the two most severe droughts in the world. They took place in 2002 and 2015 and affected 300 and 330 million Indians, respectively. Despite the affordability of coverage and the intensity and frequency of natural events, the penetration rate of natural catastrophe insurance in India is almost nil, with less than 1% of the population contracting an insurance policy for this type of risk. For several years, the authorities have been planning to set up a national pool dedicated to natural disasters, a structure struggling to see the light of day. ## List of major natural disasters that have occurred over the last 20 years in India | Date | Place | Nature of the event | Economic losses | Insured losses | Number of fatalities | Number of affected persons | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | (in billion USD) | | **May 2020** | West Bengal | Hurricane Amphan | 13.5 | ND | 103 | 500 000 homeless | | **August 2018** | Kerala | Floods | 3.52 | 0.37 | 504 | 223 139 homeless | | **November 2015** | Chennai (Tamil Nadu) | Floods | 2.37 | 0.98 | 289 | -

These states also face heightened risks: - **Gujarat:** Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. - **Maharashtra:** Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. - **Tamil Nadu:** Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. ## **Earthquake Risks** - Urban centres like **Delhi** and **Ahmedabad** face significant earthquake hazards. - A major earthquake in the **Himalayas** or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** in Gujarat. ## **Challenges in Resilience and Insurance** - Despite the scale of economic losses, **underinsurance** remains a critical issue: - **Protection Gaps:** Over **90%** of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. - **Costliest Flood Events:** - **Mumbai floods (2005):** Losses of **$5.3 billion** (2024 prices) - **Chennai floods (2015):** Losses of **$6.6 billion** (2024 prices) ## **Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach** - Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: - **Hotspot Identification:** - Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. - Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. - **Risk Assessment:** - Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. - Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. - **Reinsurance Solutions:** - Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. - Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. ## **Conclusion** - India's rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. - The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. - By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. * * * ### **Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods?** Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. ### **Q2. When was NDMA constituted?** In December 2005, the Government of India enacted the Disaster Management Act, which envisaged the creation of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers. **Source :** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-economic-losses-natural-catastrophes-9779008/) * * * ​ ​ ​ Submit * * * ![logo](https://www.vajiramandravi.com/_next/static/media/badge_logo.5fb7c7f1.svg) © 2025 Vajiram & Ravi.

The most notorious civil struggle has been the conflict with Kashmir insurgents, a border conflict between India and Pakistan that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The group was inspired by the agrarian revolution ideology as a means to achieve equality. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. The Naxalites are considered far-left radical communists and are declared a terrorist group under Indian law. In this report we will look into the Maoist movement in India, starting with its history. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group’s success and the global geopolitical consequences. **[View the full report](https://www.confluenceinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/weekly_geopolitical_report_10_28_2013.pdf)** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors.

one single day during 'Operation Sindoor', hackers attacked using ... [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Oct 16, 2025, 07:44 IST Share AA + **Text Size** - Small - Medium - Large The National Stock Exchange (NSE) combats an estimated 170 million daily cyberattacks with a dedicated team and advanced systems. During 'Operation Sindoor,' the NSE successfully repelled a record 400 million attacks, demonstrating its robust defense against threats like DDoS. This highlights the critical need for constant vigilance in safeguarding financial market infrastructure. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) reportedly faces approximately 170 million cyberattacks daily, necessitating a dedicated team of \"cyber warriors\" to ensure seamless operations. \"Every day, millions of cyberattacks target the NSE, but our technical teams, supported by advanced systems and specialized software, combat these threats round the clock,\" a senior NSE official told PTI. The official noted that the exchange encounters 150 to 170 million cyberattacks daily, posing a significant challenge for its teams and systems.Recently, a group of journalists from Jammu and Kashmir visited the NSE to observe its management facilities, cyber defense centers, and backup systems. The NSE’s twin cyber defense centers operate in constant battle mode, equipped with upgraded software to neutralize and repel large-scale attacks on the financial market infrastructure 24/7, year-round. \"The robust cybersecurity architecture, combining tech-savvy personnel, machines, and technology, ensures the safety of NSE’s operations,\" the official told PTI.To bolster security, the NSE mandates Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) for all trading members and staff to maintain system integrity. ## How NSE fought highest-ever cyberattacks during 'Operation Sindoor' During 'Operation Sindoor,' a DDoS simulation, the NSE recorded an unprecedented 400 million cyberattacks in a single day, the highest ever. Despite this, attackers failed to cause damage due to the coordinated efforts of personnel, machines, and advanced technology. A DDoS attack floods a server with traffic from multiple sources, aiming to crash or make it unavailable to legitimate users, a critical threat to industries like the stock market that rely on uninterrupted operations. As a precaution during this period, the NSE temporarily restricted access to its website for foreign users.Maharashtra Cyber had identified seven Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups responsible for launching over 15 lakh cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure websites across India following the Pahalgam terror strike in April this year. Of these, only 150 attacks were reportedly successful. This means a failure rate of 99.99% or should one say abysmal success rate of 0.01%. The methods used by hackers included malware campaigns, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and GPS spoofing. The defacement of Indian websites was also reported. ## What has made cyber attacks more dangerous The NSE leadership said that a breach could impact not only the exchange’s systems but also \"whatever is connected to us,\" highlighting the ripple effect of digital vulnerabilities across interconnected networks. Officials said that growing global interconnectedness and system complexity have heightened the risk of large-scale cyberattacks, posing a significant threat to financial market stability. They further noted that the potential for low-cost, large-scale cyberattacks on financial market infrastructure remains a major global risk. **About the Author** [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) The TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The incident occurred at a reactor in the Bateias substation operated by Eletrobras, which is part of a 500-kilovolt (kV) high-voltage transmission line. The fire caused the shutdown of about 10 gigawatts (GW) of power. While some regions experienced only brief outages, others were left without electricity for over two hours. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met with Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira at the presidential palace just hours after returning from an overseas trip to discuss the incident. The blackout activated the Regional Load Relief Scheme (ERAC), a safety protocol that automatically disconnects parts of the system to prevent broader damage. Authorities downplayed the event and rejected the notion of a systemic crisis. Mr. Silveira called it a one-off infrastructure issue, saying Brazil’s national grid operator, ONS, responded promptly. - [Generation mismatch puts Brazil at risk of blackout](https://valorinternational.globo.com/economy/news/2025/09/22/generation-mismatch-puts-brazil-at-risk-of-blackout.ghtml) - [BNDES to review debt standstill requests from energy companies](https://valorinternational.globo.com/business/news/2025/10/14/bndes-to-review-debt-standstill-requests-from-energy-companies.ghtml) ONS said the fire severed the connection between the southern grid and the Southeast and Central-West regions, prompting a preventive supply cut across the country in varying degrees. The Ministry of Mines and Energy classified the incident as a “severe contingency.” In a statement, ONS said it began a coordinated response to restore power as soon as the situation was identified. Electricity was reestablished in the North, Northeast, Southeast, and Central-West regions within 90 minutes. Full restoration in the South took about two and a half hours. ONS Director-General Marcio Rea said in the statement that the agency quickly reestablished the system, “demonstrating the robustness of the National Interconnected System (SIN).” He described the event as a controlled power interruption caused by a “fortuitous incident,” the type of failure that could happen in any country. Eletrobras said the shutdown was triggered by a “reactor incident” and that power was restored shortly after. “ONS will determine what led to the larger disturbance in the national system. Eletrobras will collaborate in identifying the causes,” the company said. **System resilience** While experts acknowledged the system’s general robustness, the scale of the outage raised concerns. Luiz Carlos Ciocchi, former ONS director-general, said the blackout was “very different” from a 2023 incident that did not involve a fire. “The first question that needs answering is what exactly happened at the substation and why a fire in one component shut down an entire plant,” he said. Mr. Ciocchi added that the automatic protection scheme worked as intended, but further analysis was needed. “System security must always be a top priority in the power sector,” he said. He noted that the fire happened during low consumption hours and in a region without high renewable output. “The key is understanding what went wrong.” Power systems engineer Celso Torino pointed out that the 10GW outage was almost equivalent to power plant Itaipu’s capacity of 14 GW. “We need to better understand why a reactor fire at a 500kV substation caused the complete shutdown of 750kV lines connecting Itaipu’s 60-hertz output to Southeast Brazil,” said Mr. Torino, a former Itaipu operations director. “The N-1 security criterion tells us this shouldn’t happen.” He referred to the N-1 standard, which requires the grid to withstand the loss of a key component without triggering cascading failures. Mr. Torino said the episode calls for a broader governance review of the national grid, including planning, operational stability, and consumer cost structures. Carlos Adolfo Pereira, who heads the transmission division at the Brazilian Infrastructure and Basic Industry Association (ABDIB), said it was too soon to conclude there was a substation failure and a more detailed assessment was needed. He noted that the industry has been investing in modernizing transmission systems, especially replacing outdated equipment. “Transmission companies are expected to invest about R$40 billion through 2034 to upgrade old infrastructure,” he said. **“Reliability issue”** Edvaldo Santana, former director at energy regulator ANEEL and a columnist for Valor, said the blackout was one of the most significant in recent memory. The August 2023 outage cut 22.5GW of supply, while a 2010 failure involving Itaipu lines knocked out about 11GW. Mr. Santana questioned how a fire in a single reactor—typically considered a minor contingency—could affect the entire country, especially during low demand at around 12:30 a.m. “Even for a critical substation, a reactor fire should have been contained locally. This is a serious reliability issue,” he said. Industry sources described the Bateias substation as strategically important, part of a high-capacity 500kV line, but said it should have withstood the failure. The widespread impact indicates the system is “sensitive” to minor incidents, they said. Experts warned the event reinforces a troubling conclusion: Brazil’s grid remains “on a knife’s edge,” not due to energy shortages but because of a combination of structural weaknesses. These include fragile transmission infrastructure, equipment failures, excessive daytime solar generation followed by steep nighttime demand ramps, and networks that remain ill-equipped for extreme weather events. **Repeat of a known pattern** The event echoed a familiar pattern seen since the August 15, 2023 blackout. An ONS report blamed that outage on voltage control failures in wind and solar farms. Since then, the operator has adopted a more conservative management approach. Still, Brazil has experienced at least five major blackouts since then. Even minor incidents have had an impact. In August last year, a short circuit at an Eletrobras substation caused by a stray kite left 942,000 households without power in São Paulo and Guarulhos. Heavy rains also knocked down transmission lines and damaged dams in Rio Grande do Sul, while storms cut power to millions in the São Paulo metro area. In both cases, authorities struggled to respond quickly, leaving consumers in the dark for days. Specialists advocate for capacity auctions and technologies such as batteries and reversible power plants to improve grid resilience. “Until 2021, utilities invested R$18 billion a year. By 2025, that number will rise to R$46 billion. From 2025 to 2029, we expect R$235 billion in total investments, with 40% focused on modernizing networks,” said Ricardo Brandão, executive director for regulation at the Brazilian Association of Electricity Distributors (ABRADEE). The blackout comes just as Brazil prepares to transition from the dry season to the rainy period, which starts in November. There is still uncertainty over rainfall patterns and the recovery of hydropower reservoirs. Operational challenges are compounded by the rapid growth of renewables and pricing distortions that create additional costs for consumers and threaten the sector’s balance. Brazil narrowly avoided two national blackouts this year, one in April and another on Father’s Day, August 10. With low daytime demand, rooftop and small-scale solar generation surged to record levels, forcing ONS to disconnect large wind and solar parks to avoid overloads. Such incidents occur when the grid lacks infrastructure to carry excess generation, or when supply outpaces demand.

Villages have also faced attacks by [Meitei militias using automatic weapons and mortars](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/violence-continues-in-manipur-mortars-and-automatic-weapons-used/article67253119.ece).

This unrest has been intensive and systematic over the last 12 months and by October 2023 more than 70,000 people (including 12,000 children) had been displaced. It has been heightened by [periodic internet bans](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/manipur-violence-internet-services-restored-border-areas-exception-meiteis-kukis-2471548-2023-12-04) and the use of fake news by Meitei media groups, as well as utilising large [protest](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/12/when-peaceful-protesters-face-harsher-sentences-than-violent-racists-something-has-to-give/) mobs to demand the removal of non-Meitei public officials.

Related to these phenomena is the continued religious persecution of the Christian-majority Zo by the Hindu-majority Meitei, which has included [the burning of 357 churches](https://www.opendoors.org.au/frontline-faith/understanding-manipur-what-led-to-the-recent-violence-against-christians-in-india/) since May. Evidence has also surfaced of Zo graves being desecrated. Such claims come despite the existence of regional [Meitei drug gangs](https://thewire.in/security/manipur-violence-poppy-national-security-golden-triangle) and the increased interception by Indian security forces of armed Meitei militia members infiltrating India across the Myanmar border. This discrimination has raised fears that the communal violence aims to force non-Meitei tribals from their land, in order [to monopolise oil, gas and mineral reserves](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/at-the-core-of-manipurs-ethnic-strife-is-fight-over-tribal-land-rights) (such as uranium and platinum). The normalization of violence and population displacement accentuates such a threat. State complicity also plays a role, with Meitei leaders having linkages to big mining corporations eager to exploit such valuable natural commodities. In some areas, power supplies to non-Meitei villages have been sabotaged, leaving them without power or telecommunications for days. Elsewhere, non-Meitei villages have been blockaded by militias, preventing the delivery of essential food and commodities. Signalling a further escalation, in January 2024, [the central Manipur government conceded security control of Imphal to the Arambai Tenggol](https://thediplomat.com/2024/01/abject-surrender-of-the-state-to-armed-militia-in-indias-manipur/). This gave the Meitei militia dominance over security arrangements in Manipur’s capital and – given the militia’s ongoing violence – is an ugly portent for the local non-Meitei population. Meitei legislators were reportedly forced to declare allegiance to the Arambai Tenggol. In the months since the Arambai Tenggol took over, Imphal has seen a rise in armed intimidation, extortion, the illegal occupation of property, and even the [use of improvised explosive devices](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/one-dead-one-injured-blast-indias-manipur-state-2024-02-24/), or IEDs.

Other groups are also recasting the anniversary of the day that Manipur joined the Indian Union on 21 September 1949 as now being a “Black Day” of protest. Additional groups have protested calling for an end to gender-based violence and violence against students. Further collectives are demanding the setting up of an independent Zo administration in Manipur. Coupled with these movements are increasing calls for the Zo areas of Manipur to merge with those in the neighbouring state of Mizoram, especially given the ongoing displacement of the Zo. Within this context, the response by the central government in New Delhi continues to be seen as lax and insufficient. Although the troubles in Manipur are receiving greater national coverage, [Prime Minister Narendra Modi has resisted calls to visit the region](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/indian-opposition-walks-out-as-narendra-modi-refuses-to-discuss-manipur-conflict). This comes despite the severe economic and social damage being wrought upon its people, as well as the slow Meitei domination of Manipur’s state bureaucracies. The 2024 [general election](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/08/28/stark-figures-reveal-how-many-londoners-were-turned-away-due-to-voter-id-in-general-election/) may be a factor here, with the BJP seeking to hold the [Inner Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency) (that includes the regional capital Imphal) and possibly gain the [Outer Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency), which it lost to the Naga People’s Front by 73,782 votes in 2019. Moreover, such a blind eye can also potentially be explained by the BJP’s deeper aim to actively assimilate all India’s minorities towards its Hindu majoritarian outlook. Escalating Meitei-instigated violence against Manipur’s tribal groups certainly – and usefully – fits with such a dynamic and appears to be increasingly successful. It also strengthens narratives of India’s Hindu population being threatened by non-Hindus. A BJP victory in the 2024 national [elections](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/) will only hasten such a forced “harmonisation”, with negative consequences for other non-Hindu groups, regions, and states across India. * * * ##### Written by [Chris Ogden](https://bylinetimes.com/author/chrisogden/) * * * ##### This article was filed under [Christianity](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/christianity/), [Democracy](https://bylinetimes.com/category/democracy/), [Hinduism](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/hinduism/), [India](https://bylinetimes.com/category/foreign-affairs/india-foreign-affairs/)",

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

    "title": "CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report Highlights",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "# CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report: A New Era of Threats Emerges ## CrowdStrike Intelligence observes a thriving Chinese-language underground ecosystem and the rise of AI-developed ransomware operations. October 20, 2025 \\| [Counter Adversary Operations](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/author.counter-adversary-operations/) \\| [Threat Hunting & Intel](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/category.counter-adversary-operations/) The eCrime threat landscape in the Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) region is quickly evolving, driven by a mix of regional and global adversaries. From Chinese-language underground marketplaces facilitating the sale of stolen data and illicit services, to a rise in AI-developed ransomware campaigns, threat actors across the region are seeking new ways to scale and accelerate their operations. The CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report provides a definitive view of these threats, based on frontline intelligence from CrowdStrike’s elite threat hunters and intelligence analysts. The report combines analysis of adversary tradecraft, underground economies, and monetization trends with observations from CrowdStrike analysts who track malicious activity. In a rapidly changing threat landscape, the CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report provides the clarity and context organizations need to anticipate attacks, strengthen their defenses, and outpace the eCrime adversaries targeting their operations. **Learn more:** Download the [CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/resources/reports/2025-apj-ecrime-landscape-report/) ## Tools and Techniques Fueling eCrime Operations Highly active Chinese-language underground marketplaces are core to eCrime operations across the APJ region, despite the Chinese government’s internet restrictions and eCrime crackdown. This ecosystem provides Chinese-speaking threat actors — many of whom have prioritized operational security in light of government control — with an anonymous place to buy and sell stolen data, phishing kits, malware, and money laundering services. The most prominent Chinese-language marketplaces, which include Chang’an, FreeCity, and Huione Guarantee, enable cybercriminals to operate anonymously through clearnet, darknet, and Telegram channels. Huione Guarantee, which built a reputation for transparency and trustworthiness among eCrime actors, facilitated an estimated $27 billion USD in transactions over its lifespan. eCrime adversaries operated with a strong focus on high-value targets. India, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore were the most affected countries; manufacturing, technology, industrials and engineering, financial services, and professional services were the most affected sectors. Between January 2024 and April 2025, 763 APJ-based victims were named on ransomware and data theft and extortion dedicated leak sites (DLSs). CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the rise of AI-developed ransomware across the region. _KillSec_ and _FunkLocker_, both ransomware-as-a-service providers, named a disproportionate number of APJ-based victims on their DLSs, comprising 35% and 32% of their total victims, respectively. Of these victims, most were based in India (21% for _FunkLocker_; 33% for _KillSec_). eCrime service providers support APJ activity by supplying the tools, infrastructure, and support cybercriminals need to scale phishing, malware distribution, and monetization operations. The report examines CDNCLOUD (bulletproof hosting), Graves International SMS (global SMS spam service), and _Magical Cat_ (phishing-as-a-service). In terms of tools used, CrowdStrike Intelligence has identified likely Chinese-speaking eCrime actors using remote access tools (RATs) to target Chinese and Japanese speakers. _ChangemeRAT_, _ElseRAT_, and _WhiteFoxRAT_ were among the tools deployed through SEO poisoning, malvertising, and phishing attacks disguised as purchase orders. ## Meet the SPIDERs Operating in APJ CrowdStrike tracks several eCrime adversaries targeting the region and four active eCrime adversaries based in the region, all tracked under the SPIDER moniker. These include: - **CHARIOT SPIDER**: Vietnam-based adversary that has compromised Microsoft IIS and Adobe ColdFusion web servers - **RADIANT SPIDER**: Chinese adversary that uses formjacking to harvest payment card data - **SINFUL SPIDER**: Chinese adversary that uses password spraying and vulnerability exploitation in internet-facing applications - **SOLAR SPIDER**: Targets banking and foreign exchanges using finance-themed phishing Apart from SOLAR SPIDER, these adversaries are primarily opportunistic and have not been observed concertedly targeting the region. While CrowdStrike Intelligence has not seen APJ eCrime actors explicitly prohibit regional targeting, Chinese-speaking marketplaces’ rules and emphasis on anonymity indicate they hope to avoid law enforcement attention. Organizations in the region should prioritize defending against these adversaries by focusing on their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), while strengthening identity protections, securing cloud and SaaS environments, and preparing for ransomware and social engineering threats.

    "full_text": "FILE - A bus drives in downtown Madrid during a major power outage, Monday, April 28, 2025. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez, File) ENTSO-E’s factual report presents a second-by-second account of the ‘whats’ of the 28 April 2025 power system blackout of the Iberian Peninsula, however the ‘whys’ still remain unknown. This [unprecedented event](https://www.enlit.world/smart-grids/grid-management-monitoring/spain-and-portugal-hit-by-massive-power-outage/), the most severe blackout incident in the European power system in over 20 years, also affected a small area of France near the Spanish border for a limited duration and had major repercussions for citizens and society in Portugal and Spain. Drawing on data from the country’s TSOs, DSOs and other significant grid users including generators, ENTSO-E through its expert panel has now compiled the most comprehensive account of the event. Broadly attributed to a cascading series of generation disconnections along with voltage increases over a period of less than 90 seconds, the reasons for some of these are not known and detailed analysis is now under way for a final report, including recommendations to help prevent similar incidents in the future, in early 2026. ## When it started The starting point of the incident from the report’s point of view is 12:32:00 (CEST) on 28 April, at which time the voltage of Iberian power system at the 400kV level was below 420kV and no notable oscillation with amplitude higher than 20mHz could have been observed. From that time onwards, several important generation trips occurred. Between 12:32:00.000 and 12:32:57.000, there was a loss of 208MW identified distributed wind and solar generators in northern and southern Spain, as well as an increase in net load in the distribution grids of approxi­mately 317MW, either due to the disconnection of small embedded generators <1 MW (mainly rooftop PV) or to an actual increase in load or to a combination of both. The reasons for these events are not known. _The Northeast faces distinct challenges, including transportation electrification, aging infrastructure, renewable integration, grid modernization, and increasingly severe weather. [DTECH® Northeast](https://www.xpressreg.net/register/DTEC1125/landing.asp?sc=DNEFTWEB?utm_source=renewableenergyworld.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=articlefeature) will assemble leading stakeholders to tackle these issues head-on, offering insights into cutting-edge technologies and strategies that ensure reliability, sustainability, and customer satisfaction. Join us in Boston, Massachusetts, from November 17-19, 2025!_ [**Register now**](https://www.xpressreg.net/register/DTEC1125/landing.asp?sc=DNEFTWEB?utm_source=renewableenergyworld.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=articlefeature) The next phase of major disconnection events started some milliseconds after 12:32:57 with the tripping of a generation transformer in the region of Granada due to the activation of an over-voltage protection in the 220kV side of a 400/220kV transformer connecting several renewable generation facilities to the transmission grid. This was followed by two sets of trips at 12:33:16.460 and 12:33:16.820, the reasons for which are not known, resulting in an additional loss of around 725MW of PV and thermo-solar facilities connected to two 400 kV transmission substations in the area of Badajoz. After that, several trips between 12:33:17 and 12:33:18.020 occurred that led to disconnection of wind and solar generation in Segovia, Huelva, Badajoz, Sevilla and Caceres for a total of approximately 930MW – some due to over-voltage protection, but most not known. As some generation units were consuming reactive power with the effect of reducing the voltage, the disconnections of these units without adequate compen­sation of loss of reactive power by other resources in the system with the capability to inject/absorb reactive power meant that voltages in the system increased, not only in Spain but also in Portugal. Furthermore, the frequency decreased. Up until then, no generation trips had been observed in Portugal or France. However, between 12:33:18 and 12:33:21, the voltage of the south area of Spain sharply increased, and consequently also in Portugal, triggering a cascade of generation losses that caused the frequency of the Spanish and Portuguese power system to decline. At 12:33:19, the power systems of Spain and Portugal started losing synchronism with the rest of the European system and despite the activation of the automatic load shedding and system defence plans at 12:33:23.960, the electrical separation of the Iberian system was completed with the tripping of the AC interconnections to Morocco and France. ENTSO-E’s 45-person panel that prepared the report was led by Klaus Kaschnitz of APG in Austria and Richard Balog from MAVIR in Hungary, experts from TSOs not directly affected by the incident. Also included were panelists from both affected and non-affected TSOs, including Red Electrica from Spain, Portugal’s REN and RTE from France. _Originally published by Jonathan Spencer Jones in [Smart Energy International](https://www.smart-energy.com/industry-sectors/energy-grid-management/report-reveals-timeline-of-iberia-blackout-catastrophe/)._ [DTECH](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/tag/dtech/) [News](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/news/) [Power Grid](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/power-grid/) [Transmission](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/power-grid/transmission/) [Reliability and Resilience](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/tag/reliability-and-resilience/) ## Recommended For You ### [DOE directs FERC to ‘rapidly accelerate’ large load, data center interconnection](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/energy-business/policy-and-regulation/doe-directs-ferc-to-rapidly-accelerate-large-load-data-center-interconnection/?article_rel_content_referrer=latest) [Read Now](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/energy-business/policy-and-regulation/doe-directs-ferc-to-rapidly-accelerate-large-load-data-center-interconnection/?article_rel_content_referrer=latest) ### [Why are Democrats suddenly downplaying climate change? – This Week in Cleantech](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/podcasts/why-are-democrats-suddenly-downplaying-climate-change-this-week-in-cleantech/?article_rel_content_referrer=latest) [Read Now](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/podcasts/why-are-democrats-suddenly-downplaying-climate-change-this-week-in-cleantech/?article_rel_content_referrer=latest) ### [Northern Virginia farm tests if solar and agriculture can live in harmony](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/solar/northern-virginia-farm-tests-if-solar-and-agriculture-can-live-in-harmony/?article_rel_content_referrer=latest) [Read Now](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/solar/northern-virginia-farm-tests-if-solar-and-agriculture-can-live-in-harmony/?article_rel_content_referrer=latest) ## Must View ### [Why are Democrats suddenly downplaying climate change? – This Week in Cleantech](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/podcasts/why-are-democrats-suddenly-downplaying-climate-change-this-week-in-cleantech/) In this edition of This Week in Cleantech, Kate Yoder from Grist discusses how Democrats are downplaying the term “climate change” after the 2024 election, following polling that shows voters prioritize affordability and health care over environmental issues.

    "full_text": "The near-term threat of severe escalation between India and Pakistan has waned, but ceasefire violations remain possible and, over the long term, disagreements on water-sharing and third-party mediation in Kashmir will sustain tensions and the risk of cross-border flare-ups. Late on May 12, India and Pakistan's directors general of military operations spoke by phone, days after India and Pakistan on May 10 agreed to a ceasefire after coming close to full-blown conflict. The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about. However, the announcement came just hours after cross-border attacks had sharply escalated, with India reportedly striking several Pakistani airbases, including one near Islamabad, to which Pakistan responded by reportedly hitting two...",

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

Following the ceasefire, India and Pakistan's military leaders held a phone call on May 12 to discuss de-escalation.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

[Manish Singh](https://substack.com/@refsrc) Oct 07, 2025 22 [1](https://indiadispatch.com/p/india-grid-cannot-keep-up-with-its-ambitions/comments) 3 [Share](javascript:void(0)) India’s economic expansion and accelerating digitalisation are creating a surge in electricity demand that is exposing deep vulnerabilities in the existing power grid. The South Asian nation has committed to 500 gigawatts of non-fossil capacity by 2030, but the grid cannot yet reliably deliver clean power when and where it is needed. Supply will have to grow faster, be firmer and be more flexible than the system has ever delivered. If India captures a larger share of global data center investment driven by AI, this challenge will arrive precisely when the grid is least equipped to handle it. Goldman Sachs estimates that power required from utilities now needs roughly 7.2% annual growth between fiscal years 2025 and 2035, up from a prior 5.6%. The ratio of power growth to economic growth has been revised to roughly 1.06, versus roughly 0.85 before. Rising appliance ownership, electric vehicle charging and green-hydrogen pilots are pushing demand higher across the economy. The compute infrastructure supporting the digital economy is migrating from traditional IT rooms to industrial-scale data centres, creating a new and concentrated source of load that operates on a different scale than anything the grid has handled before. Hyperscalers say power is the first or second question in every investment decision when they evaluate potential data center locations. India’s data-centre base is still in the low single-gigawatts today, but Bernstein forecasts cluster around 5 to 6 gigawatts by 2030, provided interconnects and land clear on time. Jefferies’ top-end view reaches roughly 8 gigawatts, which at typical costs of 4 to 5 million dollars per megawatt implies 32 to 40 billion dollars of capital expenditure by decade-end. AI servers draw five to seven times the power of a legacy server rack, according to HSBC, creating disproportionate pressure on the grid. At scale, a 1 gigawatt campus needs roughly 1.3 to 1.5 gigawatts of constant supply depending on how efficiently the facility uses power, per Morgan Stanley. Power availability and connection queues now drive site selection as much as land price does, fundamentally altering the economics of where these facilities can be built. Data centres use only a sliver of India’s power today, but their share plausibly rises into the low single digits by fiscal year 2030 even in Nomura’s base case scenario. In a more aggressive scenario, consumption reaches 80 terawatt-hours, creating demand that would rival entire industrial sectors. Silicon wants electrons on a firm schedule that the current grid cannot reliably provide. India can construct utility-scale solar farms in 12 to 24 months (Mohit Bhargava, Senior Advisor to India Energy and Climate Center at UC Berkeley and former CEO of NTPC Green Energy said at a recent conference), which makes the renewable buildout look deceptively simple on paper. Reconciling that speed with the physics of electricity demand is proving harder in practice. Solar panels flood the grid when daytime demand is comparatively low, then fade precisely as households and commercial loads climb after 5 PM. On Goldman’s full-year models, the system runs a 1% to 4% energy deficit by fiscal years 2034 through 2035. Five-minute modelling of the peak week under adverse weather produces a deficit nearer 9%. This is not a morality tale about dirty versus clean energy sources but a timing problem that no amount of solar capacity alone can solve, no matter how many panels are installed or how quickly they are brought online. Coal plants can run around the clock and can ramp up production during the evening hours to meet surging demand. Legacy flexibility in the existing fleet complicates this seemingly straightforward solution in ways that limit how much solar the grid can absorb. Many Indian units struggle to operate at levels much below 60% to 70% of capacity, according to data shared by federal grid operator POSOCO. Operating at these minimum levels is crucial to keep the grid’s frequency stable, yet this makes it harder to absorb midday solar or respond to clouds passing overhead. Flexibility retrofits and revised operating norms matter as much as new megawatts in addressing this constraint, but the scale of the upgrades required is substantial. Assessments suggest India may need roughly 140 gigawatts of additional coal capacity by fiscal year 2035 versus 2023 levels. The government’s current target is roughly 87 gigawatts by fiscal year 2032. Some of this coal is bridge capacity to stabilise a faster-greening grid, not a repudiation of renewables, but the scale required exceeds what policymakers have publicly acknowledged or what most analysts expected even two years ago. Transmission infrastructure is the rate-limiter on the entire system, constraining how quickly renewable capacity can be added even when the generation itself can be built rapidly. The National Electricity Plan allocates about $110 billion for transmission through 2032, expanding the network from roughly 485,000 to roughly 648,000 circuit-kilometres and adding nine long-haul high-voltage direct current links totalling roughly 33 gigawatts. Typical interstate lines take 30 to 36 months to complete, and that timeline arrives before accounting for right-of-way fights and land acquisition disputes that routinely add years to the process. India’s present ability to move power through the system at high voltages is nowhere near what a continent-scale renewables-plus-data-centre system needs to function efficiently. Moving bulk power efficiently across regions will demand more substations, more support for maintaining stable voltage and more high-voltage direct current backbones than are currently funded or planned. The investment exists on paper, but the physical infrastructure lags years behind where it needs to be to support the generation capacity that is either already built or under construction. The constraints are already affecting major renewable developers in concrete ways. Reliance has land banks suitable for well over 100 gigawatts of solar capacity, but the ability to connect to the grid is the choke point affecting actual deployment of these projects. Its first 690 megawatt application at Khavda, a village in Bhuj Taluka of Kutch district, was granted connection capacity only by 2030, three years later than requested and larger blocks open from 2032 onward. Data-centre developers cannot sit in a transmission queue for years waiting for grid connectivity to materialize. They will gravitate toward firm electrons and existing infrastructure, not promises of future capacity that may or may not arrive on schedule. Energy storage is attempting to fill the gap between when solar generates and when demand peaks, but the scale required is enormous. Peak-week modelling suggests India could require roughly 530 gigawatt-hours of energy storage by fiscal year 2032, with about 420 gigawatt-hours plausibly delivered by batteries on current pipelines versus roughly 240 gigawatt-hours in government guidance. Battery pack prices have fallen roughly a third over the last two years, making solar-plus-storage economically viable for shifting midday power to early evening hours and covering short peaks that were uneconomic before. At multi-hundred-gigawatt-hour scale, supply chains, financing and siting still constrain deployment speed in ways that make it difficult to build fast enough. Storage is a powerful complement to transmission and flexibility, not a replacement for either, and it cannot by itself solve the problem of evening demand. Natural gas looks like a textbook bridge fuel on paper, offering the flexibility and reliability that the system needs. Except that cost and availability work against it in practice in the Indian context. Even under prospective liquefied natural gas gluts on global markets, gas-fired generation sits higher on India’s merit order than coal because of fuel pricing dynamics that have persisted for years. Image and projection: Goldman Sachs Gas will find a role as peaking capacity and locational reliability, especially where transmission infrastructure and urban substations are running at their limits, but it will not underwrite the nation’s evening ramp at scale on current economics. The math simply does not work at the volumes required to make a meaningful difference in the overall power balance. Time-of-day tariffs, interruptible contracts for large users and automated demand response can shave the peak and reduce the need for new generation capacity if deployed aggressively. These tools should be pursued because they can deliver results faster than building new plants or transmission lines and at a fraction of the capital cost. The political economy resists change in ways that make widespread deployment difficult. Distribution company finances are fragile, tariff reform is jagged and politically contentious, and enforcing sharp evening prices on voters is rarely a career-enhancing move for state governments that depend on those votes. Without that price signal, smart loads remain a pilot program rather than a resource at scale that can materially affect the peak demand problem. Institutions will decide the pace as much as technology does, determining which solutions can be deployed and how quickly they can scale. The Central Electricity Authority and Central Electricity Regulatory Commission set operating norms that determine how low coal plants can be run, how quickly they must ramp and what flexibility investments can be recovered through tariffs. State distribution companies control connection timelines and local capital expenditure decisions that affect every project. They also ration pain through load-shedding rather than pay for upgrades that stress their balance sheets and require politically difficult tariff increases. Land acquisition and right-of-way rules for the interstate transmission system pit national priorities against local politics and immediate constituent concerns in ways that delay projects for years. Open-access permissions, banking rules, and cross-subsidy surcharges tilt corporate buyers toward captive generation solutions instead of grid-beneficial ones that would help the broader system but offer less certainty to individual companies. China’s solution to data-centre load has been a coal-plus-renewables tandem buttressed by ultra-high-voltage transmission lines that move power thousands of kilometres across the country. The country built firm capacity and a long-haul backbone first, then stacked wind and solar behind it once the grid could handle the variability. It is not clean by any measure, but it is stable and predictable in ways that enable industrial planning. Texas offers a cautionary mirror on the other end of the spectrum: a torrent of wind and solar capacity, relatively light interconnections between regions, and a price-only market that invites curtailment and volatility during extreme weather events. That system is now being partly tempered by a wave of battery installations, but the integration challenges remain significant. India cannot copy either model wholesale given its own institutional constraints and geography, but the lesson is the same everywhere. Get the transmission infrastructure and the operating rules right before promising 24-hour clean power to compute campuses that require uninterrupted supply. Most commentary fixates on long-distance transmission lines as the primary constraint limiting renewable deployment. The near-term crunch may actually be distribution infrastructure at the local level, which receives less attention but creates immediate bottlenecks. Data-centre parks and peaking plants need substations at various voltage levels, high-capacity feeders, and fault-level upgrades inside cities already operating at thermal and political limits. Who pays becomes key in determining what gets built and when: developers via hefty connection charges, or distribution companies via capital expenditure they can barely finance given their debt loads and tariff constraints. Connection queues and local reinforcement requirements may add as much delay as the interstate lines that dominate public discussion, creating a two-tier bottleneck that affects different projects in different ways. Avoiding a false binary choice is essential when considering how much coal versus everything else the system needs to manage the transition. A plausible fiscal year 2035 mix that manages the evening peak includes several components working together in ways that complement rather than substitute for each other. A large block of new coal capacity operating flexibly during the 6 PM to 11 PM hours when demand surges past what renewables can provide. An upgraded legacy fleet with lower minimum operating levels to absorb midday solar without destabilising the grid’s frequency or forcing curtailment. Hundreds of gigawatt-hours of batteries shaving intraday swings and covering the first hour of the peak before other sources take over. A modest wedge of gas for location-specific reliability and fast start capability where transmission constraints prevent coal from serving certain areas. A growing contribution from time-of-day tariffs and demand response as state politics allow and distribution companies become more financially stable. The exact shares will move with prices, weather patterns and policy choices as the decade progresses, but the direction is clear regardless of which specific path policymakers choose. India will add coal to buy time for transmission, storage and demand-side tools to catch up with the modern economy’s arrival, even as it continues building renewable capacity at record rates. The digital economy is arriving faster than the physical grid can adapt to handle its demands. Transmission lines take years to plan, approve, and construct under the best circumstances. Solar panels go dark at the worst moment for system reliability, creating precisely the gap that needs to be filled. Batteries are powerful tools but not yet cheap enough at the scale required to make evening peaks disappear entirely, despite the dramatic cost declines of recent years. Hydroelectric plants and nuclear reactors face long lead times and public resistance that delay their contribution to the grid mix, often by a decade or more from initial proposal to operation. Given these timelines, the dependence on high-carbon baseload power will rise before it falls, creating a period where emissions may increase even as renewable capacity expands. Policymakers cannot pretend otherwise or deny the contradiction between clean energy goals and near-term infrastructure realities. Thanks for reading India Dispatch! Subscribe to receive new posts.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran.

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

    "full_text": "1 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 COUNTRY UPDATE: I UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 October 2024 By Sema Hasan, Senior Policy Analyst Increasing Abuses against Religious Minorities in India Introduction Religious freedom conditions in India have continued to worsen throughout 2024, particularly in the months prior to and immediately following the country’s national elections. In addition to the enforcement of discriminatory state-level legislation and propagation of hateful rhetoric, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government made a concerted effort to implement election promises that negatively and disproportionately impacted religious minorities and their ability to practice their faith. Such promises included enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), inaugurating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and introducing a national code to replace religion-specific personal laws. Each action was justified by government officials as necessary to protect India’s “cultural [and] linguistic heritage”—a common euphemism for Hindu supremacy, often at the expense of religious minorities. This report provides an overview of the various religious freedom violations that have taken place in India during 2024. It focuses on changes to the country’s legal framework, including the strengthening of discriminatory legislation like state-level anti-conversion and anti-terrorism laws, as well as the implementation of the CAA and the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). It also examines the increasing frequency of attacks against religious minorities and their advocates, including the targeting of places of worship. Laws and Other Challenges to Religious Freedom at the National Level The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) In May 2024, the Indian government published the rules for implementing the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), fulfilling a long-anticipated BJP campaign promise. Amending the country’s 1955 Citizenship Act, the CAA established a religious criterion for fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants (from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, or Christian communities) fleeing neighboring Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The law excludes Muslim refugees, including Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka. The act states that an individual must have lived or worked in India prior to December 31, 2014, in order to apply for citizenship. www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov Stephen Schneck Chair Eric Ueland Vice Chair Commissioners Mohamed Elsanousi Maureen Ferguson Susie Gelman Vicky Hartzler Asif Mahmood Meir Soloveichik Erin D. Singshinsuk Executive Director USCIRF’s Mission To advance international freedom of religion or belief, by independently assessing and unflinchingly confronting threats to this fundamental right. 2 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Critics argue that the CAA violates the Indian constitution’s principles prohibiting religious discrimination and its guarantees of equal protection under the law. Mass protests followed the initial announcement in 2019, in which hundreds were injured and thousands arrested—some of whom remained in detention as of September 2024, including Umar Khalid, Meeran Haider, and Sharjeel Imam. The recent announcement of the implementation rules initiated a surge of new protests as well as a number of petitions challenging the CAA before the Supreme Court. Several Indian states have expressed opposition to the CAA. In 2019, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh all moved resolutions against the CAA. In February 2024, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu stressed that he would not allow implementation of the CAA in that state, as he would “stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan brethren.” Similarly, in March, the chief minister of West Bengal voiced her opposition to the act, arguing that it would be used to “turn legal citizens into foreigners.” Kerala was the first state to legally challenge the CAA and in March renewed its 2020 plea before the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the law’s classification based on religion and country is discriminatory. In June, the Madhya Pradesh government granted Indian citizenship to three applicants under the CAA. National Register of Citizens (NRC) Human rights advocates argue that the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in combination with the CAA, would allow the Indian government to expel those it deemed noncitizens, posing particular risk to the country’s Muslim population. The government first piloted the NRC in Assam in 2018, when it sought to separate Indian citizens from “undocumented immigrants” living in that state. The NRC requires residents to prove they or their ancestors had entered Assam prior to March 24, 1971, or face exclusion from the register. In 2019, the Assam government published its list of names of those it considered Indian citizens according to the NRC, omitting 1.9 million names. Of these 1.9 million, an estimated 700,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Bengali Hindus, and 200,000 were from the Assamese Hindu groups Koch-Rajbongshi, Das, Kalita, and Sarma. In July 2024, the Assam government ordered police to cease referring people entitled to Indian citizenship— under the CAA—to Foreigners’ Tribunals, which function as quasi-judicial bodies that authorities task with determining whether an individual is a “suspected foreigner.” Despite this order, police in Assam that same month, in conjunction with the Foreigners’ Tribunals, declared 28 Muslims as “non-citizens” and sent them to a deportation center. In September, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that all individuals must submit an NRC application in order to receive identity cards. New Delhi India USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 3 Expropriation and Demolition of Places of Worship and Muslim Property Since the beginning of 2024, Indian authorities have facilitated the expropriation of places of worship, including the construction of Hindu temples on the sites of mosques. Most notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in January, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Indian authorities had constructed the temple atop the ruins of the Babri Masjid, which a Hindu mob had demolished in 1992 in their belief that it marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site was long contested; India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the mosque’s destruction was an “egregious violation” of the law and yet granted the site to Hindus while offering Muslims a separate plot of land to construct a new mosque—which remains unbuilt as of September 2024. The days following the temple’s January 2024 consecration were marked by a series of attacks and other instances of intolerance against religious minorities across six states. In each instance, violence erupted following Hindu nationalist processions through predominantly Muslim neighbors. In Maharashtra, violence broke out along Mira Road, where police stood by as mobs vandalized dozens of Muslim-owned shops. Several reports indicate that the police arrested Muslim youths, despite receiving dozens of complaints against the actions of the Hindu mob. In the aftermath of the Mira Road violence, municipal authorities returned with bulldozers to demolish structures they deemed illegal. Commonly referred to as “bulldozer justice,” state authorities have repeatedly used bulldozers to demolish Muslim property under the guise of removing “illegal” structures, including homes, businesses, and places of worship. In February, for example, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the 600-year-old Akhoondji Mosque, alleging that the building was an illegal encroachment. The mosque’s imam argued that he did not receive written notice before the demolition. The DDA has also announced its intention to demolish 20 religious structures in the forested areas of Sanjay Van, including 16 Muslim shrines. A court order claimed that Delhi “already had sufficient dargahs and temples” and that the forest needed restoration. The same month, in Uttarakhand, the demolition of a mosque and Muslim seminary by police and government officials sparked deadly clashes and an internet shutdown. In July, the DDA demolished the Faizyab Mosque and Madrassa in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area. Places of Worship Act Beyond demolitions, the government has expropriated several mosques for alternative purposes, directly violating India’s Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. The 1991 act froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed in August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith. While the act does not apply to the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, it extends protection to all other places of worship. Despite this law, an Indian court ruled in February that Hindus can worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, which Hindus claim rests on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The same month, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav called for the repeal of the Places of Worship Act, calling it “unconstitutional.” Waqf Amendment Bill In addition, many Muslims have expressed concern regarding the Indian government’s introduction of the Waqf Amendment Bill in August, which seeks to repeal the 1995 Waqf Act. A waqf is an endowment (movable or immovable) that Muslims can give for a specific pious or charitable purpose, according to Islamic tradition. Once registered as a waqf, such property—which may include land, graveyards, or buildings—is deemed nontransferable and held in perpetuity as such. All mosques in India are considered waqf properties, under the management of Muslim bodies in every state, known as Waqf Boards. The 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to broaden the government’s regulatory authority over these endowments and proposes the mandatory inclusion of non-Muslim members on Waqf Boards. It also seeks to prohibit the designation of a given property as a waqf based on its owner’s oral declaration alone. Legal experts and Muslim leaders argue that these provisions would erode their community’s autonomy over its own religious institutions. The introduction of this legislation follows the increased proliferation of disinformation regarding the distribution of wealth among India’s Muslim communities, including derogatory comments that Prime Minister Modi made during the national election. 4 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 State and Local Laws Impacting Religious Minorities Uniform Civil Code and Personal Status Laws Since 2019, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have articulated their intention to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to overrule existing personal laws that are highly integrated with religious beliefs. Such personal laws include areas such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession. Critics argue that a UCC would contradict secular principles while failing to adequately represent the needs and values of the country’s myriad and diverse religious communities. In February, the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand passed a state-level UCC bill, establishing a uniform set of rules on personal status law that includes marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. This bill is widely considered to represent a template for other states to adopt. The UCC sets the minimum age for marriage at 18. While Hindu and secular laws set age restrictions for men and women, there are no such limitations for Muslims and other communities. Some Muslim communities have characterized the UCC as a threat to Islamic practices, preferring to observe Shari’a as the basis for personal law, and some Sikh organizations have similarly rejected it, arguing that it “undermines Sikh identity.” The UCC further requires “live-in” relationships to be registered within a month and establishes criminal punishments, including six months in jail, for failing to do so. Such provisions would allow for further policing of interfaith couples, who already face risks including threats of violence from family members. In July, for example, the Uttarakhand high court directed police to provide protection to an interfaith couple in a live-in relationship and instructed them to register under the UCC. The couple reported receiving threats from their parents about their relationship. Anti-Conversion Laws In addition to the UCC and other legislation, authorities frequently used state-level policies throughout the first part of 2024, including anti-conversion laws, to target religious minorities across India. As USCIRF previously reported, 12 of India’s 28 states currently maintain anti\u0002conversion laws and enforce them to varying degrees. These laws prohibit conversion under circumstances that far exceed cases of coercion, and they are often punishable by hefty fines and prison terms. Authorities frequently enforce such laws under the pretext of preventing so-called “love jihad”—a conspiracy theory that claims Muslim men target and seduce Hindu women for conversion to Islam—while in effect targeting interfaith relationships. Since the beginning of the year, authorities have arrested dozens of Christians on allegations of conducting or participating in forced conversions. In June, for example, police in Uttar Pradesh detained 13 Christians, including four pastors; in July, seven Christians faced accusations of violating the state’s anti-conversion law in two separate incidents. That same month, government officials from Uttar Pradesh tabled a bill that would strengthen the state’s anti-conversion law, including expanding the punishment for conversion to life imprisonment, allowing anyone to file a First Instance Report (FIR) against suspected violators, and making religious conversion a nonbailable offense. Several other states made similar efforts to introduce or strengthen existing anti-conversion laws. In February, for example, the state of Chhattisgarh announced it would introduce legislation to address “illegal conversion,” claiming that Christian pastors had forcibly converted Hindus. In February, the Assam government passed the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Bill, which bans individuals or groups from performing “non\u0002scientific” healing, such as prayer, to treat illnesses. The chief minister of Assam further noted his intention to restrict Christian evangelism and conversion in the state with the bill. In April, the government of Gujarat issued a circular mandating that Hindus wishing to convert to Buddhism, Sikhism, or Jainism obtain approval from their district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. In June, the BJP-led government in Rajasthan withdrew its 2008 anti-conversion law in favor of new legislation aimed at “curbing alleged cases of ‘love jihad’” and religious conversion. Additionally, as of August, appeals challenging the constitutionality of anti\u0002conversion laws were pending in seven states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Anti-Cow Slaughter Laws India’s constitution directs states to take steps to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, considered sacred in Hinduism. As a result, 20 of India’s 28 states currently enforce anti-cow slaughter laws. Vigilante groups and self-proclaimed “cow protectors” frequently exploit such laws to target religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits. USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 5 An estimated dozen attacks involving “cow vigilantism” took place following India’s national elections in June. In August, for example, a group of cow vigilantes beat a Muslim migrant worker to death, falsely accusing him of having eaten beef. A day later, a group of Hindu men violently attacked a 72-year-old Muslim man because they believed he was carrying beef in his bag. The same month, a group of “cow protectors” shot and killed a 19-year-old Hindu student because they thought he was a Muslim smuggling cows. While arrests were made in each of these cases, perpetrators of such attacks often operate with impunity; they rarely face punishment and are often released on bail within 24 hours. Other Significant Religious Freedom Challenges across India Hate Speech, Misinformation and Disinformation In the leadup to the June 2024 elections, political officials increasingly wielded hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims and other religious minorities. Prime Minister Modi repeatedly claimed that the opposition party would “wipe out [the] Hindu faith from the country” and had plans to make Hindus “second class citizens in their own country.” He perpetuated hateful stereotypes about Muslims, referring to them as “infiltrators.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah echoed these statements and insisted falsely that opposition leaders would impose Shari’a if elected—despite the fact that the opposition election manifesto included no mention of Shari’a or Muslims. Additionally, misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech by Indian government officials frequently fuel and incite cow vigilantism and other attacks against religious minorities. The attacks against Muslims in Mira Road following the inauguration of the Ram Temple in January, for example, erupted following inflammatory speeches by two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain. Rane reportedly openly threatened the Muslim community, using offensive language and urging the Hindu community to “ignite and retaliate.” While First Instance Reports (FIRs) were filed against Rane and Jain, Mumbai police argued in July that the use of terms like “jihadis,” “Rohingya,” and “Bangladeshis” were not aimed at the Muslim community and therefore did not fall under Section 295A of the penal code. The same month, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about an increase in hate speech targeting Rohingya refugees and the Indian government’s role in arbitrary mass detention and forcible return of that community to Burma. Following Rane and Jain’s speeches, BJP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) T. Raja Singh gave a 40-minute speech in February stoking religious tensions, in which he openly called for violence against Muslims and for the further demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura. Singh claimed that Muslims were facilitating the forceful conversion of Hindus and repeatedly referred to Rohingya and Bangladeshi Muslims as “illegal.” He encouraged his audience to be “prepared to fight for the protection of our country and religion” and to fight against “love jihad,” forced conversion, and cow slaughter. Attacks against Religious Minorities In March, a group of UN experts raised alarm about the level of violence and hate crimes against religious minorities in the leadup to national elections, including vigilante violence, targeted and arbitrary killings, demolition of property, and harassment. They called on the Indian government to fulfill its obligation to prohibit religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and violence. From January to March 161 incidents of violence against Christians in India were reported—47 of which occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh. Such incidents ranged from violent attacks on churches and prayer meetings to physical assaults, harassment, and false allegations of forced conversion. Muslims continued to be targeted, as well. In March, a group of Hindus in Gujarat violently attacked foreign Muslim university students as they gathered for prayer during Ramadan. The university subsequently issued new guidelines, instructing students not to pray in common spaces. Moreover, following the election results, during which the BJP lost its national majority, at least 28 attacks against Muslims occurred from June to August. Religious educational institutions were also subjected to harassment and targeting. In February, for example, Hindu organizations entered a Catholic school in Assam and demanded instructors cease using Christian images and symbols. In March, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment striking down a previous ruling on the governance of madrasas, effectively banning Islamic schools in that state and ordering the public school enrollment of students whom the closures had impacted. 6 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Crackdown on Civil Society and Faith-Based Organizations In 2024 the government of India has expanded its tactics of repression to target religious minorities and their advocates abroad. Journalists, academics, and civil society organizations documenting India’s religious freedom violations have reported facing denial of consular services, including the revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards as well as threats of violence and surveillance. In April, international reporting linked an official in India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to the 2023 assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist in New York. Additionally, Indian authorities have repeatedly used discriminatory legislation to target religious communities and those advocating on their behalf. Authorities continued to exploit antiterror and financing laws, including the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to crack down on civil society organizations, religious minorities, human rights defenders, and journalists reporting on religious freedom. The UAPA was enacted in 1967 but amended in 2019, allowing the government to designate individuals as “terrorists” without due process. The law vaguely defines “unlawful activity” as any action “intended to disrupt India’s sovereignty, integrity or security,” including “disruptive speech.” In 2024, several religious minorities and human rights activists have continued to face detention without trial under the UAPA, including Hany Babu and Rona Wilson. Academic and human rights activist GN Saibaba, whom authorities detained under the UAPA in 2017 for criticizing state violence against religious minorities, was ultimately released in March but described how police had abused him, tortured him, and denied him medical care while in custody. Similarly, organizations that document and advocate for religious freedom continue to face harassment and, in some cases, are forced to shut down operations. Like the UAPA, authorities have used India’s Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to obstruct the work of civil society organizations. FCRA regulates access to foreign funds for individuals and organizations and prohibits receipt of foreign funds for “any activities [deemed] detrimental to the national interest” of India. The law requires nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to apply for FCRA licenses to received foreign funding, but authorities can readily revoke such licenses. In April, India’s Home Ministry canceled the FCRA licenses of five NGOs, preventing them from using existing funds. Those NGOs included the Church of North India (CNI) Synodical Board of Social Service, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, and Evangelical Fellowship of India. In total, the Indian government has canceled over 20,000 FCRA registrations since 2012. Replacing India’s Criminal Code In July, the Indian government moved to replace its colonial-era criminal laws with three new laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA). These laws replaced the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1872 Indian Evidence Act, respectively. Human rights groups argue that the enforcement of these new laws may have exacerbated the targeting of religious minorities and their advocates. Such legislation may pose an additional threat to freedom of expression, association, and right to a free trial, particularly for religious minorities. The BNS specifically adds a new provision criminalizing “acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India” and increases the minimum punishment from three years to seven. It also expands the criminalization of the promotion of “enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion” to include electronic communications. Reporting indicates that this provision has already served as a pretext for targeting journalists who reported on an alleged mob lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh. The BNSS additionally allows for police to seek 15-day detention of an accused individual at any time before they have completed 40–60 days of the allowed remand period. UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief. Professional Staff Michael Ardovino Policy Analyst Susan Bishai Senior Policy Analyst Mollie Blum Policy Analyst Guillermo Cantor Director of Research and Policy Elizabeth K.

The Indian government continues to repress and restrict religious communities through the enforcement of discriminatory legislation like anti-conversion laws, cow slaughter laws, and antiterrorism laws. In doing so, authorities have arbitrarily detained individuals highlighting violations of religious freedom, including religious leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, without due process—in some cases for years. Indian officials have repeatedly employed hateful and derogatory rhetoric and misinformation to perpetuate false narratives about religious minorities, inciting widespread violence, lynchings, and demolition of places of worship. In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in particularly severe religious freedom violations. This report further outlines a number of policy recommendations that the U.S. government can take to address religious freedom violations in India, including issuing targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, conditioning arms sales based on improved religious freedom conditions, and incorporating religious freedom priorities into bilateral meetings with Indian government counterparts.",

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

Project developers allege that due to a lack of adequate transmission infrastructure to carry the electricity they generate, dozens of commissioned plants, ready to feed power into the grid, are being forced to sit idle and incur losses. “Between March and August 2025, at least 30 solar and wind plants faced curtailment, with combined losses of up to Rs 700 crore,” chief commercial officer with a renewable project told _Down To Earth_ ( _DTE_), requesting anonymity. Experts say such curtailment is shaking investor confidence and could jeopardise India’s target of installing 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based electricity capacity by 2030. The Union Ministry of Power is responsible for laying transmission lines or upgrading existing ones when approving power projects—whether coal-based or renewable. Once a plant is commissioned, it requires general network access (GNA) from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to begin transmission. However, GNA has not been issued to several newly commissioned solar and wind power plants in the high-generation states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, according to manufacturers who spoke with _DTE_ on condition of anonymity. These plants are instead granted temporary general network access (TGNA). This temporary access, usually valid for up to 11 months, allows electricity to be fed into the grid, but only when there is low supply to the lines. “During the six months till August 2025, we were instructed by the Grid Controller of India to embrace curtailments of up to 48 per cent of our daily production... _This article was originally published in the October 1-15, 2025 print edition of_ Down To Earth [To Continue Reading Subscribe Now](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/subscription) [Renewable Energy](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/renewable-energy) [Solar Energy](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/solar-energy) [Wind Energy](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/wind-energy) [electricity transmission](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/electricity-transmission) Show Comments ## Related Stories No stories found.

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India...",

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

On August 27th, the US raised the tariff on most Indian exports from 25% to 50%. According to US president Donald Trump, the additional punitive measure has been taken because of India’s imports of Russian oil (of which India is the second-largest buyer) and defence equipment at a time when Russia has frustrated Mr Trump’s attempts to end the war in Ukraine. ## Why does it matter? EIU believes that India will resist giving up inexpensive oil imports from Russia, given the need to ensure energy security without fuelling crises in inflation, the balance of payments and government subsidies. India is a major energy importer, with 80% of its crude oil needs being met by imports. Since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has supplanted other major sources of oil imports for India, such as Iraq and the US, because of price considerations. Substantial investment has also gone into upgrading Indian refineries to refine Ural-grade crude oil from Russia, which formed less than 1% of the Indian crude oil import basket prior to 2022. The punitive nature of the additional tariff suggests that it is a negotiating tactic from the US to influence the terms of ongoing bilateral trade talks with India. This is also evident in the fact that the US has not yet imposed a similar punitive measure on China, which is the largest importer of discounted Russian crude oil. Notwithstanding this pressure, energy security needs will trump other considerations for India, which will continue to favour Russian crude oil supplies, while also promising to step up energy imports from the US. There is now a risk of increased belligerence in trade talks between India and the US, which would complicate the achievement of a mutually favourable trade deal. The Indian administration has taken a hardline stance on the US government’s tariff rhetoric, in a stark contrast to the attitude struck by South-east Asian nations. India will continue to firmly oppose US access in politically sensitive areas such as agriculture (including genetically modified crops) and dairy products. Nonetheless, given the lack of will for a complete decoupling on both sides, we still believe that a bilateral trade agreement of some form will manifest in the months ahead, with complicated issues left for future discussions. If the 50% tariff on India remains in place for the rest of fiscal year 2025/26 (April-March), we believe that it will reduce GDP growth to 5.8%, from our current forecast of 6.2% (under the baseline 25% tariff rate). The higher tariffs are expected to affect over half of India’s exports destined for the US, including textiles, gems and jewellery, marine products, machinery and leather. These sectors will face lower export orders, slower hiring, limited capacity addition, lower foreign investment and poor stock index performance. Three factors will preclude a sharper slowdown in Indian growth: exemptions for certain categories (including steel, aluminium, pharmaceuticals, energy and electronics); the relatively low share of exports in India’s economy (goods exports to the US are equivalent to about 2% of India’s GDP); and recent trade diversification efforts by India. ## What next? We believe that the US will lower tariffs on Indian exports eventually, though the timeline remains highly uncertain. In the event that a trade deal is abandoned altogether, or if the US ratchets up its tariff narrative against India, the impact on GDP growth will be larger through second-round effects such as imported inflation (resulting from currency contagion), weaker corporate confidence and financial market slumps, although this will be reflected from 2026/27. This would also involve a major upheaval in India-US ties, though it is not our core forecast. ## Want to understand how regional variation shapes India’s business environment?

Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

Equity securities may fluctuate in value and can decline significantly in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions. Bonds generally present less short-term risk and volatility than stocks, but contain interest rate risk (as interest rates raise, bond prices usually fall); issuer default risk; issuer credit risk; liquidity risk; and inflation risk. These effects are usually pronounced for longer-term securities. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Currency Risk is a form of risk that arises from the change in price of one currency against another. Whenever investors or companies have assets or business operations across national borders, they face currency risk if their positions are not hedged. Generally, among asset classes, stocks are more volatile than bonds or short-term instruments. Government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate short-term price fluctuations than stocks, but provide lower potential long-term returns. U.S. Treasury Bills maintain a stable value if held to maturity, but returns are generally only slightly above the inflation rate. © 2025 State Street Corporation - All Rights Reserved.

Published October 27, 2025 **GLOBAL – [Global](https://millingmea.com/tag/global/) food markets are facing heightened volatility as weather patterns, government policies, and geopolitical tensions reshape trade flows for key commodities, according to the “Atlas of Food” report for October 2025 released by S&P Global Commodity Insights.** The report underscores that the world’s major food crops, soybeans, corn, and wheat, are increasingly influenced by both climate and policy. According to _S&P Global Commodity Insights_, government biofuel mandates in the U.S. and [Brazil](https://millingmea.com/tag/brazil/) are reshaping agricultural demand patterns by diverting oilseeds and grains into energy markets. Tariffs, quotas, and export restrictions, such as [India](https://millingmea.com/tag/india/)’s wheat export ban and [Russia](https://millingmea.com/tag/russia/)’s price floor, continue to amplify volatility in food prices. Weather variability remains the most persistent risk. The 2024–25 crop cycles saw severe droughts in Brazil, frosts in Russia, and shifting rainfall in the U.S. Corn Belt, all underscoring how climate extremes are now key price drivers across the food system. **[Soybean](https://millingmea.com/category/soybean/): Dominance of Americas** [Soybean](https://millingmea.com/tag/soya/) production is predominantly concentrated in the Americas, accounting for 80% of global output, with Brazil emerging as the leading exporter ahead of the United States. The report notes that Brazil’s double-cropping system provides a competitive edge, allowing farmers to alternate between soybeans and corn based on price ratios. Platts data indicates that soybean prices, assessed via benchmarks like SOYBEX CFR [China](https://millingmea.com/tag/china/) and FOB Santos, have been influenced by biofuel mandates in the US and Brazil, which divert soybean oil toward renewable diesel production. Trade flows are heavily skewed toward China, which purchases over half of globally traded soybeans. The Brazil-to-China route represents more than 40% of international soybean trade. However, US exports have declined by 15% since 2017-18 due to domestic crushing demands, as per [USDA](https://millingmea.com/tag/usda/) and Platts figures. Weather events, including La Niña-induced droughts in Brazil during 2021-22, have further driven volatility, with prices peaking in December 2021. Processing yields approximately 19% oil and 78% meal from soybeans, with oil increasingly valued at 45% of the crush due to biofuel demand. [Argentina](https://millingmea.com/tag/argentina/) leads in soybean oil and meal exports, while the EU is the largest meal importer. **Corn** Corn, the world’s primary feed grain, sees production concentrated in the US, China, Brazil, and Argentina, totaling over 70% of global supply. The US remains the top exporter in normal years, but Brazil overtook it in 2022-23 amid US droughts. Platts assessments for Corn CFR Northeast [Asia](https://millingmea.com/tag/asia/) and FOB US Gulf Coast show prices influenced by biofuel policies, such as US ethanol blending mandates finalized in June 2023, which created export surpluses. The report details seasonal cycles, with global supply tightening between July and September, leading to volatility. In 2024, Brazil’s output dropped 10% to 119 million mt due to droughts in Mato Grosso, but a rebound to 130 million mt is forecasted for 2024-25. Trade flows are diversified, with the US-to- [Mexico](https://millingmea.com/tag/mexico/) route comprising 13% of global trade. Distillers Dried [Grains](https://millingmea.com/tag/grains/) with Solubles ( [DDGS](https://millingmea.com/tag/ddgs/)), a corn ethanol byproduct, adds another layer, with the US dominating exports. **[Wheat](https://millingmea.com/category/wheat/): Black sea dependency** [Wheat](https://millingmea.com/tag/wheat/), essential for human consumption, is produced mainly by China and the EU, but Russia leads exports, supplying the Middle East and [Africa](https://millingmea.com/tag/africa/). Platts FOB Russian Wheat 12.5% assessments reflect the impact of Russia’s export taxes and quotas since 2021, which stabilize domestic prices but elevate global costs. The Black Sea region’s vulnerability was evident in the Russia- [Ukraine](https://millingmea.com/tag/ukraine/) war, causing prices to surge 26% within a week of the February 2022 invasion. In addition, India’s 2022 export ban, following heat waves, further exacerbated volatility. The report forecasts tight supplies between April and June annually, with [Egypt](https://millingmea.com/tag/egypt/) as a key importer reliant on subsidized bread programs. **Shifting protein markets** The _Atlas of Food_ also examines the downstream effects of feed and crop prices on the meat sector. Chicken, pork, and beef production are sensitive to feed costs, with poultry emerging as the most affordable and widely traded protein. Brazil remains the leading chicken exporter, while the U.S. and the EU dominate pork and beef respectively. However, disease outbreaks and extreme weather have repeatedly disrupted trade. Brazil’s temporary export halt in 2024 due to Newcastle disease and recent heat waves in 2025 caused significant price swings across the poultry market. Feed-related costs remain central to livestock production economics, as nearly 70% of total poultry production expenses derive from feed, mostly corn and soybean meal. The report links rising protein demand in developing economies with growing global grain use, underscoring the tight relationship between feed grains and food security. _Sign up to [HERE](https://foodbusinessafrica.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=8dacba15942964188af1f3c10&id=529878f093) receive our email newsletters with the latest news and insights from [Africa](https://millingmea.com/tag/africa/) and around the world, and follow us on our [**WhatsApp channel**](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VavIz0fHltYGqAjDqe1o) for updates._ ### Related posts: 1.
