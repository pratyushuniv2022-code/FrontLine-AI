The victim had been forcibly disappeared from the Jusak area of Turbat on April 15. On April 16, 2025, the tortured body of a Baloch youth, Farooq Ahmed, who was the younger son of Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) leader Noor Ahmed Mengal, recovered from the Nall area of Khuzdar District. Farooq Ahmed had reportedly been forcibly disappeared on April 14. Noor Ahmed Mengal is the BNP-M’s vice president in Khuzdar District. BNP-Mengal stated that Farooq’s father, Noor Ahmed Mengal, had been actively participating in the protest sit-in near Lakpass in recent days, which was held in opposition to the arrest of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) leaders. On April 15, 2025, the tortured dead body of a forcibly disappeared’ person, Nizam, son of Mohammad, who had been abducted earlier in the month from Babbar Shor, was discovered in the Pasni area of Gwadar District. On April 15, 2025, the dead body of a forcibly disappeared Baloch man, Abu Bakar, was recovered in the Buleda area of Kech District. On April 7, 2025, three bullet-riddled dead bodies of forcibly disappeared persons were recovered from the Mehma Samand Khan area of Barkhan District. The deceased were identified as Haq Nawaz Buzdar, Shero Buzdar, and Gul Zaman Buzdar, all from the Buzdar tribe. Local sources said Haq Nawaz was picked up from his home in Musakhel District on April 5, while Shero had been missing for the past nine months. On April 7, 2025, the dead body of forcibly disappeared Nadir Baloch was recovered from the Kandhari area of Mashkay in the Awaran District. Nadir Baloch, was allegedly ‘disappeared’ by SFs on April 6, and his bullet-riddled body was found dumped in a remote area a day later. On April 6, 2025, two Baloch men, Mehrab s/o Rehamdil and Khan Mohammad s/o Haibtan, were tortured to death after their alleged “enforced disappearance” from their homes in the Gardank area of Buleda _tehsil_ (revenue unit) in Kech District. On April 5, 2025, three bullet-riddled bodies of forcibly disappeared persons were recovered in Mashkay area of Awaran District. The victims were identified as Zahoor s/o Huzoor, Shah Nawaz s/o Jalal, and Habib s/o Eido. On April 17, 2025, while strongly denouncing the recent resurfacing of dead bodies of forcibly disappeared persons, the Baloch Women Forum (BWF) raised serious concerns about the resurgence of the infamous “Kill and Dump” policy in Balochistan, stating that it casts serious doubt on the State’s commitment to international human rights standards. According to a BWF spokesperson, this development only reinforces the Baloch people’s ongoing feelings of exclusion from the federation. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), based on open media sources, at least 13 bullet-riddled bodies have recovered in Balochistan during the first 18 days of April (data till April 20, 2025). According to a report by _Paank_, the human rights wing of the Baloch National Movement (BNM), 12 extra-judicial killings were reported across Balochistan in March. Similarly, _Paank_ reported 18 extra-judicial killings in February, and eight in January. With 51 extra-judicial killings, the cumulative figure of extra-judicial killings till April 20 in the current year is already approaching the total number of extra-judicial killing in the entirety of the previous year, at 68 cases. 75 persons were extra-judicially killed in 2023, and 195 in 2022. Extra-judicial killings are the final stage of the State’s systematic human rights abuses, which start with abduction or arbitrary arrest, followed by torture. According to the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), Balochistan has around 7,000 missing persons. However, the Pakistan Government’s Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (COIED) report claimed that there were only 454 active cases in Balochistan, as of October 2023, an assertion that created deep resentment among the Baloch people. Disappeared persons’ bodies are often dumped by the roadside, with marks of severe physical torture and riddled with bullets. This pattern of systematic abuse has been adopted by Pakistan’s security agencies and State backed ‘death squads’, to suppress the Baloch insurgency. ‘Death squads’ are locally armed militia of criminals in Balochistan who are patronized by the Army, to carry out enforced disappearances and realize the state’s ‘kill-and-dump policy’. These groups often accompany SFs during raids on the homes of political activists, dissidents and ‘pro-independence’ leaders. In exchange for their services, the SFs have given the death squads a free hand to operate throughout Balochistan, to engage in a range of illegal activities, including drug dealing, smuggling of weapons, and to run terrorist training camps and private jails, under the patronage of the intelligence agencies. Apart from Islamist and sectarian extremism-related fatalities in the province, the ‘death squads’ alnd SFs have been the main executors of unattributed extrajudicial killings in Balochistan. According to the SATP database, of the 5,073 conflict-linked civilian fatalities recorded in Balochistan since 2004 (data till April 20, 2025), at least 1,665 are attributable to one or other terrorist/insurgent outfit. Of these, 654 civilian killings (363 in the South and 291 in the North) have been claimed by Baloch separatist formations, while Islamist and sectarian extremist formations – primarily Islamic State, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi ( **[LeJ](https://satp.org/terrorist-profile/pakistan/tehreek-e-taliban-pakistan-ttp)**), Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( **[TTP](https://satp.org/terrorist-profile/pakistan/tehreek-e-taliban-pakistan-ttp)**) and Ahrar-ul-Hind (Liberators of India) – claimed responsibility for another 1,011 civilian killings, 928 in the North (mostly in and around Quetta) and 83 in the South. The remaining 3,408 civilian fatalities – 1,920 in the South and 1,488 in the North – remain 'unattributed', and are largely believed to have been the handiwork of the SFs and their death squad proxies. Shafiq-ur-Rehman Mengal formed the first death squad in Balochistan in 2008 – the Musallah Defah Tanzeem (MDT) – with the purported mission of ‘defending’ the public from pro-independence groups. Mengal had the support of the Pakistan Army, and his powerful connections helped him raise his militia. Mengal initiated a reign of terror in Balochistan, killing not only suspected nationalists but also political, non-political and tribal rivals. Mengal is also ‘credited’ with the mass graves discovered in 2014 in Tootak, a rural area 55 kilometres to the north of Khuzdar, where 169 bodies were recovered. Several other local militia groups in Balochistan were raised as death squads, including the Zakaria M. Hasni-led death squad in Khuzdar; the Deen Muhammad Deenu-led group in Awaran; another led by Samir Sabzal, Rashid Pathan and Sardar Aziz in Kech; the Maqbool Shambezi group in Panjgur and the Siraj Raisani group in Mastung. Siraj Raisani was killed on July 13, 2018, when a suicide bomber targeted a Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) political rally, killing at least 128 people and injuring more than 200 at Dringarh village in Mastung District. An investigative report by exiled Baloch journalist Taha Siddiqui published in the _South Asia Press_ on 27 April, 2021, claimed that, since 2010, the practice of using ‘death squads’ had been intensified and institutionalized, especially in the south-western parts of Balochistan where a full-fledged insurgency has been going on since the killing of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti on August 26, 2006. Cases of disappearance are not new to Balochistan, commencing during the 1973-1977 insurgency, and it continuing thereafter. The first case of disappearance was of Asad Mengal, son of the former Chief Minister of Balochistan Atta Ullah Mengal, and his friend Ahmed Kurd in 1976. After Zulfikar Ali Bhutto dissolved the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan in 1973, which provoked the insurgency, people disappeared without trace and were detained without fair trial. Protests by civil society groups and family members of the abductees against State-sponsored ‘enforced disappearances’ and extra-judicial killings are not new. In November 2023, a protest march was sparked by the death of Balaach Mola Bakhsh on November 20, 2023, in an allegedly fake encounter by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD). On December 6, 2023, hundreds of Baloch walked from Kech District in Balochistan to Islamabad, to protest the killing. On July 28, 2024, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) organised a _Baloch Raaji Muchi_ (Baloch National Gathering) against the Baloch genocide. A permanent protest camp set up by VBMP in Quetta, has been a sign of resistance for last 15 years. However, on April 17, the Police dismantled the protest camp set up by the families of political prisoners who had been arrested during the March 2025 protests under the leadership of activist Dr. Mahrang Baloch. The BYC issued a strong condemnation of the Police dismantling the peaceful protest camp set up by families of political prisoners — including Dr. Mahrang Baloch, Shahji Sibghatullah, Bebarg Baloch, Gulzadi Baloch, and Beebow Baloch — all of who remain in custody under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) ordinance. A BYC statement called the Police action “a grave display of authoritarianism.” Earlier, on March 21, 2025, a large protest was organised in front of the Balochistan University in Quetta against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings under the BYC banner, led by Mahrang Baloch. SFs used force to disperse the crowd. The protest had been triggered by the enforced disappearances of Beebagr Baloch, one of BYC’s central leaders, and his brother Dr. Hammal Baloch, on March 20, 2025. Beebagr Baloch, a wheel-chair bound activist and a key BYC leader, has been an outspoken critic of human rights violations in Balochistan, mobilising youth and organising protests, despite his physical disability. Though media reporting was curtailed, the videos surfacing on the social media depicted the Police pushing and dragging protesters into police vans, firing blank shots and using tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstrators. The protests resulted in a violent confrontation between the protesters and the Police, resulting in casualties among protesters and injuries to some Policemen. BYC claimed that three of its members were killed and another 13 were injured. Balochistan Government authorities claimed that 10 Policemen sustained injuries during the clashes. In response to this clash, Mahrang Baloch, BYC key leader, called for a province-wide shutter-down strike to protest against state brutalities and planned another sit-in protest on Sariab Road in Quetta with the bodies of the dead. Later, on March 22, 2025, a pre-dawn raid led to the arrest of Mahrang Baloch and another 16 activists, while also seizing the bodies of those killed. Despite Mahrang’s arrest, the Province saw a complete shutter-down strike on March 23, with shops closed, tyres burnt, roads and major highways closed for traffic, and the region brought to a standstill, disconnected from the rest of the world. On March 22, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) issued statements condemning the Police crackdown against protesters and the arrest of BYC leaders. They demanded the immediate release of all the detainees and called on “all political parties, including those with legitimate support in Balochistan” to “take the lead and engage with all stakeholders in the province, including civil society and academia.” However, the state remained adamant in its authoritarian approach to supressing legitimate Baloch voices. The sister of Mahrang Baloch, Nadia Baloch, during a press conference on March 26, 2015, alleged that the Pakistan Army was subjecting Dr. Mahrang Baloch to extreme torture in jail. Her family was not being allowed to meet her despite court orders and Mahrang's health had deteriorated due to unhealthy food. The judiciary in Pakistan also remains subservient to the Army. On April 15, 2025, the Balochistan High Court refused to rule on Mahrang Baloch’s detention, a decision her lawyers said would delay her case and keep her behind bars. The Balochistan High Court refused to hear an appeal against her detention, instead referring her case to the Federal Ministry of Interior. While, state security agencies have been busy orchestrating enforced disappearances under their ‘kill-and-dump policy’, the state itself has been committed to thoroughly supressing the Baloch right to protest. This systematic repression and the complete neglect of Baloch grievances can only fuel the Baloch insurgency further. | | | --- | | ![](https://www.satp.org/App_Themes/User/CountryLogo/INDIA.png) **INDIA** | [![](https://www.satp.org/Images/socialmedia/facebook.png)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-44)[![](https://www.satp.org/Images/socialmedia/twitter.png)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=SAIR-Volume 23 No.44&url=http://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-44)[![](https://www.satp.org/Images/socialmedia/linkedin.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle/?title=PAKISTAN: Balochistan: Brutality fuels insurgency | INDIA: Naxalism: End of the road &url=https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-44)[![](https://www.satp.org/Images/socialmedia/whatsapp.png)](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-44)[![](https://www.satp.org/Images/socialmedia/email.png)](https://satp.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4a75393f28202f293e776c2b273a7128252e337770223e3e3a6f790b6f780c6f780c3d3d3d64392b3e3a6425382d6f780c2b2e2723246f780c2f272b23266f780c3f3a26252b2e2f2e6f780c262f3e3e2f383964223e27)![Print](https://www.satp.org/Images/socialmedia/print.png) **_Naxalism_: End of the road** Deepak Kumar Nayak Research Associate, _Institute for Conflict Management_ On April 15, 2025, two wanted cadres of the Communist Party of India-Maoist ( **[CPI-Maoist](https://satp.org/terrorist-profile/india/communist-party-of-india-maoist-cpi-maoist-all-its-formations-and-front-organizations)**), carrying a collective bounty of INR 1.3 million, were killed in an encounter with Security Forces (SFs) in the forest of the Kilam-Bargum villages of Kondagaon District in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh. The killed Maoists have been identified as Haldar, a dreaded Maoist ‘commander’ and member of the Maoists’ east Bastar division, who carried a reward of INR 800,000, and Rame, an ‘area committee member (ACM)’, who carried a reward of INR 500,000. The bodies of the Maoists, along with one AK-47 rifle and other weapons and explosives, were recovered from the spot. On April 12, 2025, three CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with SFs on an anti-Maoist operation in a forest in the Indravati National Park area in the Bijapur District of the Bastar Division of Chhattisgarh. One of the slain Maoists was identified as Anil Punem, the Local Operations Squad (LOS) ‘commander’ and Maoist ‘area committee member (ACM)’, who carried a bounty of INR 500,000. Anil was the alleged mastermind of the killing of eight _jawans_ and the driver of the vehicle in which they were travelling, at Ambeli in Bijapur District on January 6, 2025. The identities of the other two slain Maoists are yet to be confirmed. On April 8, 2025, the Special Task Force (STF) of Bihar killed a CPI-Maoist ‘area commander’, carrying a reward of INR 100,000, during a combing operation in the forest areas near the Jharkhand border, in Kalothar Forest under Katoria Police Station limits in the Banka District of Bihar. The body of the Maoist Ramesh Tuddu _alias_ Tetua (45), in ‘uniform’, and a carbine were recovered from the spot. Tuddu was a native of the Budhi Ghat locality under the Katoria Police Station and faced over 11 criminal cases registered in Jamui and Deoghar Districts. On April 2, 2025, two women CPI-Maoist cadres, Mamta _aka_ Ramabai, who hailed from the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra, and Pramila _aka_ Mase Mandavi, from the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh, were killed in an encounter with the Police in the jungles of Mundidadar and Ganheridadar under the Bichhiya Police Station in the Mandla District of Madhya Pradesh. Along with the bodies of the slain Maoists, weapons, including Self-Loading Rifles (SLRs), and wireless sets, were recovered from the encounter spot. According to partial data collated by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), at least 161 _Naxalites_ \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] have been killed by SFs since the beginning of the current year, 2025 (data till April 20). During the corresponding period of 2024, SFs had killed 91 _Naxalites_. Through 2024, SFs killed 296 LWEs, while56 were killed in 2023. Meanwhile, SFs arrested 439 _Naxalites_ in 2024, in addition to 401 in 2023, according to partial data compiled by SATP. In the current year, as on April 20, 2025, 151 arrests had been recorded. A total of 16,862 arrests has been recorded since March 6, 2000. The mounting pressure on the Maoistshas resulted in a large number of surrenders over the past few years, with an acceleration since the declaration that the country would be free of _Naxalism_ before March 2026. According to SATP, at least 475 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2024, in addition to 268 in 2023. During the current year, as on April 20, 2025, at least 600 had already surrendered. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 17,827 LWEs have surrendered across the country. On April 18, 2025, Union Home Minister (UHM) Amit Shah, reiterating the March 2026 deadline for eradicating Naxalism from the country, asked all underground LWEs to surrender as soon as possible and join the mainstream. UHM Shah wrote on 'X'. | | | --- | | I appeal to the hiding _Naxalites_ to lay down their arms as soon as possible and join the mainstream by adopting the surrender policy of the Modi government. We are determined to free the country from the scourge of Naxalism before 31 March 2026. | It is useful to recall that, on January 21, 2024, UHM Shah asserted that the country would be freed of the menace of _Naxalism_ within the next three years, and directed states to expedite development activities in remote areas affected by the ultras. Considering the March 2026 deadline, aggressive SF dominance on the ground greatly improved the overall security situation through 2024. The trend of declining overall fatalities, on a year-on-year basis, in Left Wing Extremism-related violence, established since 2018, witnessed a marginal reversal in 2023, at around 9.62 per cent (from 135 killed in 2022 to 148 in 2023), surged enormously, by over two and a half fold (from 148 in 2023 to 397 in 2024). According to SATP data, a total of 397 fatalities (80 civilians, 21 SF personnel and 296 _Naxalites_) were killed in LWE violence through 2024, as against 148 fatalities (61 civilians, 31 SF personnel and 56 Naxalites) recorded in 2023. During the current year, as of April 20, 2025, the total number of such fatalities stood at 161 (17 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 161 Naxalites), as against 129 such fatalities (27 civilians, 11 SF personnel and 91 _Naxalites_) reported during the corresponding period of 2024. A matter of concern was the spike in the number of civilian fatalities (80) recorded through 2024, as compared to 61 in 2023, about 31.14 per cent. Nevertheless, civilian fatalities recorded in 2024 were the fourth lowest since 2018, according to SATP data. Three other previous lows were recorded at 53 in 2022, 58 in 2021 and 61 (twice) in 2020 and 2023. The maximum number of civilians killed in such violence since 2018, 108, was in 2018. The maximum number of fatalities recorded in this category since March 6, 2000, was 630, in 2010,. Meanwhile, the number of fatalities among SFs decreased from 31 in 2023 to 21 in 2024, according to SATP data, and the number of fatalities in 2024 was the second lowest in this category since 2018. A previous low of 15 was recorded in 2022. The maximum number of SFs killed in such violence, 73, was in 2018. The maximum of such fatalities since March 6, 2000, was 319 in 2009. The SF:Maoist kill ratio greatly favoured the SFs in 2024, at 1:14.09, significantly improving the ratio in favour of the SFs in 2023, when it was at 1:1.80. The 2024 ratio was the best since March 6, 2000, and surpassed the previous best of 1:4.46 in 2022. The ratio favoured the Maoists only thrice: 1:1.2 in 2007, 1:1.01 in 2009 and 1:1.007 in 2010. Since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.76). In the current year, the kill ratio remains in favour of the SFs at 1:10.73 and is the second most positive, thus far (data till April 20, 2025). Other parameters of violence also point to significant improvement in the security situation relating to LWE activities across the country. Due to aggressive SF dominance, the Maoists have hardly been able to carry out their disruptive activities. At least two major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) were carried out by the Maoists in 2024, compared to three such incidents in 2023. The Maoists orchestrated at least 42 incidents of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in 2024, compared to 62 such incidents in 2023. Further, the Maoists were involved in 12 incidents of arson in 2024, as compared to 32 such incidents in 2023. However, there were 116 incidents of exchange of fire between SFs and Maoists in 2024, compared to 89 such incidents in 2023. Through 2024, SFs recovered arms and ammunition from the Maoists on 205 occasions, in addition to 222 such recoveries in 2023. During the current year, as on April 20, 2025, the number of such recoveries stands at 68. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 5,131 occasions of arms recovery have been documented. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from 10 States in 2024, in comparison to 11 States in 2023. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 10 affected States had 35 Districts which recorded a Maoist presence, out of a total of \\_\\_ Districts in these States. Of these, two districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; nine in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 24 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2023, of 50 affected districts from 11 states, six districts fell in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 44 were ‘marginally affected’. Indeed, sharing a similar analysis on the remaining LWE-affected districts, on April 10, 2025, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) through a Press Information Bureau (PIB) release, stated that the number of LWE-affected districts had reduced from 126 to 90 in April 2018, 70 in July 2021 and further to 38 in April-2024. Of the total number of LWE-affected districts, the “most **[affected districts](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2120771&reg=3&lang=1)**” had come down from 12 to six, which include four districts from Chhattisgarh (Bijapur, Kanker, Narayanpur, and Sukma), one from Jharkhand (West Singhbhum), and one from Maharashtra (Gadchiroli). Likewise, out of the total 38 affected districts, the number of “Districts of Concern”, where additional resources needed to be intensively provided (beyond the severely affected districts), had reduced from nine to six. These six districts were: Andhra Pradesh (Alluri Sitarama Raju), Madhya Pradesh (Balaghat), Odisha (Kalahandi, Kandhamal, and Malkangiri), and Telangana (Bhadradri-Kothagudem). Due to persistent action against the Maoists, a number of “Other LWE-affected” Districts had also decreased from 17 to six. These include districts from Chhattisgarh (Dantewada, Gariabandh, and Mohla-Manpur-Ambagarh Chowki), Jharkhand (Latehar), Odisha (Nuapada), and Telangana (Mulugu). Manifestly, analysis of all LWE-affected states across the country indicated an overall declining trend in Maoist violence and activity, and a substantial improvement in the security situation in the affected regions. The annual assessments of the affected states stands testimony to the diminishing influence of the rebels in **[Andhra Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-29#assessment2)**, **[Bihar](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-38#assessment2)**, **[Chhattisgarh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-30#assessment2)**, **[Jharkhand](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-32#assessment1)**, **[Karnataka](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-41#assessment2)**, **[Kerala](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-43#assessment2)**, **[Madhya Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-37#assessment2)**, **[Maharashtra](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-35#assessment1)**, **[Odisha](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-40#assessment2)**, and **[Telangana](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-33#assessment2)**. Meanwhile, according to a January 21, 2025, report, as part of a continued offensive against the CPI-Maoist, the Central Security Forces and the State Police Forces aim to establish 88 additional security camps in LWE-affected states this year. An unnamed senior official of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) disclosed that, since 2019, a total of 290 security camps had been set up in LWE-affected states, mostly in Chhattisgarh and Odisha. In 2024, 48 such camps were established. The significance of such camps is to help the SFs in planning operations against armed Maoist cadres and to fill the security vacuum in areas of erstwhile Maoist dominance. Since 2017-18, INR 35.0329 billion has been released by UMHA under the Special Central Assistance (SCA) scheme for the 12 most LWE-affected districts. The main objective of the scheme is to fill critical gaps in public infrastructure and services in the worst LWE-affected districts. Of the 12, seven worst LWE-affected districts are in Chhattisgarh: Bastar, Bijapur, Sukma, Kanker, Narayanpur, Dantewada, and Mohalla-Manpur-Ambagarh Chowki; two districts are in Odisha: Kalahandi and Kandhamal; and one each in Jharkhand (West Singhbhum), Madhya Pradesh (Balaghat), and Maharashtra (Gadchiroli). A February 25, 2025, report revealed that around 2,500 additional security personnel had been deployed in Chhattisgarh to help encircle the rebels inside the Abujhmadh Forest, before stepping up the offensive against them. The security establishment indicated that the 2,500 additional personnel had been brought in from Odisha and Bihar. An unnamed security official attached to UMHA observed, | | | --- | | They have been deployed in the core areas of Abujhmadh forest, which was earlier considered an impregnable rebel fortress. Besides, the forces are setting up more forward bases deep inside the Maoist strongholds in the state. | As the government intensifies operations in Chhattisgarh's CPI-Maoist strongholds, the Maoists have offered conditional peace talks, though the State government responded be declaring that any talks must be unconditional. On March 28, 2025, through a press release in Telangana, the CPI-Maoist 'central committee (CC)' stated that it was ready for peace talks on the condition that the government halts its anti-Maoist operations in the region and stops the establishment of new camps of armed forces in various States, including in Chhattisgarh. The Maoist statement read, | | | --- | | We are always ready for peace talks in the interest of the public. Therefore, on this occasion, we are proposing to create a positive atmosphere for peace talks in front of the Central and State governments. | Responding to the offer, according to an April 3, 2025, report, State Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma stated that the government was ready for talks and for the Maoists to return to the mainstream, but it could not be subject to conditions laid down by the Maoists. He added that the government was not going to form any committees for peace talks and reiterated that the Maoists could initiate negotiations through any channel of their choice. Sharma stated, | | | --- | | They have written themselves that the last time they had said that they would discuss if \\[security forces\\] should not leave their camps for six months, there should be a reduction in the number of troops, the weapons should remain unused or be deposited. Back then, we had made it clear that with these conditions, there will be no talks. Talks will be without any conditions and we are still ready for that, our Central leadership is ready, Hon. \\[Chief Minister\\] Vishnu Deo Sai ji is ready, there is no problem with talks. But the government will not form any committee. They should make one if they want or use the channel they like, we are ready. | In the meantime, in view of the situation prevailing in Dandakaranya, Chhattisgarh, the CPI-Maoist, in a letter released on April 18, 2025, in the name of Rupesh, the 'spokesperson' of the party's North and West Sub-zonal Bureau, announced that they want a ceasefire from both sides for at least a month. According to the letter, Rupesh thanked Chhattisgarh Deputy Chief Minister (CM) Vijay Sharma for responding to their first statement on April 8. They stated that the ongoing massacre in the name of Operation Kagar would stop only through talks. They clarified that there was no strategy behind their first letter on the same issue, and that their colleagues need to meet the members of the 'Central Committee (CC)' and the Special Zonal Committees (SZC) to resolve the issue. They explained that they needed security assurances to meet their colleagues, along with the delegation representing them in the talks. For this, they appealed for a suspension of SF activities for a month. They added that they had already instructed their colleagues not to open fire on the armed forces during the talks, and asked the government to respond in kind, and observe a ceasefire. Despite having issued their cadres not to attack, they alleged that central forces continued to carry out encounters, adding that, if the massacre continued, no negotiations for a permanent solution could go smoothly. Responding to Rupesh's statement, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar range, Sundarraj P, declared that the government had categorically announced that the Maoists should shun violence and come forward to join the national mainstream, and further, | | | --- | | In that situation the government is always ready to accommodate and rehabilitate each and every Maoist cadre starting from central committee/polit bureau level cadres to militia level cadres. It would be in the interest of all the stakeholders if Maoists dissociate themselves from violent activities and come forward to integrate into the social mainstream. | Clearly, the Maoist movement is under tremendous pressure due to increasing SF dominance over the erstwhile rebel strongholds. However, capacity deficits continue to put an inordinate burden on the SFs, particularly the State Police Forces. According to Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) data, as on January 1, 2023, there were 233,857 vacant posts in the Police Forces of the 10 affected States, against a sanctioned strength of 1,100,919 (actual strength: 867,062). Significantly, these constituted 40.22 per cent of the 581,364 vacant posts across India. Moreover, there were 365 (18.06 per cent) vacancies against a sanctioned strength of 2,020 (actual strength: 1,655) in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) in the 10 affected States, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. Further, in the worst Maoist-afflicted State, Chhattisgarh, there were no telephones in at least 24 Police Stations, as on January 1, 2023. In Jharkhand, considered to be the second worst afflicted State, 47 Police Stations had no vehicle, 211 had no telephone, and 31 had no wireless/mobile connectivity. In Odisha, 17 Police Stations had no wireless/ mobiles. Despite the comprehensive reverses suffered by the Maoists, apprehensions refuse to die. According to a March 28, 2025, report, a CPI-Maoist handwritten letter in Telugu, found at a recent encounter site in the Abujhmarh forest in Bijapur, Chhattisgarh, claimed that the banned outfit had recruited 130 cadres from the Maad region, 80 of them minors, including children aged nine. The letter indicated that the raw recruits were undergoing training in \"guerrilla warfare, weapons handling and IED-making\". According to the Police, the document is believed to be a CPI-Maoist \"review report\" from an internal meeting, and was found after the encounter in which Maoist 'commander' Sudheer alias Sudhakar was shot dead on March 25, 2025. Sudheer carried a bounty of INR 2.5 million and was responsible for training new recruits in weapons and guerrilla tactics. Privy to the development, an unnamed senior officer of Bastar Range thus noted, | | | --- | | Earlier, teenagers were recruited into the Maoist cultural wing, called Chetna Natya Manch (CNM), and later given combat training. If the review report is to be believed, then it indicates a dangerous trend of Maoists recruiting children as 'child soldiers' for the battlefield at a tender age. It would be soldiers vs children. But we will run campaigns to stop this recruitment. | Moreover, the Maoist 'review' noted that it was a \"report on the experiences of newly recruited comrades\" and had been compiled from 'North Bureau directives and ground-level accounts' since January 2023. According to the letter, Maoist leaders conducted a gram sabha (village assembly) in the Maad region and recruited 130 cadres - 50 aged 18-22, 40 aged 14-17 and, alarmingly, 40 aged between nine and 11 years. Senior Maoists admit in the letter that the younger recruits are not yet ready for combat and are in need of \"more education and preparation\". The letter includes a detailed account of the ongoing challenges faced by the Maoist leadership, particularly the difficulty in recruiting new members. Maoist 'commanders' expressed concern about the \"growing reluctance\" among young people to join their cause and realised that future recruitment efforts might be even more challenging. The Maoists are facing severe losses in their remaining ‘havens’ across the country, particularly in their heartland, the Dandakaranya region of Chhattisgarh. The Maoist offer of ‘peace talks’ and appeal for a ceasefire for a month has been met with scepticism, in view of the past ‘failed talks’ more than 20 years ago, when Maoists had come out of the jungles to hold talks with the Andhra Pradesh government amid much fanfare. Regrettably, the talks failed, even as the Maoist exploited the ceasefire to propagate their ideology, recruit more cadres, and extend areas of influence. The Maoist leaders and cadre soon went back into the forests, and the movement saw a dramatic escalation thereafter. The past must, of course, guide the future, but it cannot be the decisive determinant of current policy. The enveloping circumstances have changed dramatically over the intervening decades, and the state would now be negotiating from a position of overwhelming dominance. India has negotiated with numerous insurgencies in multiple theatres, with positive outcomes, and there is no reason to make an exception out of the Maoists. A measure of scepticism is warranted, of course, but avenues for a negotiated settlement need also to be actively explored. | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Weekly Fatalities: Major Conflicts in South Asia** **April 14-20, 2025** | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | **Civilians** | **Security Force Personnel** | **Terrorists/Insurgents** | **NS** | **Total** | | **AFGHANISTAN** | **2** | **0** | **0** | **4** | **6** | | **INDIA** | | | Chhattisgarh | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 2 | | **INDIA (Total)** | **0** | **0** | **2** | **0** | **2** | | **PAKISTAN** | | | Balochistan | 9 | 5 | 8 | 0 | 22 | | Khyber Pakhtunkhwa | 4 | 5 | 16 | 0 | 25 | | **PAKISTAN (Total)** | **13** | **10** | **24** | **0** | **47** | | **Total (South Asia)** | **15** | **10** | **26** | **4** | **55** | | | | --- | | Provisional data compiled from English language media sources. | ![](https://www.satp.org/App_Themes/User/CountryLogo/AFGHANISTAN.png) **Afghanistan** **Taliban's status in the UN remains unchanged, says UN Spokesman:** On April 17, Stéphane Dujarric, the United Nations (UN) Spokesman, said that Russia's recent decision to suspend its ban on the Taliban was a sovereign matter for Moscow and did not alter the Taliban's standing within the UN.

    "full_text": "Even as India and China find themselves **[embroiled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/world/asia/india-china-border.html)** in yet another border standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), **[commentators](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/pakistan-factor-india-china-standoff-161021)** have sounded alarm on how Pakistan could seek to utilize the situation. Concurrently, **[some have observed](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/09/china-india-border-united-states-pakistan/)** that China’s transgression at the border is likely to push New Delhi closer to Washington, at a time when Sino-U.S. tensions are running high. A dyadic understanding of the security environment in Southern Asia, either through an India-Pakistan or India-China lens, is thus incomplete and does not account for the triangular dynamics that shape these interactions. To understand regional dynamics, it is critical to understand the India-Pakistan-China triangle and how it is impacted by the strategic chain, including the United States. The contemporary reality of these dynamics is grounded in an early Cold War history, and potential conflict scenarios involving these countries animate the geopolitics of Southern Asia. **A Triangle Made in History** The India-Pakistan-China triangle is mired in a convoluted history of unresolved border disputes, with military confrontations between India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and India and Pakistan at the Line of Control (LoC) occurring intermittently. In 1947, Britain’s hasty withdrawal from the subcontinent as a result of post-war decolonization led to a haphazard redrawing of political boundaries in Southern Asia, leaving some territory contested. The four wars that India and Pakistan have fought since 1947, the Sino-Indian Border War of 1962, and recurrent India-China and India-Pakistan conflicts at the LAC and LoC trace their genesis back to this protracted history. The military dimension of this triangle evolved in the years after the 1962 Sino-Indian Border War, when Beijing and Islamabad signed the **[border delimitation agreement in 1963](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dXzxLcF92cEC&pg=PA210&dq=China-Pakistan+border+delimitation+agreement+estranged+democracies&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjDydvUnNjpAhWCfH0KHQmRDKUQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=China-Pakistan%20border%20delimitation%20agreement%20estranged%20democracies&f=false)**. As part of this agreement, Pakistan handed over the Trans-Karakoram tract, a territory in Kashmir that India claimed, to China, turning the dispute into **[a trilateral one](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10357716408444182?journalCode=caji19)**. Further, during the **[1965 India-Pakistan War](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DXY8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false),** Pakistan felt betrayed by a lack of U.S. support, and chose to strengthen relations with China. Pakistan **[had expected](https://www.amazon.com/Wages-Globalism-Lyndon-Johnson-American/dp/0195113772)** the United States to tilt to its side, due to the 1954 U.S.-Pakistan mutual defense agreement and Pakistan’s membership in U.S. engineered alliances like the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization. However, during and after the 1962 war, the United States showed hitherto unseen willingness to aid and assist India’s military against Communist China, **[making it prudent](https://www.amazon.in/JFKs-Forgotten-Crisis-Tibet-Sino-Indian/dp/935177788X)** for China and Pakistan to join hands. Although Washington premised arming both Pakistan and India to achieve its Cold War objective to contain communism in Asia, neither side bought Washington’s assurances that its military supplies were not meant to be used against each other. Although China did not provide any direct military help to its new friend Pakistan during the 1965 war, it did engage in a **[psychological assault](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zcylFXH9_z8C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)** against India, repeatedly accusing New Delhi of showing aggression on the India-China border, and threatening Chinese reprisal. During and after the 1971 India-Pakistan War, the United States tilted towards Pakistan, because it needed Islamabad as a conduit to Beijing during the 1972 Sino-U.S. rapprochement talks. Beginning in 1979, Pakistan played a frontline role for the United States in Afghanistan, in the last Cold War tussle between the United States and Soviet Union. In this context, **[geopolitics trumped nonproliferation concerns](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Live-Bomb-Pakistan-1998-2016/dp/0199404569)** as Washington ignored intelligence that China was helping Pakistan develop a nuclear bomb. These conditions were hardly conducive for a healthy Indo-U.S. relationship, despite efforts at finding convergent points during the Reagan presidency. After the Cold War, the subsequent rise of China as a global power, followed by that of India, shifted dynamics of the India-China dyad, leading to heightened Sino-Indian competition, and tightening Sino-Pakistan military ties. Meanwhile, the India-Pakistan relationship remained volatile, taking an even more sinister turn as **[cross-border terrorism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4413952?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)** emanating in Pakistan targeted India, becoming a lingering roadblock to normalizing ties. **The Triangle in Contemporary Times** What characterizes this triangle is the geographical proximity of the three nuclear-armed countries, wherein any military standoff or confrontation is perceived as having the risk of use of nuclear weapons, or the probability of a two-front war for India, against a Sino-Pakistani combined military assault. Today, both **[capabilities and intentions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2538540?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)** play a significant role in shaping **[perceptions and misperceptions](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Perception_and_Misperception_in_Internat.html?id=qqAIuHgi2hoC&redir_esc=y)** within the India-Pakistan-China triangle. Specifically, Pakistan’s power asymmetry relative to that of India, and India’s power gap vis-à-vis China drive each state’s regional posture. Pakistan’s bid to enhance its capabilities, especially through nuclear deterrence and **[with Chinese assistance](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01495933.2013.821850)**, is a means to counter India’s conventional superiority. Meanwhile, China’s growing military capabilities and defense modernization as well as **[its increasing role](https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/growing-chinese-influence-south-asia)** as a development and security partner for not only Pakistan but also a host of other states in India’s neighborhood foment concern in New Delhi. Additionally, what characterizes this triangle is also the **[geographical proximity](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=02XxBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=India-China-Pakistan+nuclear+deterrence+and+geographical+proximity&source=bl&ots=Q4wFzhRuUe&sig=ACfU3U2oCZjw3dBhPI8LJeByW_pisUDVmw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwig59mAltjpAhVEgOYKHVz1CO4Q6AEwCHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=India-China-Pakistan%20nuclear%20deterrence%20and%20geographical%20proximity&f=false)** of the three nuclear-armed countries, wherein any military standoff or confrontation is perceived as having the risk of use of nuclear weapons, or the probability of a two-front war for India, against a Sino-Pakistani combined military assault. However, the Pakistani response to any India-China border confrontation, and a Chinese response to an India-Pakistan war or a military standoff at the borders, is **[more tacit than overt](https://theasiadialogue.com/2017/10/19/the-india-china-pakistan-triangle-strategic-ebbs-and-flows/)**, since the China-Pakistan strategic alliance does not have any unambiguous notion of the two countries coming to each other’s help in the event of a war. **More than a Triangle: The Strategic Chain** Strategic analysts **[increasingly agree](https://carnegieendowment.org/2013/08/05/strategic-triangle-pub-52584)** that the security dynamics of Southern Asia are best explained as a triangle, rather than as an India-Pakistan dyad. However, external players are crucial in shaping outcomes within this triangle, and so regional dynamics may be better depicted as a **[strategic chain](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/acnpi_201703_strategic_chain.pdf)** wherein the United States is the most prominent external agent of influence. The triangle and the strategic chain, as conceptual lenses to understand geopolitics in Southern Asia, are complementary rather than contradictory. While the **[inherent security dilemma](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/acnpi_201703_strategic_chain.pdf)** in the India-Pakistan-China triangle continues to be a major determining factor of the regional security scenario, looking at how the U.S. role complicates responses and counter-responses in this triangle, completes the picture. The emerging security environment in the region can be better explained by considering the concerns regarding China’s rise that drive the Indo-U.S. relationship, China and Pakistan’s threat perceptions vis-à-vis this partnership, and India’s worries emanating from the China-Pakistan alliance. As Chinese influence increases in India’s maritime and continental neighborhood, New Delhi has in turn **[reached out](https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/india-act-east-policy-is-becoming-act-indo-pacific/389502/)** to China’s neighbors to build partnerships with countries in Southeast and East Asia. Rising Sino-Indian competition in both continental and maritime realms, along with the global power tussle between China and the United States, has led to a **[greater strategic embrace](https://mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/32421/Joint_Statement_Vision_and_Principles_for_IndiaUS_Comprehensive_Global_Strategic_Partnership)** between New Delhi and Washington. Beijing, on the one hand, **[tries to convince](https://warontherocks.com/2020/03/chinas-strategic-assessment-of-india/)** New Delhi not to fully align with the United States against China, engaging India in a number of forums such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, Russia, South Africa (BRICS), Russia-India-China (RIC), Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and through bilateral top leadership **[summits](https://jamestown.org/program/india-china-relations-from-the-wuhan-spirit-to-the-chennai-connect/).** On the other hand, Beijing solidifies its strategic outreach to Pakistan, which inherently isolates India, through **[controversial projects](https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/inclusion-of-cpec-under-obor-shows-lack-of-appreciation-of-india-s-concerns-on-sovereignty-119062601263_1.html)** like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The interlocking threat perceptions and responses in the triangle hence cannot be decoupled from the U.S. strategy in the region, making the strategic chain an effective complement to explain the geopolitics of Southern Asia. **Conflict Scenarios** The regional postures of China, India, and Pakistan and the U.S. strategy in Southern Asia intend to maximize interest by capability enhancement, either through internal or external balancing. This makes the security dilemma in the region more acute and creates the possibility of conflict, some scenarios of which are explored below. _Two-front war_ Since India’s border disputes with China and Pakistan are still unresolved and Beijing and Islamabad have a close strategic and military partnership, India perceives any conflagration with either Pakistan or China as raising the specter of a two-front war. The Indian military establishment is overt in asserting its recognition of and readiness to face such an eventuality. For example, General Bipin Rawat, currently India’s Chief of Defense Staff, while serving as the Indian Army Chief, **[commented](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/two-front-war-is-a-real-scenario-says-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/56324336.cms)**, “The two-front is a real scenario. Much has changed from before in terms of our capabilities…The Army, Navy and IAF are now jointly very much prepared for such an eventuality.” India’s military preparedness for a two-front war involves developing its overall deterrent capability and credibility, advances in terms of acquisition and production of military equipment, recalibrating its military strategy, relevant training efforts to meet exigencies, and border infrastructure development. Infrastructure building in the border areas and the issue of terrain advantage has been a [**major source of contention**](https://theprint.in/opinion/china-believes-india-wants-aksai-chin-back-thats-why-it-has-crossed-lac-in-ladakh/430899/), particularly, as seen in the current clashes between Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh, or in the earlier Doklam standoff. While the Indian military establishment understandably **[projects its readiness](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/two-front-war-is-a-real-scenario-says-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/56324336.cms?from=mdr)**, others **[are more skeptical](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-sobering-arithmetic-of-a-two-front-war/)**. The case of Pakistan taking the opportunity of an India-China conflict and opening a second front at the LoC **[is seen as most probable](https://theprint.in/opinion/india-has-a-bigger-worry-than-lac-china-now-expanding-military-footprint-in-indian-ocean/439934/)**. Other scenarios include China opening a second front at the LAC or in the **[Indian Ocean region](https://theprint.in/opinion/india-has-a-bigger-worry-than-lac-china-now-expanding-military-footprint-in-indian-ocean/439934/)** in the event of an India-Pakistan conflict, or a more sinister case of a pre-planned China-Pakistan military assault against India. Indian Army Chief M M Naravane said earlier this year, “\\[…\\]Though it can take place at any level, Siachen and Shaksgam Valley are the places where territory of these two countries meet. Threat of collusivity is maximum in the strategically important glacier which forces us to keep our possession.” Talking about identifying a primary and secondary front in such a scenario, **[he added](https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/01/11/how-will-india-handle-a-two-front-war-army-chief-general-naravane-explains.html)**, “For years, we have been focusing on western border on the basis of threats. Now, we have to rebalance our deployment towards northern sector.” Irrespective of how probable such a scenario is, the perception of such a threat is likely to dictate both the reality and signalling of India’s military preparedness. _Friction in the Strategic Chain_ The India-Pakistan-China triangle is determined by relative national power and mutual threat perceptions, further complicated by the regional implications of the growing confrontation between the United States and China. Pakistan remains the most steadfast ally of China in India’s neighborhood, while India remains the only country in the region that comes closest to competing with growing Chinese influence. Stress in the strategic chain may act as a contributing factor to conflict in the region. The potential for the India-China-Pakistan-United States strategic chain to complicate matters in Southern Asia can be seen in the case of India’s candidacy for Nuclear Suppliers Group membership. **[Washington supports](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/donald-trump-administration-urges-nsg-members-to-support-indias-application/articleshow/59796299.cms?from=mdr)** India’s bid while the **[Chinese oppose it](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/china-says-no-change-in-its-stand-on-indias-membership-to-nsg/articleshow/61964228.cms?from=mdr)**, citing India’s refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and equating India’s candidature to that of Pakistan. Moreover, Beijing **[has been resistant](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/why-china-changed-its-stand-on-masood-azhar/article27211058.ece)** to supporting international efforts to list Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist at the United Nations Security Council, and **[withdrew](https://www.axios.com/china-backs-terror-designation-for-masood-azhar-in-win-for-india-8af16a49-d93e-4632-a5c2-060f0831ee00.html)** their technical hold only last year. Additionally, Afghan security in the midst of American withdrawal is another issue impacting this strategic chain: China’s **[politico-economic role in Afghanistan](https://warontherocks.com/2020/04/chinas-strategic-assessment-of-afghanistan/)** passes through Pakistan. Islamabad has **[been instrumental in bringing](https://www.ft.com/content/66b0906a-993d-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d)** the Chinese establishment closer to the Taliban, as China hopes to checkmate links between Uighur separatists in Xinjiang Province and militants in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Such developments are significant from New Delhi’s view, as it needs to become **[more pragmatic](https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/does-india-have-a-new-playbook-for-a-new-afghanistan/)** to deal with all forces that are central to the future of Afghanistan. This should include talking to the Taliban, to secure its interest in Afghanistan, in the event of an American withdrawal, the return of the Taliban as a political force and Pakistan’s intention to undercut Indian influence. These frictions in the strategic chain exacerbate the inherent tensions in the India-Pakistan-China triad, making differences more intractable and protracted. **Conclusion** The India-Pakistan-China triangle is determined by relative national power and mutual threat perceptions, further complicated by the regional implications of the growing confrontation between the United States and China. Pakistan remains the most steadfast ally of China in India’s neighborhood, while India remains the only country in the region that comes closest to competing with growing Chinese influence. The power asymmetry between India and Pakistan in the former’s favor, and the **[growing power imbalance](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-china-ladakh-lac-border-dispute-c-raja-mohan-6449294/)** between India and China in the latter’s favor will continue to reinforce the inherent security dilemma of the triangle, justifying China-Pakistan collusion, in order to checkmate India’s rise in the region. Moreover, Chinese perceptions of a U.S. containment strategy that involves India additionally impacts the triangle. The broad mistrust and zero-sum perceptions in the triangle will continue to determine the probability of crises and conflict playing out at the LAC and LoC. Besides the more volatile responses and counter-responses over the disputed borders, differences will simmer at global forums over issues such as counterterrorism and nonproliferation, and over the regional security situation in Afghanistan. Despite attempts at diplomatic maneuvers and confidence building measures to arrest uncontrolled escalation and inadvertent conflict in the triangle, the complex dynamics of the India-Pakistan-China triangle, further reinforced by the role of the United States in the region, make conflict a regular phenomenon that has to be managed, rather than eliminated.

Picture source: Depositphotos. _Prospects & Perspectives No. 28_ **The Shadow War: How the Pahalgam Terror Attack Redefined India-China-Pakistan Equation** By _Jagannath Panda_ The Pahalgam [terror attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl) of April 2025, executed by the Pakistan-backed group [The Resistance Front](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473) (TRF), was not merely another episode in the long-running saga of India-Pakistan hostility. It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. By and large, India’s reaction was strong, swift, and assertive beyond the border against the terrorist outfits harbored in Pakistan. The launch of [Operation Sindoor](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473), a precise military response targeting terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC), marked a defining evolution in India’s deterrence doctrine, pointing to a zero-tolerance strategy against terrorism. More than a tactical strike, it was a message — India will respond with resolve, not restraint, when its civilians are attacked. The operation drew clear parallels with the Balakot airstrikes of 2019, yet the context had shifted. The regional climate in 2025 is far more combustible, with trilateral tensions simmering in the Himalayas. The Pahalgam incident has exposed deep-seated fractures in the regional power matrix. China’s strategic posture in the aftermath — marked by conspicuous silence, selective language, and diplomatic hedging — underscores a growing contradiction between its self-styled image as a responsible global power and its operational behavior in South Asia. By refusing to acknowledge the terrorist dimension of such attacks or to pressure its close partner, Pakistan, Beijing reveals a troubling unwillingness to act as a genuine stabilizing force in the region. The contradictions in its stand are only growing and becoming more transparent to the world by the day. Is China truly committed to regional peace and stability, or is it bound by time-worn strategic alignments that prioritize geopolitical advantage over normative responsibility? Can a power that positions itself as an architect of global order afford to undermine its credibility by shielding a state associated with cross-border terrorism? What should be India’s strategic response to this shadow war? **Beijing’s Balancing Act: Neutrality or Strategic Collusion?** Following India’s retaliation, the world watched closely for diplomatic fallout. China’s response was a masterclass in studied ambiguity. Beijing termed India’s military action “ [regrettable](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202505/t20250507_11616523.html)” while conspicuously omitting any condemnation of the terror attack itself. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made [no mention](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/lxjzh/202505/t20250509_11618305.html) of the victims in Pahalgam, nor TRF’s Pakistani connections. Instead, Beijing’s focus remained firmly on urging “restraint” and “dialogue,” echoing a playbook that has often shielded Islamabad from international censure. This is not entirely a new behavior on the part of the Chinese leadership. Beijing has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the UN Security Council to [block designations of known terrorists](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slams-china-at-un-for-blocking-move-to-designate-2611-accused-sajid-mir-as-global-terrorist/article66993043.ece) based in Pakistan, including Sajid Mir, a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander involved in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008. This pattern of diplomatic protection underscores China’s strategic calculus: Pakistan is more than an ally — it is a linchpin in Beijing’s South Asia strategy and a buffer against Indian regional ascendency. What makes China’s stance especially problematic is its persistent refusal to differentiate between India’s counterterrorism actions and aggressive behavior. Chinese state media and official discourse frequently conflate Indian responses along the LoC with assertive conduct along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), crafting a narrative in which India is portrayed as a regional aggressor. This distortion allows Beijing to simultaneously align with Pakistan’s security outlook while maintaining a superficial neutrality. Moreover, China’s behavior mirrors its broader geopolitical approach: internal threats such as “Uyghur separatism” are met with uncompromising state violence, while external threats that affect neighbors like India are compartmentalized or ignored. The selective outrage is a window into Beijing’s dual standards on terrorism and state sovereignty. **Proxy Wars and Silent Partners: Redrawing the Diplomatic Map** Beyond the rhetoric, Beijing’s alignment with Pakistan is rooted in hard interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the crown jewel of Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This infrastructure project is not just about roads and pipelines — it’s about strategic depth. Any Indian challenge to the territorial status quo threatens both Pakistan’s and China’s investments, thereby sealing the logic of Beijing’s indirect complicity. This complicity extends into the diplomatic arena. In multilateral forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China has consistently [blocked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/human-rights-must-be-respected-india-after-skipping-xinjiang-vote/articleshow/94713915.cms) Indian attempts to highlight Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism. Instead, China promotes counterterrorism frameworks that align neatly with its own domestic narratives, especially those concerning Xinjiang, while conveniently avoiding issues that implicate Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues its [strategic silence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/22/asia/imran-khan-xinjiang-axios-intl-hnk) on China’s repression of Uyghur Muslims, despite its self-styled image as a champion of the Islamic world. This tacit exchange of blind spots — on terrorism and human rights — has become the bedrock of the Sino-Pakistani axis. And India, despite walking a tightrope on sensitive Chinese issues like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, has received no reciprocation in the form of diplomatic neutrality or support. The geopolitical geometry is clear: while India and Pakistan battle over borders and ideology, China plays the dual role of facilitator and firewall for Islamabad. Whether in backchannel diplomacy or in global institutions, China consistently acts to dilute pressure on Pakistan, reinforcing a strategic triangle that disadvantages New Delhi at every turn. Beijing’s deliberate omission of Pakistani provocations and cross-border violence in its Operation Sindoor response press briefings suggests a calculated strategic posture. This silence reflects China’s continued alignment with Pakistan, indicating that broader geopolitical considerations outweigh any immediate concerns about regional instability. By not publicly addressing Islamabad’s role, China signals its intent to preserve and prioritize its long-standing strategic partnership with Pakistan. **A Call for India’s Strategic Realignment** In this increasingly tangled web of interests, India must reassess its China doctrine. The idea of Beijing as a potential stabilizer in South Asia has little basis in reality. Instead, China has shown a consistent willingness to prioritize its strategic partnerships and investments over regional peace or normative alignment against terrorism. One avenue for India is to adopt a strategy of normative reciprocity. If China insists on referring to Jammu and Kashmir as a “disputed territory,” India could begin more openly addressing Chinese sensitive issues, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and potentially even Taiwan, revisiting its “One China” policy. Until now, India has largely upheld a principle of “mutual sensitivity” regarding core sovereignty concerns. While China has been increasingly assertive in internationalizing the Kashmir issue — whether through UN Security Council interventions, statements aligning with Pakistan, or selective cartographic provocations — India has avoided reciprocal commentary on China’s sensitive regions. This asymmetric restraint has allowed China to shape narratives unchallenged, while denying India the same deference on issues central to its national unity. Engaging Taiwan more openly — especially on trade, technology, and democratic solidarity — aligns India with other democracies like the U.S., Japan, and parts of Europe that have gradually normalized unofficial ties. Strengthening ties with Taiwan also offers India access to high-end manufacturing, especially in semiconductors, where Taiwan’s TSMC dominates global supply chains, critical for India’s tech and defense sectors. A closer India-Taiwan dynamic could be used as part of a broader Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance Chinese assertiveness in the region, especially when coupled with defense dialogues like the Quad. Explicit moves on Taiwan would likely provoke strong diplomatic and possibly economic retaliation from Beijing. This could take the form of border pressure along the LAC, trade restrictions, or cyber disruptions. Any move on Taiwan would have more impact if coordinated with partners like the U.S., Japan, or Australia. A unilateral shift may yield limited strategic gain while exposing India to disproportionate costs. It is therefore imperative that India must continue to invest more robustly in multilateral and minilateral coalitions that exclude or counterbalance China, such as the Quad, the India-Japan-Australia trilateral, and enhanced EU engagements. India’s aspiration to be recognized as a major international power, including in the “Global South,” depends not solely on its material capabilities but also on its normative influence, particularly in shaping global discourses on terrorism. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, New Delhi may need to recalibrate its approach by intensifying collaboration with global norm entrepreneurs, including middle powers across Europe and Asia, as well as transnational civil society and multilateral institutions. Moreover, India’s leadership roles in forums such as the G20 and BRICS present strategic platforms through which it can reframe regional security narratives and assert its vision for counterterrorism norms. Domestically, India must prepare for the long haul. The possibility of a coordinated two-front scenario — with Pakistan engaging in asymmetric warfare through proxy actors and irregular tactics and China providing strategic and diplomatic cover — is no longer hypothetical. Preparing for this evolving threat environment requires India to adopt a comprehensive and long-term security posture, encompassing military modernization, institutional resilience, and societal preparedness. Enhancing border infrastructure, upgrading intelligence and surveillance capabilities, and fortifying strategic deterrence must be non-negotiables in India’s defense roadmap. Sustaining a prolonged state of readiness requires a resilient defense-industrial base, robust supply chains, and financial planning. India must continue reforms to reduce dependence on foreign arms imports, incentivize indigenous R&D, and create strategic reserves for critical materials. Further, building robust logistical networks, especially in border states and high-altitude regions, will improve troop mobility and sustain long-term deployments. Civil-military synergy in infrastructure projects such as roads, airfields, and telecommunications along both western and eastern frontiers is essential. The shifting threat landscape demands that India move beyond reactive postures. Both Pakistan and China are adept at leveraging information warfare and disinformation to influence public opinion and sow discord. India must invest in counter-disinformation capacities, strategic communication, and public awareness campaigns to build regional and societal resilience against foreign psychological operations, where Taiwan could emerge as a stronger partner. New Delhi must significantly enhance its capabilities in narrative warfare — a strategic effort to shape perceptions, control the discourse, and influence international opinion. This involves not only countering adversarial narratives but also proactively framing its own story in a manner that resonates with global audiences. India’s case against Pakistan-based terrorism, as well as China’s tacit support through diplomatic silence or selective framing, must be articulated with clarity, credibility, and moral authority. To be effective, this narrative must be disseminated across multiple global platforms — from the United Nations and international media to think tanks, academic forums, and digital diplomacy channels — to expose the regional destabilizing roles of both Pakistan and China, and to align international sentiment with India’s security concerns and normative positions. The decision to send [delegations](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seven-all-party-delegations-to-take-indias-message-against-terrorism-to-key-partner-nations-government/article69586448.ece) to 32 nations is a strong first step. Publishing credible evidence, such as satellite imagery, financial trail disclosures, or intercepted communications, can further strengthen the factual basis of India’s narrative and pre-empt counterclaims. **Conclusion: Pahalgam as a Turning Point** The Pahalgam terrorist attack will be remembered not just for its human toll, but for what it revealed about the shifting tectonics of regional power complexities. It was a moment of clarity: India is not just facing a belligerent neighbor in Pakistan, but also contending with a cunning and double-standard power in China that is willing to obscure terrorism behind the veil of strategic self-interest. Increasingly, China’s actions — or calculated inactions — are rendering its strategic contradictions more visible to the international community, challenging the coherence of its South Asia policy and weakening its claim to impartiality in regional conflict resolution. The path ahead for India requires more than conventional military readiness; it calls for a fundamental reassessment of the strategic assumptions underpinning India's approach to China, particularly regarding Beijing’s role in shaping, enabling, or deferring regional crises. New Delhi’s challenge is two-fold. It must deter asymmetric threats from across the border, and it must decode and counteract the quieter, more insidious enablers of that threat. That means not just stronger borders, but sharper diplomacy. Not just better arms, but better arguments. Narrative warfare, if conducted strategically, allows India not just to defend its position but to shape the global agenda on terrorism and regional order, reinforcing its claim to normative leadership as a rising power. Pahalgam may have been a tragedy for India, but it is also an inflection point. A new foreign policy realism must follow. Because in this geopolitical theatre, the shadows are as dangerous as the swords.

Its four primary partners, U.S. Pacific Command, Tripler Army Medical Center, the University of Hawaii and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention act collectively to support a body of operational research. Disaster Response in India represents the first product of these efforts. The Center of Excellence, a unique and forward-thinking partnership, acts as a facilitator among the many organizations which are critical players in the delivery of disaster management, relief and recovery. Its research mission cuts across organizational boundaries and thus the Center is able to identify proposals of universal benefit. Focusing through a collaborative lens allows the Center to work with more appropriate, multi-pronged approaches leveraged across civilian, military and private partnerships. The commitment to support operational research in a variety of fields and disciplines - from public and mental health issues in refugee populations to re-establishing functioning infrastructure in devastated communities - evolved from the core purposes of the Center, which is to bring together the best individuals and organizations who are dedicated to improving the world’s ability to respond to natural and complex humanitarian events. The authors’ work herein, the culmination of many hours of intensive labor, contributes to an appreciation of foreign disaster management processes, encourages international cooperation, and supports disaster management institutions and professionals in all countries and regions. To conduct and publish findings as these is of benefit to all peoples. In our shrinking, interdependent world, the drop of even a small stone in one place leads to ripples felt in the most remote corners of the world. It is our hope that this document will see widespread distribution, and through extensive use that it be passed along to colleagues as a tome on the topic. Fredrick M.

The number has been increasing every year because of the mixture of various factors such as adverse weather, population growth, urbanization, and industrialization. How the Republic of India organizes for managing significant natural and man-made disasters, its capacity for effective response, and its ability to achieve unity of effort among governmental and non-governmental organizations are the elements of analysis here. This is of interest because India is an emerging world power; it is currently the second largest country in the world in population, and by 2050 it will have surpassed China as the largest. The number of Indians affected by disaster events shows a steady upward trend. Disasters have been taking a heavy toll of human and animal lives. Floods have proven to be the most devastating type of natural disaster in India, causing the maximum number of deaths and damage to property (cyclones have taken a heavy toll of lives and caused widespread devastation). At the same time, droughts affect a large segment of population, resulting in loss of employment and migration to other regions. Earthquakes have caused a comparatively lower amount of damage, but landslides are likely to increase in frequency in the coming years because of deforestation and over development on hillsides. Conurbation and industrialization have combined to create a dangerous synergy that now presents a significant hazard to India’s people. In responding to these kinds of hazards, India’s disaster management officials and professional humanitarians conduct disaster planning and response generally within a paradigm of three phases: Pre-disaster; Emergency (or Disaster Impact); Post Disaster(or Recovery). There is a strong emphasis in government policy and planning to encourage mitigation, i.e., actions taken prior to the occurrence of a disaster, including preparedness and long-term risk reduction measures. 1 Elephants on the Rajpath Defending Rashtrapati Bhavan (President’s Palace) To encourage effective training, coordination and planning for disaster response, the Government of India established in 1995 a National Center for Disaster Management; and in 1998, India’s Minister for Agriculture announced the formation of a National Commission on Disaster Management. These will facilitate the evolution of a National Disaster Management Plan. The Plan is now under development and is expected to be completed in 2001. RESPONSE SYSTEM Under India’s federal system, the states have responsibility for disaster response. When the disasters is severe or spread over several states, the Central Government supplements the efforts of state governments by providing financial and material assistance. Government policy response to a natural calamity is provided by the Prime Minister, Cabinet Committees and the Agriculture Minister. The objectives of policy response are to address the sufferings of the people affected by the natural calamity. A policy response often leads to visits to the calamity affected areas by President, Prime Minister and other dignitaries; setting up machinery for implementing, reviewing and monitoring the relief measures; and activating the administrative response process for assistance in relief measures. The state governments in India are autonomous in organizing relief operations in the event of natural disaster and also for purposes of long term preparedness and rehabilitation measures. The states deal with natural disasters through their Revenue Departments or Relief Organizations. 2 REVENUE Division Commissioner DISTRICT MAGISTRATE Divisional Sub-Divisional MAGISTRATE TEHSILDARS PATEL OR PATWARI (POLICY AND PLANNING) (CONTROL ROOM) (DISTRICT) (SUB-DIVISION) (TEHSIL) (VILLAGE) OTHER DEPARTMENTS POLICE HOME GUARD CIVIL DEFENSE STATE CRISIS MANAGEMENT GROUP EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER RELIEF COMMISSIONER STATE GOVERNMENT CHIEF SECRETARY TYPICAL ORGANIZATION FOR STATE EMERGENCY The states also have a State Crisis Management Group (SCMG) which functions under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary and/or Relief Commissioner. The Group comprises senior officers from the departments of revenue and relief, home, civil supplies, power, irrigation, water supply, local self government (panchayat), agriculture, forests, rural development, health, planning, public works and finance. States develop the contingency plans for disaster response and long-term strategies for mitigation. The state response plan identifies the functional areas such as relief, communications, information, transport, health services, etc. and proposes assignments to the various departments. The plan also lays down preparedness checklists, operating procedures and reporting formats. The state mitigation strategy argues for better land use management, building codes, traffic standards, health standards, and so on. These objectives are to be secured through disaster legislation, mitigation regulation, and incentives for mitigation. The State Relief Commissioner establishes an Emergency Operations Center (Control Room) as soon as disaster situation develops. The Center collects and disseminates the latest information on forecasting and warning of disaster, and functions as the focal point for coordinating disaster relief efforts with the other concerned departments. THE FIRST RESPONDERS Every state is divided into a number of districts. The head of the district administration is known as the District Magistrate or Deputy Commissioner. (In some states, he is better known as the Collector). The District Magistrate is in charge of all the relief measures at the district level. The State government routes its instructions through him, and the District Magistrate ensures that the total efforts of the district are geared in a coordinated manner to providing disaster relief to the people. Sometimes, in emergency situations, the District Magistrate’s powers are enhanced with a view to ensuring complete unison in the efforts of all the concerned departments. A district is further sub-divided into sub-divisions and tehsils. The head of the sub-division is called a Sub-Divisional Officer or Deputy Collector while the tehsil is headed by an officer called the Tehsildar. The lowest unit of administration is the village whose revenue matters are attended to by a functionary known as Patel or Patwari. These lower tiers of administration provide the first responders that do the work, and 3 they are a critically important source of leadership during disaster events. When disaster strikes, the District Magistrate activates his contingency plan with the help of Control Room staff who monitor rescue and relief efforts. Also assisting is the District Relief Committee which includes local representatives of the people, members of the legislative assembly and the parliament. Through these mechanisms, the District Magistrate coordinates with central government authorities and defense forces, and he synchronizes the voluntary efforts of NGOs with the efforts of the district administration. THE NGOS India has a strong tradition of voluntary organizations responding to any calamity or disaster overwhelming the people. The voluntary organizations offer immediately available communications within the disaster affected community, technical services, manpower, and financial support. Services provided by the NGOs include awareness and information campaigns, training for local volunteers, immediate rescue and first aid, psychological aid, food, water, medicine, other materials, sanitation and hygiene, damage assessment, reconstruction and financial aid. The 1998 cyclone in Gujarat provides some idea of the scope of NGO emergency assistance during a disaster event in India: • CARE-India: food for two months and 350 tents worth Rs. 700,000; • CARITAS: housing reconstruction; • Catholic Relief Service: $10,000 for shelter and drinking water, and 161 tonnes of food supplies; • The Discipleship Center: plastic sheets, utensils, bed sheets, sarees, dhotis, and children’s clothing; • OXFAM: food grains, plastic sheets, clothing; • World Vision:roof tiles, wood materials for home reconstruction. India prefers not to request disaster assistance in any formal way from donor nations or international organizations. Its stated policy is that India will rely on its own resources to resolve disaster situations. But it is difficult to imagine disaster relief operations without the 4 contributions of the international and India-based NGOs. To avoid being at cross purposes with Indian policy, international organizations and donor nations usually provide disaster assistance resources to local level governments and grass-roots organizations via on-site NGOs. DISASTER RESPONSE AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE Disaster events in recent years have placed great demands on India’s disaster management system, and the year 1998 was a particularly bad one for the country. Floods affected several states. A cyclone of severe intensity devastated Gujarat. Landslides took a heavy toll of human lives in the hill regions of Uttar Pradesh. The Orissa cyclone of 1999 was the greatest natural disaster the country has faced in the 20th century. These hazards illustrate the magnitude of the challenge. Floods There were unprecedented rains in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir in September 1988. In Kapurthala district, the water from Beas river submerged about 150 villages under 8 to 12 feet of water. In Jalandhar, fifty per cent of the standing crops were destroyed. In Ropar, thousands of people were trapped in flood waters and had to spend several nights on the rooftops of their houses. Gurdaspur town had two to four feet of water. The Government of India formed a Crisis Management Group under the chairmanship of the Relief Commissioner. The Armed Forces helped to evacuate people, and provided air, land and water transportation. A voluntary body known as Flood Relief Society was formed with Justice Ajit Singh Bains, a retired judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, as Chairman to provide relief to the flood affected people of Punjab. The Society made Sikh and Hindu temples the focal points for collecting relief material. In Himachal Pradesh, Kinnaur, Una, Chamba, Kulu and Shimla were badly affected. More than a dozen bridges in different parts of the State collapsed, and about two thousand persons were marooned in the Pong dam area. Una was completely cut off. People living in Chamba along the Ravi river had to be shifted to safer places. The Border Security Forces personnel were marooned at their outposts. Thein dam was threatened. The Grand Trunk Road between Beas, Rayya and Khalichain was submerged under three to four feet of water. 5 Over 405 thousand cubic feet per second (cusecs) of water was flowing in river Sutlej on September 24 against its capacity of 305 thousand cusecs. There was panic about the safety of the Bhakra Dam. The reservoir attained the highest ever level of 1687.47 ft., which was above the maximum storage level designed for the dam. The Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) released the extra water without bothering about the capacity of the reservoirs below. The BBMB did not warn the district authorities or the people before releasing the water. People in areas downstream were caught unawares–aggravating the magnitude of the disaster. There was loss of life and property on a massive scale. In northern areas of India, catchment areas have deteriorated due to increasing deforestation and urbanization leading to the reservoirs getting silted, their storage capacity reduced, and life span cut short. The 1998 floods also affected large areas of northern and eastern states with Upper Assam being the worst affected. Nearly 5,000 villages were submerged, and a total of 3.6 million people were affected by the fury of the Brahmaputra river. Majuli, the largest river island in the world, was completely submerged and over 100,000 people living on the island had to be evacuated. In West Bengal, more than half the total population of Malda were rendered homeless–1.5 million people. Large areas of Murshidabad were inundated by the Bhagirathi river. Army and the Border Security Force personnel assisted the State administration in the rescue and relief operations. The Navy also sent boats and a team of 50 people including doctors to Malda. In Bihar, a total of nearly 12 million people in over 7,200 villages in 28 districts in north and central Bihar were affected. Army personnel assisted in relief works in Katihar and Darbhanga districts. There were floods in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya also. The severity of flooding in these states was comparatively less in the strategic sense, but no less serious to the victims. Cyclones in Gujarat and Orissa Gujarat state was lashed by a severe cyclonic storm on June 9, 1998. About 1,250 people were killed while over one thousand were reported missing. There was devastation on a large scale in the districts of Kutch, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Porbandar, Junagadh, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Banaskantha, Surat, Bharuch, Valsad and Navsari. Nearly 66 hectares of agricultural land was eroded and thousands of trees were uprooted. 6 The gateway along the Gulf of Kutch became a graveyard of vessels with 40 ships having run aground and five of them actually sinking. The Gujarat government reacted with a “caterpillar-like pace,” according to India Today magazine. In the State Assembly, the Congress members, during discussions on the tragedy, harped on the point that a majority of lives lost on June 9, 1998 along the Saurashtra-Kutch coastline could have been saved had the State Government implemented a sound disaster management plan. The Union Home Minister conceded that the cyclone forecast of the Meteorological Department had gone awry as there was no mention in its forecast that Kutch district, which was worst affected, would be hit. There was also lack of communication between the Kandla Port Trust Authorities and the district administration. It also came to light that the Kandla Port Trust had been repeatedly warned about the consequences of tampering with coastal ecosystems and building too many new projects in the Kandla Port area. Political considerations had led to project after project being cleared. The Government of Gujarat had even altered the Coastal Management Plan to facilitate projects in the Coastal Regulation Zone. In recent years, construction of chemical facilities, petroleum complexes, cement factories, ports and jetties had stripped the coastal natural barriers formed by coral outcrops, sand banks, mangrove plants and dunes. Nothing remained to impede the 200 km/h cyclonic winds and four-meter tidal waves—a large number of innocents died. In response, the Government of India decided to give assistance to the maritime states in the Ninth Plan for the protection of critical reaches of coastal areas. Under this scheme, the coastal areas would be protected by constructing sea walls. The Coastal Protection and Development Advisory Committee has prepared a comprehensive National Coastal Protection Project estimated to cost Rs. 16 billion. The cyclone which lashed Orissa on October 29, 1999 has been described by Sitakant Mahapatra as “perhaps the greatest tragedy Orissa has faced since the Kalinga war that converted... Ashoka to Buddhism.” The death toll was over 10,000 and the total loss of property has been estimated at Rs. 10 billion. Landslides On August 18, 1998, a massive landslide wiped out the entire Malpa village in the Pithoragarh district of Uttar Pradesh, killing about 210 people. Earlier, 76 people were killed in devastating landslides in the 7 Ukhimath block of Rudraprayag district on August 12. There were landslides in the Ukhimath area again on August 19, killing 26 people. A total of nearly 400 people are estimated to have been killed and 12 villages were wiped out in a series of landslides spread over a period of ten days in the hill regions of Uttar Pradesh. A team of 200 personnel from the Army, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Pradeshik Armed Constabulary and Border Security Force was rushed to Malpa to carry out the relief operations. The State Government announced an ex gratia of Rs. one hundred thousand each to the next of kin of those killed in the tragedy, Rs. 50,000.00 each to the injured, and Rs. 25,000.00 for the reconstruction of damaged houses. The community response was spontaneous. A correspondent who toured the region commented that the Ukhimath community set a stellar example in altruism. Every family fed at least one person affected by the landslides. “We take it that every family has one more member to look after,” as a student of the Garhwal University said. The Yuvak Mangal Dal and the Mahila Mangal Dal, voluntary associations of youth and women in the region, did yeoman’s service in rushing to the unsafe areas with succor. The Himalayan Environment Studies and Conservation Organization, an NGO, sent medicines and relief materials. In spite of recurring landslides in the region, adequate attention has not been paid to planning and preventative measures. The cumulative effects of deforestation, erosion, water-logging, salinity and nutrient depletion all over the country have led to a loss of approximately Rs.232 billion. Technological Disaster–Long-term Effects Remain The Bhopal gas tragedy, which took place on December 3, 1984, was the worst technological disaster of the country. It was the result of faulty design, poor maintenance and unsatisfactory plant operation. Union Carbide, a U.S.-based multinational company, had a plant manufacturing Sevin and other pesticides at Bhopal. On the night of December 2, methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas escaped into Bhopal’s night air. It is estimated that as as many as 18,000 human deaths resulted from the incident, and large numbers of livestock perished. Today, some 15 years after the event, relatively few people have been properly compensated for their losses, and there are perhaps as many as 125,000 people who are in an acute state of ill health as a result of a whole range of diseases like breathlessness, eye problems, 8 neurological disorders, menstrual and other reproductive abnormalities, anxiety, depression and obstructive pulmonary disease. The Bhopal experience has provided a number of lessons, such as the need to regulate the growth of industries producing hazardous products. The most important of these is suggested by Dr. R. B. Sharma, Director of the Disaster Management Institute in Bhopal: The basic point of disaster management recovery is the human dimension. We are too concerned with the material. There is little attention to what happens after the disaster. The cyclones, earthquakes, floods, and landslides of 1998 and 1999, as well as the lingering effects of the Bhopal tragedy, suggest the grand dimensions of India’s disaster management challenge. It also suggests the capabilities and capacities for disaster management in India today. THE FUTURE FOR INDIA’S DISASTER MANAGEMENT The overall trend is towards more disaster-related deaths and losses. Some reasons for this are: • Continuing population growth which will overload the available infrastructure and services, even without the advent of disasters; • Increasing pressure on a land that will have to feed the world’s most populous nation but, year after year, is vulner\u0002able to the vagaries of weather; • Uneven economic growth that may result in a better life for some sectors while leaving oth\u0002ers destitute and unable to ward off hazards; • Interdependence of countries and regions whereby hazards in one region impact directly on others, such as low-land flooding caused by denudation of upland forests, or a nuclear accident in one region which casts fallout on another. 9 Bhopal: The Union Carbide Plant as it Appears Today. Experience shows that in the event of a disaster, the government response is generally tardy. Critics suggest that this is because the bureaucracy, which was once considered the “steel frame” of administration, has over the years become inefficient and corrupt. Millions are spent on flood protection schemes and drought relief measures, but only a fraction really shows. Analyzing disaster management in India, Times of India commentator Rajiv Desai recently wrote: Lives are lost, families ruined and property is destroyed. The only survivors are those who govern: politicians, bureaucrats and their retinue. ...no one is held accountable for public safety. Thus, the very minimum requirement of governance is waived. Never mind disaster management, the government itself is the disaster. The Government of India has the requisite structure to cope with disasters. There are detailed orders and manuals on related subjects, particularly at the state level. However, the Central Government has yet to publish a national emergency management plan and lacks the formal and official framework for strategic guidance and doctrinal development. Nevertheless, the confluence of effort by professionals associated with organizations such as the National Center for Disaster Management, Disaster Management Institute, Indira Gandhi National Open University, and so on, has developed a body of knowledge relevant to India’s situation. The universal themes which have evolved from this effort suggest the following doctrinal imperatives for future initiatives: • A strong focus on disaster prevention and mitigation; • Long-term measures to fight earthquake–economic and technical effort; • Control of economic development to reduce the impact on the land and resulting changes to the flow of water run-off; • Setaside funding by the states for disaster emergencies, aug\u0002mented by Central Government grants; • The need for networking among disaster management organiza\u0002tions, government agencies, and non-government volunteer or\u0002ganizations; 10 • An emphasis on training and publishing the professional body of knowledge; • Emphasis on the human dimension of disasters, particularly the social, medical, and psychological aspects of long-term recovery. Given India’s constitutional guidelines of state responsibility for disaster management, a ponderous bureaucracy, an historical preference for devolving responsibility to regional levels of government, it seems likely that India’s forthcoming National Disaster Management Plan will provide generalized policy constructs. The locus of disaster prevention and relief will remain with state governments, with the primary burden carried by the District Magistrate. Under siege by the current onslaught of cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and landslides, nuclear weapons bring an added dimension to India’s disaster management challenge. The confrontation between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir problem poses a proximate threat to peace and stability in the sub-continent. The acquisition of nuclear capability by both India and Pakistan has added a new and unwanted component to disaster prevention and assistance. As some Indian disaster specialists suggest, there remains some comfort in what seems to be India’s almost unlimited capacity to absorb shocks. There have been waves of invasion from across the north-west frontier through the centuries, but the spirit of India was never vanquished. India always reasserted itself, and with this spirit of certitude India will approach the coming challenges of disaster response in the new millennium. 11",

Aligned with China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) and bolstered by pseudo-private contractors such as i-SOON (Anxun Information Technology Co., Ltd.), Salt Typhoon employs custom firmware implants, living-off-the-land binaries, and stealthy router rootkits to maintain persistent, covert access within major telecom environments across the United States, United Kingdom, Taiwan, and the EU. ## **State-Sponsored Espionage and Persistent Access** Salt Typhoon initiates operations by scanning for and exploiting known CVEs in network edge devices routers, [VPN](https://cyberpress.org/aws-client-vpn-for-windows-flaw/) concentrators, and firewalls often combining automated brute-force methods with unpatched software vulnerabilities. Upon gaining entry, the group deploys resilient, firmware-level implants that survive routine updates, embedding encrypted HTTPS-based command-and-control (C2) channels within legitimate management protocols. These implants beacon at irregular intervals and blend with normal network management traffic, effectively evading detection by security monitoring tools. Through these long-dwell footholds, Salt Typhoon exfiltrates vast quantities of telecom intelligence, including VoIP configurations, session metadata, call detail records (CDRs), lawful intercept logs, and SS7 routing information. A 2024 breach of multiple U.S. carriers, such as AT&T and Verizon, resulted in terabytes of stolen metadata, while a concurrent compromise of several state National Guard VPN gateways yielded network diagrams, administrator credentials, and incident response playbooks assets that can facilitate both real-time surveillance and battlefield preparation. A notable tradecraft feature is Salt Typhoon’s use of bulk-registered domains under fabricated U.S. personas. By registering dozens of English-language domains via ProtonMail and provisioning commercial DV certificates from GoDaddy and Sectigo, the group crafted seemingly benign SaaS portals. However, recurring name servers like irdns.mars.orderbox-dns.com and registrant aliases such as “Shawn Francis” and “Monica Burch” created distinctive attribution signatures that defenders have leveraged to cluster and map the actor’s infrastructure. Underpinning this infrastructure are front companies and contractors based in Chengdu and Beijing Sichuan Juxinhe, Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong, and Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie disguised as legitimate cybersecurity firms. These entities operate domain registration pipelines, host C2 servers, and supply covert tooling under the veneer of commercial services. The 2024 i-SOON GitHub leak revealed automated scripts for domain provisioning and ProtonMail-based OPSEC wrappers, capabilities that [Salt Typhoon](https://dti.domaintools.com/inside-salt-typhoon-chinas-state-corporate-advanced-persistent-threat/) continues to employ. Security agencies now advise that proactive monitoring of passive DNS data, SSL certificate patterns, and registrant overlaps is essential for early warning. Telecom operators should enforce multi-factor authentication for all administrative interfaces, restrict remote management to isolated networks, and rigorously audit firmware integrity on edge devices to detect unauthorized implants. Salt Typhoon’s contractor-driven, dual-use espionage model represents the next evolution in China’s offensive cyber strategy, blending state-directed objectives with commercial execution to achieve scalable, deniable operations. While their semi-industrialized approach yields occasional OPSEC lapses, the group’s advanced capabilities in firmware persistence and metadata harvesting underscore the urgent need for telecom providers to adopt robust [endpoint security](https://cyberpress.org/endpoint-security/) and continuous threat hunting to counter this sophisticated SIGINT threat. ## **Indicator of Compromise (IOCs) – Salt Typhoon Telco Campaigns** ### **Name Server Hosts/IPs:** - irdns.mars.orderbox-dns.com - ns4.1domainregistry.com - ns1.value-domain.com - earth.monovm.com, mars.monovm.com **IP Cluster**: - 162.251.82.125, 162.251.82.252, 172.64.53.3 ### **SSL Certificate Indicators:** - **Common Names (CN)**: - \\*.myorderbox.com - www.solveblemten.com - **Issuers**: - GoDaddy Secure CA – G2 - Sectigo RSA DV CA **Find this Story Interesting!

Rizvi\\] Pakistan has been severely affected in recent weeks by devastating monsoon floods, with over 800 lives lost and millions of people affected. While the floods have impacted all four of Pakistan’s provinces, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab have been hit particularly hard, suffering high casualties. Punjab has experienced the most severe flooding, even as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has experienced the highest death toll. The floods are the worst since 2022, when 8 million people were forced from their homes and 2 million dwellings were destroyed. The current floods have also affected India, especially its Punjab state. More than 350,000 people across 1,400 Indian villages have been rendered homeless, with 46 deaths reported. As in 2022, the flood waters have caused significant damage to crops, livestock, schools, health facilities and critical infrastructure such as bridges, roads and power grids. The disaster has been compounded by Glacier Lake Outburst Floods, related to the rising temperatures and extreme weather events associated with climate change, in the remote Gilgit-Baltistan region. Health services in the flood-affected areas are overwhelmed by rising cases of diseases such as malaria, skin infections and fever. Many communities remain isolated due to blocked or damaged roads, making it difficult to deliver aid to vulnerable populations. With monsoon rains expected to persist, the situation threatens to grow still worse. Floodwaters are projected to pour into the Indus River, threatening large areas in Pakistan’s southern Sindh province. In Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, more than 3.3 million people across 33,000 villages have been directly affected by the flooding. Since the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers—tributaries of the Indus River—overflowed their banks two weeks ago, flooding has affected 3,900 villages in Muzaffargarh District, one of Punjab’s worst-hit areas. Last Thursday, as the flood threat mounted in Pakistan’s Punjab province, officials claimed more than half a million people had been relocated in the previous 24 hours. Thousands of rescuers using boats are taking part in the relief and rescue operations, while tens of thousands have sought refuge in relief camps. Conditions in the camps are described as dire. According to an _Al Jazeera_ report published last Wednesday, a displaced homeowner named Malik Ramzan preferred to stay near his waterlogged home rather than enter a relief camp because they lack basic utilities. “‘Food isn’t delivered on time, and we are treated like beggars,’ said Ramzan.” According to the report, the camps’ facilities “are very poor, with no clean drinking water, no proper toilet facilities, plus the fact that it’s very hot and humid,” contributing to dehydration. All of this adds to the threat of an epidemic of waterborne infections. Marriyum Aurangzeb, who holds multiple portfolios in Punjab’s Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) government, including Planning & Development and Environment Protection and Climate Change, told a press conference August 31, “This is the biggest flood in the history of the Punjab. It’s the first time that the three rivers—Sutlej, Chenab, and Ravi—have carried such high levels of water.” With a population of about 128 million, Punjab is Pakistan’s agricultural hub and its principal wheat producer. Muhammad Amjad, 45, a rice and potato farmer in Chiniot told Reuters on September 1, “Thirteen of my 15 acres are gone, and our rice is completely destroyed. Women and children have evacuated. Men are left guarding what remains.” Some have lost their only source of income. Amish Sultan, 50, said: “I have 10 buffaloes. They’re so weak there’s no milk left for my children, let alone to sell. I used to earn 100,000 to 150,000 rupees a month. That stability is gone.” Pakistani authorities have responded lethargically to the disaster, revealing yet again their indifference and disregard for the lives of workers and the rural poor. Although major floods are occurring ever more frequently, successive governments at the national and provincial level have done next to nothing to improve Indus Valley watershed control measures. The [2022 Pakistan floods](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/08/31/mgah-a31.html) were among the deadliest and most extensive in the country’s history, affecting around 33 million people and displacing over 8 million. The floods killed more than 1,700, caused economic losses exceeding $30 billion and contributed to an eight-percentage point rise between 2020 and 2024, from 17.1 percent to 25.3 percent in the proportion of Pakistanis living in poverty. In [2010, floods](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2010/08/paki-a17.html) similarly devastated Pakistan, killing nearly 2,000 people, affecting about 20 million, and triggering a major humanitarian crisis. Showing the government’s complete unpreparedness, Wasim Hamad Sindhu, the deputy commissioner in Multan, a major city along the eastern bank of the Chenab River in Punjab, said, “The water is coming in large quantities—we cannot fight it; we cannot stop it.” While ignoring the flood preparations needed to save the lives and livelihoods of working people, the Pakistani government has prioritized military spending. It recently announced a 20 percent increase in the defense budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year, raising it to 2.55 trillion rupees ($9 billion). Indian media has reported that in recent weeks, New Delhi has given Islamabad three flood warnings via diplomatic channels as a “humanitarian gesture,” despite it having suspended India’s participation in the Indus Water Treaty (IWT). The 65-year-old treaty was suspended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu supremacist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government as part of their bellicose response to an April 22 terrorist attack in Indian-held Kashmir, which killed 26 tourists. While Pakistan denied any involvement in the attack and called for an international investigation, [India declared Islamabad](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/04/25/adhp-a25.html) responsible. On May 7, it launched missile strikes deep inside Pakistan, triggering a four-day cross-border war that brought the two nuclear-armed nations to the brink of [all-out war](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/05/12/ewmf-m12.html). Pakistani officials are alleging that New Delhi’s failure to pass them information about water levels in the Indus River’s tributaries quickly enough and in sufficient detail have crippled their flood control efforts. Pakistan’s Planning Minister, Ahsan Iqbal, told Reuters, “We could have managed better if we had better information.” The floodwaters’ breach of two barrage gates on the Ramjit River has also led to suggestions India may have deliberately exacerbated the crisis. New Delhi has emphatically denied this, saying surging water broke the barrages and that it is now trying to control water flow further upstream via the Ranjit Sagar Dam. Whatever New Delhi says, if the IWT were still in active operation, it would ensure close collaboration and continuous information exchange between India and Pakistan in the face of surging water levels that threaten lives and livelihoods in both countries. The now suspended Permanent Indus Commission, composed of commissioners from both countries, provided for the regular sharing of data and discussion of water management issues. This information exchange has in the past helped to manage the Indus’ water levels—for flood prevention, irrigation and electrical-power generation—even under tense situations. Although India and Pakistan came to a shaky truce on May 10, India has continued its suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, and both Modi and his chief henchman, Home Minister Amit Shah, have repeatedly vowed that New Delhi will not return to it, without—at the very least—a renegotiation to make it more favorable to India. Threats against Pakistan and boasts of India’s military prowess were key themes of Modi’s August 15 Independence Day address. From Delhi’s Red Fort, he declared India had achieved a great victory in Operation Sindoor—its illegal, four-day aerial war in Pakistan; proclaimed that India will henceforth make no distinction between “those who nurture and harbor terrorism, and those who empower terrorists”; and vowed India will not be intimidated by “nuclear blackmail.” That is, it will aggressively pursue its interests, even at the risk of provoking all-out war. This was combined with the declaration that the Indus Water Treaty is effectively dead. Modi called the treaty “unjust,” and proclaimed “India’s waters belong to India, and India’s farmers. Nobody can take away our waters.” Further underlining India’s bellicose intentions, Modi declared, “Blood and water cannot flow together.” Acting on a complaint from Pakistan, the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), found in a ruling issued August 8 that India cannot unilaterally suspend or hold the Indus Water Treaty “in abeyance.” It also reaffirmed, per the 1960 treaty, Pakistan’s right to the unrestricted use of waters from the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers—collectively known as the western rivers. Pakistan is highly reliant on these rivers, which originate in China but run through Indian-held Kashmir, for both irrigation and power generation. India, affirmed the PCA ruling, must allow these waters to flow as per the treaty’s terms and cannot pursue hydroelectric projects based on its own interpretation of “ideal” engineering practices. New Delhi has angrily rejected all of this, insisting that India is acting in its national security interests and has never agreed to the PCA’s jurisdiction. Foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal asserted that New Delhi has “never accepted the legality, legitimacy, or competence” of the PCA in this matter—making clear that the Modi government is adamant in pressing forward even in the face of bellicose warnings from Pakistan’s government and military that India’s attempt to use the headwaters of the Indus to throttle Pakistan’s economy will end in war. These developments underscore the completely reactionary nature of the 1947 communal partition of then British India into an avowedly Muslim Pakistan and a Hindu India. Any rational solution to the floods and to water distribution—problems that are becoming ever more acute due to rising temperatures, drought and other impacts of climate change—require subcontinent-wide planning, which is rendered impossible by the geopolitical rivalry between India and Pakistan’s venal capitalist elites. Tensions between India and Pakistan remain on the boil as both countries extend bans on commercial flights in each other’s airspace until September 24, first imposed after the April 22 attack in Pahalgam. Meanwhile, the arms race is intensifying. On August 20, India successfully test-fired the Agni-V, an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of carrying over 1,000 kg of nuclear or conventional payloads across 5,000 km at hypersonic speeds near 30,000 km/h. This development came exactly one week after Pakistan announced the formation of a new Army Rocket Force Command to address “strategic gaps,” in particular its ability to “strike the enemy from every direction,” before resorting to tactical and strategic nuclear weapons. The two countries exchanged verbal attacks during last week’s meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Targeting Pakistan without mentioning it by name, Modi vowed that India would never rest until “terrorism” was eradicated, adding that the Pahalgam attack “was not just an assault on India’s soul, but also a challenge to those who believe in humanity.” Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, speaking in the same session, said, “We expect SCO member countries to follow all bilateral treaties,” including “uninterrupted access to due share of water as per existing treaties.” # Read more - [India’s suspension of Indus Waters Treaty escalates threat of all-out war with Pakistan](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/05/09/fwji-m09.html) 9 May 2025 - [India-Pakistan conflict threatens nuclear catastrophe](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/05/12/ewmf-m12.html) 11 May 2025 - [Modi government accelerates violent expulsion of impoverished Muslim refugees](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/06/23/mpfw-j23.html) 23 June 2025 - [Climate-change driven floods ravage Pakistan, killing more than 1,100 and threatening millions with hunger and disease](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/08/31/mgah-a31.html) 30 August 2022 - [Glacier collapse in Blatten, Switzerland—A portent of an ecological catastrophe](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/05/31/ftxz-m31.html) 30 May 2025 [Contact us](https://www.wsws.org/en/special/pages/contact.html) Related Topics Find out more about these topics: [Pakistan](https://www.wsws.org/en/topics/country/as-pak) [India](https://www.wsws.org/en/topics/country/as-ind) [South Asia](https://www.wsws.org/en/topics/region/southern-asia) [Asia and the Pacific](https://www.wsws.org/en/topics/continent/asia) [Floods](https://www.wsws.org/en/topics/environmentCategory/floods) [Climate change](https://www.wsws.org/en/topics/scienceCategory/sc-clim) Loading",

The International Energy Agency did not mince its words when, in February this year, it laid out the stark challenges facing electricity systems around the world. Global annual investment in [power](https://www.ft.com/electric-power) transmission alone will need to more than double, from about $140bn in 2023 to as high as $300bn in the mid-2030s, if the world is to meet rising demand for power and emissions reduction targets. “Around 1.5mn kilometres of new transmission lines have been built worldwide over the last decade, but inadequate transmission remains a major constraint on power system development, electrification and energy security,” say IEA analysts. China, which has a large and growing industry of electricity equipment and hardware suppliers, is well positioned to capitalise on the sorry state of the world’s electricity transmission system, analysts say. As if to make the IEA’s point, two months on, in late April, [Spain suffered a day-long blackout](https://www.ft.com/content/d790af03-8681-432d-88c8-ed7e980fcf85) that cut power across everything from telecoms and internet networks to businesses and rail systems, with disruptions also hitting neighbouring Portugal. For governments around the world, the outage emphasised the need to address under-investment in electricity networks. This is viewed as necessary to meet not only rising demand for artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and data centres, but also the changing landscape of electricity generation from legacy systems powered by large-scale fossil fuel plants to dynamic and weather-dependent systems using increasing amounts of solar and wind. But the urgent need to modernise the world’s electricity grids, from poles and wires to the sophisticated software for dispatching power at the right place and time, has also highlighted the likely need to work closely with Chinese manufacturers that have found themselves at the forefront of an industry plagued with supply shortages. The Iberian blackout was “just the tip of the iceberg”, says Alicia García-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis, given that the Spanish grid was not in the worst condition compared with other transmission systems in Europe. “This is going to hit everybody.” With western manufacturers unable to keep pace with demand, China is now poised to make power equipment a “hugely profitable export market”, adds García-Herrero. According to Ken Liu, head of China renewables, utilities and energy research at UBS, supply of gas turbines and large power transformers face “severe” bottlenecks globally. Turbines, which have become key to powering AI data centres, now have a lead time of more than three years, from about 18 months normally. While planned levels of transformer manufacturing will only meet half of new demand just from Europe and the US. Global demand for distribution transformers — used to step down high-voltage electricity from a power grid to flow into factories, businesses, data centres or residential areas — is likewise expected to remain robust, Liu says, and in excess of what some of the leading western manufacturers have forecast. The IEA has also noted that lead times for direct current cables, used for long-distance transmission lines, extend beyond five years while the price of cables has also nearly doubled since 2019. “The combination of rising component costs, extended procurement lead times, and a significant backlog of orders is contributing to higher project expenses as well as delays,” the agency says in its February report. China is racing against time to avoid blackouts of its own. The country of 1.4bn people is in the middle of a significant [move to decarbonise](https://www.ft.com/content/f86782fa-9f2e-448a-b710-29e787dc9831) its economy, in part via the electrification of the transport and manufacturing sectors. Beijing is sharply increasing spending across the sector. State Grid, which is responsible for about three-quarters of the country’s electricity transmission, for example, plans record spending of Rmb650bn ($89bn) this year alone. But compounding the challenges for China has been power consumption beating forecasts and hitting record highs this year, with increases across the services and industrial sectors as well as from residential demand. “Transmission and distribution, both, are in tough states,” says David Fishman, a Shanghai-based China power sector expert at The Lantau Group, a consultancy. “They are still behind, and I imagine they’ll stay sprinting just to stop falling further behind,” he added. UBS analysts, however, are upbeat on the prospects for a clutch of Chinese manufacturers to benefit from strong export growth including turbine maker Yingliu, and Sieyuan and Sanxing, leading producers of transformers and other power sector equipment. And Fishman was confident that Chinese power equipment manufacturers would be well placed to overcome any current shortfalls in production to meet rising global demand. “As long as the IP \\[intellectual property\\] is Chinese and the barrier is scaling up, then there is no barrier, because that is what China does very well,” he added. The prospect of more and more Chinese-made equipment in grids around the world poses national security risks linked to economic dependence as well as espionage and military threats, western analysts have said. García-Herrero of Natixis expects that while the prospect of more reliance on China will provoke debate in some countries, ultimately nations will need to prioritise shoring up their electricity systems. “It is just how bad the situation is. I’m sure there will be threats from the geopolitical side. But the grid is just so important. Look at what happened to Spain.” [Reuse this content (opens in new window)](https://enterprise.ft.com/en-gb/services/republishing/republish-content-request?ft-content-uuid=49358a6c-7080-44f1-8846-c206a94fd2eb) [CommentsJump to comments section](https://www.ft.com/www.ft.com#comments-anchor) ## Promoted Content ## Explore the series READ MORE [The electrification of everything](https://www.ft.com/reports/electrification) [China poised to benefit as blackout risk rises from Iberia to Siberia](https://www.ft.com/content/49358a6c-7080-44f1-8846-c206a94fd2eb) - [Currently reading:\\ \\ China poised to benefit as blackout risk rises from Iberia to Siberia](https://www.ft.com/content/49358a6c-7080-44f1-8846-c206a94fd2eb) - [Growth of renewable energy heralds the rise of supercables](https://www.ft.com/content/db0a6697-c120-4f72-b876-e7bbc6e1e6e9) - [The reshaping of energy consumption](https://www.ft.com/content/d857c3f0-f23a-4b41-8e12-f6b2014b8ec8) ## Follow the topics in this article - [Electric power](https://www.ft.com/electric-power) Add to myFT - [Renewable energy](https://www.ft.com/renewable-energy) Add to myFT - [Energy crisis](https://www.ft.com/energy-crisis) Add to myFT - [Utilities](https://www.ft.com/utilities) Add to myFT - [Chinese business & finance](https://www.ft.com/chinese-business-finance) Add to myFT ## Comments Close side navigation menu Search the FTSearch [Subscribe for full access](https://www.ft.com/products?segmentId=4526c036-7527-ab37-9a29-0b0403fa0b5f)",

America’s power grid is straining under the weight of a fast-changing energy landscape. Beyond the usual summer hum of air conditioners, power demand is surging from electric vehicle chargers and sprawling new data centers. At the same time, the infrastructure built to deliver reliable electricity is aging and showing its limits. From Texas heatwaves to California blackouts, the warning signs are impossible to ignore. This isn’t a technical challenge—it’s an economic and political reckoning. If the grid fails, it won’t be because we lacked solutions. It will be because we didn’t act quickly enough. ## **A Demand Surge Few Anticipated** For nearly two decades, U.S. electricity demand was flat. Now, consumption is climbing, driven by technologies that arrived faster than planners expected. Artificial intelligence has unleashed a wave of data center construction. These facilities, dense with high-performance servers and cooling systems, are among the most power-hungry assets in the country. In 2023, AI data centers consumed about [4.4% of U.S. electricity](https://iee.psu.edu/news/blog/why-ai-uses-so-much-energy-and-what-we-can-do-about-it), and that share could triple by 2028, according to Penn State’s Institute of Energy and the Environment. Northern Virginia—“Data Center Alley”— [now handles 70% of global internet traffic](https://oxfordamerican.org/oa-now/how-data-center-alley-is-changing-northern-virginia), pushing utilities like Dominion Energy to scramble for capacity. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google warn that a shortage of skilled electricians could delay expansion, with estimates that the U.S. will need [500,000 more electricians](https://www.ciphernews.com/hot-take/500000-electricians/) in the next decade. Electric vehicles, heat pumps, and electrified industry are adding further strain. The Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee projects growth [equivalent to seven Seattle-sized cities](https://www.nwcouncil.org/fs/18720/2024_05_3.pdf) within ten years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. electricity sales to rise from [4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/elec_coal_renew.php), with similar gains to follow. And finally, there’s climate. As extreme heat events multiply, cooling demand in places like Texas and Arizona is surging—driving peak loads to new records. ## **The Supply Gap: Retirements Outpace Replacement** Just as demand is accelerating, the U.S. is retiring some of its most dependable sources of power. [The EIA projects](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64604) 12.3 gigawatts (GW) of capacity will retire in 2025, a 65% jump over 2024. That includes 8.1 GW of coal, such as the 1,800-MW Intermountain Power Project in Utah, plus another 2.6 GW of natural gas. These plants provide round-the-clock power that intermittent sources cannot yet replace. Wind and solar capacity continue to grow, but not fast enough. The Department of Energy’s July 2025 [Resource Adequacy Report](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/DOE%20Final%20EO%20Report%20%28FINAL%20JULY%207%29_0.pdf) warns that only 22 GW of firm generation is expected by 2030—well short of the 104 GW needed for peak demand. Transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays, and slow adoption of long-duration storage compound the problem. Grid operators from PJM, MISO, ERCOT, and others [told Congress bluntly](https://www.powermag.com/nations-power-operators-warn-congress-of-a-coming-reliability-shortfall/) in March 2025: “Demand is accelerating, supply is lagging, and current tools may not be enough to bridge the gap.” ## **Growing Vulnerabilities: Weather, Cyber, and Sabotage** Beyond the supply-demand imbalance, the grid faces mounting risks. Heatwaves, wildfires, and storms are stressing transmission systems nationwide. Events once considered rare—like the 2003 Northeast blackout that hit 50 million people—are now seen as precursors of larger disruptions. As smart grids and distributed resources proliferate, so do digital entry points for hackers. In 2024, [DOE funded 16 cybersecurity projects](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/department-energy-awards-42-million-guard-power-grid-cyber-threats), including Georgia Tech’s AI-based “DerGuard” system to monitor risks in distributed energy. Sabotage at substations and transmission lines is also rising. With more than 160,000 miles of high-voltage lines and 7,300 plants, much of it decades old, the system is a sprawling, exposed target. [Homeland Security now classifies grid protection](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors) alongside nuclear and water infrastructure. ## **Policy Gridlock and Infrastructure Delays** Despite the alarms, policy responses remain sluggish. Jurisdiction is a big part of the problem. Regional transmission operators manage the grid but don’t own generation or lines. Utilities do, while states control siting and permitting. The result is a patchwork that slows progress. As of mid-2024, transmission projects across the U.S. [faced delays](https://www.wapa.gov/supply-chains/) of five to seven years due to permitting hurdles, interconnection bottlenecks, and supply chain constraints. By mid-2025, lead times for large power transformers had stretched beyond 30 months, with some units requiring up to four years for delivery—posing serious risks to grid reliability and expansion. Even bipartisan efforts like the [CIRCUIT Act](https://www.maddox.com/resources/articles/circuit-act)—introduced in February 2025 to incentivize domestic transformer production through a 10% tax credit—remain stalled in committee, despite widespread industry support and urgent supply chain concerns. Meanwhile, subsidies continue to favor intermittent renewables over firm capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act accelerated clean energy deployment, but without parallel investment in balancing technologies, reliability risks grow. ## **What’s Being Done** Federal and private efforts are ramping up, though often as short-term fixes. DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants and issued reliability directives under the Federal Power Act. These measures keep the lights on but do little to build long-term resilience. DOE also aims to increase long-distance capacity 16% by 2030, adding 7,500 miles of new lines. But permitting delays and local resistance remain obstacles. In 2025, [DOE launched $32 million](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/01/15/us-doe-invests-32-million-for-grid-edge-technology-and-smart-charge-management/) in pilot projects for smart EV charging, responsive buildings, and distributed energy integration. These solutions could eventually scale, but utilities and regulators must buy in. ## **Investor Implications: Reliability as a Premium** For investors, grid instability is a risk, but also an opportunity. Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion, and Avangrid are investing billions in grid modernization and diversified generation. Avangrid alone plans $20 billion through 2030 across 23 states. Independent power producers are also benefiting from the shifting landscape. NRG Energy, one of the nation’s largest competitive power suppliers, has seen its shares climb sharply as rising demand boosts wholesale electricity prices. Unlike regulated utilities, NRG and its peers compete in deregulated markets, where higher load growth and tighter capacity directly translate into stronger margins. That dynamic could make competitive generators an overlooked winner in a strained grid environment. Firms like Fluence, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are seeing growing demand for storage and microgrid solutions. Pilot programs backed by DOE may open new markets for software-driven load management. With coal exiting and renewables constrained, power generated by nuclear energy and natural gas retain a “reliability premium.” [Deloitte estimates](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/power-and-utilities/funding-growth-in-us-power-sector.html) the U.S. power sector will need $1.4 trillion in new capital between 2025 and 2030, with similar levels required through 2050. Firms able to supply firm generation or grid services stand to benefit. ## **Conclusion: Crisis or Course Correction?** The U.S. power grid isn’t collapsing—but it is under pressure like never before. Demand growth, baseload retirements, extreme weather, and policy paralysis are colliding to create a fragile system. Whether this moment becomes a crisis or a correction depends on how quickly policymakers, utilities, and investors adapt. The tools exist—firm generation, smart load management, and modern transmission. But without faster coordination and realistic incentives, the U.S. risks trading energy abundance for energy fragility.

Wikimedia Commons A map of the India- China border in Ladakh, depicting the 1956 and 1960 claim lines of China, as well as lines of actual control before and after the 1962 Sino-Indian War. Wikimedia Commons [Sushant Singh](https://caravanmagazine.in/author/sushant-singh) 30 September, 2022 **FOR THE FIRST TIME** in forty-five years, on 15 June 2020, India and China recorded the death of Indian soldiers on the Line of Actual Control—the contested border between the two countries, which stretches from the Karakoram Pass in the west to Myanmar in the east. The deaths occurred in the Galwan Valley, in Ladakh, and these were the first military casualties in the territory since the 1962 Sino-India War. The full details of the incident are shrouded in ambiguity, but it involved Chinese soldiers pitching tents around the Galwan Valley and their forceful eviction by the Indian Army—there is little clarity on whether China’s People’s Liberation Army had agreed to abandon these positions. This led to a clash which claimed the lives of 20 Indian soldiers and at least four PLA soldiers. More than seventy Indian soldiers were injured while nearly a hundred more, including some officers, were taken captive by the Chinese. No Chinese soldier was in Indian captivity. “We were taken by surprise by how well prepared they were for the clash,” a top officer at the army headquarters in Delhi, who was part of the decision-making in the Ladakh crisis, told me. The LAC has neither been delineated on the map nor demarcated on the ground by either side. The last attempt to do so failed nearly two decades ago. The difference in the two sides’ understanding of it is so vast that New Delhi claims the border between the two countries is 3,488 kilometres long while China says it is only around two thousand. It is the world’s longest disputed border. As the two countries do not agree on where the “actual control” exercised by either side ends, both are engaged in an uncompromising contest of asserting control over small parcels of land in a desolate Himalayan wasteland. The demonstration of territorial claims can take several forms, including soldiers patrolling up to certain points, building infrastructure along the border and controlling the limits to which people in border villages are allowed to graze their animals. The unforgiving terrain and harsh weather have not dissuaded India and China from deploying around fifty thousand additional soldiers each on the 832-kilometre LAC in Ladakh since the summer of 2020. The deadly Galwan clash occurred at patrolling point PP14—an area that was not until then disputed, and which the Indian Army patrolled regularly. Days after it, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared in Delhi that the Chinese had not “intruded into our border, nor has any post been taken over by them”—an attempt at saving face that China gleefully seized upon as proof that it had not encroached upon Indian territory. The clamour around the deaths and the release of captive Indian soldiers, however, had blown the lid off the government’s attempts to play down the crisis in Ladakh. The situation had already come to public notice in India a month earlier because of massive physical clashes on the north bank of Pangong Lake, also in Ladakh. There were severe injuries on both sides, but no deaths. These major episodes marked the border crisis of the summer of 2020, even though tension had been building for months before that. Two and a half years later, the state of ties between the two neighbours can be aptly described as “No War, No Peace.” This was an expression used by military officers more than two decades ago to describe the situation on the border in the restive Kashmir region between India and Pakistan—the Line of Control. The two situations are materially different, but the terminology makes a connection that was pointed out to me by a senior Indian military commander who was involved in handling the Ladakh crisis. When I asked him about the thinking that impelled military actions leading into the crisis in the summer of 2020, he said, “Do not treat China on the LAC like Pakistan on the LoC.”",

While the two sides have not engaged in significant cross-border clashes since 2020, they are maintaining large troop deployments, and sporadic encounters between opposing forces risk miscalculation and escalation into armed conflict,” states the annual threat assessment of the US intelligence community, released by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on Monday, as it talks about potential inter-state conflicts. The report highlights a fragile global order, China’s military expansion plans, its aggressive cyber operations and its possible attempt to influence the 2024 US presidential elections. It further talks about other conflicts including the Israel-Hamas war and the Russia-Ukraine war. Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week inaugurated the strategic Sela tunnel, built at an altitude of 13,000 feet in Arunachal Pradesh, that will provide all-weather connectivity to Tawang. Infrastructure projects near Indo-China border have gathered pace since a military standoff with China in Ladakh sector of the [Line of Actual Control](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-stern-warning-to-india-on-deploying-more-border-troops-won-t-ease-tensions-101709890661820.html)(LAC) began in May 2020. Both sides have arrayed close to 50,000 troops each in Ladakh sector and India has made it clear that bilateral relations cannot be normalised till there is peace and tranquility in the border areas. The report also points to possible armed conflict between India and Pakistan as well in case of any provocations from Islamabad. “New Delhi and Islamabad are inclined to sustain the current fragile calm in their relationship following their renewal of a cease-fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in early 2021. However, neither side has used this period of calm to rebuild their bilateral ties as each government has focused on more pressing domestic priorities including election perpetrations and campaigning and for Pakistan, concerns over rising militant attacks in its west,” the report underscores. “Pakistan’s long history of supporting anti-India militant groups and India’s increased willingness, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to respond with military force to perceived or real Pakistani provocations raise the risk of escalation during a crisis. There remains the potential for an event to trigger a rapid escalation,” it added. On China’s plans to create overseas bases in India’s neighbourhood and other areas, the report states that the [People’s Liberation Army (PLA)](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/view-se-la-tunnel-will-allow-faster-indian-response-in-case-of-chinese-aggression-101709984264115.html) will “continue to pursue the establishment of overseas military installations and access agreements in an attempt to project power and protect China’s interests abroad”. “Beyond developing its military base in Djibouti and its military facility at Ream Naval base in Cambodia, Beijing reportedly is considering pursuing military facilities in multiple locations, including—but not limited to—Burma, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Pakistan, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Tanzania, and the UAE,” it says. The report notes that Beijing will focus on building a fully modernized national defense and military force by 2035 and for the PLA to become a world-class military by 2049. “In the meantime, the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) hopes to use the PLA to secure what it claims is its sovereign territory, to assert its preeminence in regional affairs, and to project power globally, particularly by being able to deter and counter an intervention by the United States in a cross-Strait conflict”, it adds.

The island-wide outage, which hit just after 9am local time on Wednesday, is believed to be linked to a malfunction at one of Cuba’s largest thermoelectric plants, the Ministry of Energy and Mines said. ## Recommended Stories list of 4 items - list 1 of 4 [Cuba restores power grid but planned outages to resume amid energy crisis](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/5/cuba-restores-power-grid-but-planned-outages-to-resume-amid-energy-crisis) - list 2 of 4 [Cuba forced to ‘paralyse economy’ amid desperate energy crisis](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/18/cuba-forced-to-paralyse-economy-amid-desperate-energy-crisis) - list 3 of 4 [Photos: Cuba struggles to get energy grid back online after blackout](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/10/19/cuba-struggles-to-get-energy-grid-back-online-after-nationwide-blackout) - list 4 of 4 [Cuba extends workplace, school shutdowns in wake of power blackouts](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/23/cuba-extends-workplace-school-shutdowns-in-wake-of-power-blackouts) end of list The ministry said crews had been dispatched to build a microsystem capable of providing basic services, and were prioritising the return of electricity to essential sites such as hospitals and food production plants. On Thursday, the national electricity company said power was restored to 11 of Cuba’s 15 provinces. The Cuban Electric Union said on X that 79.4 percent of households in the capital Havana have electricity again after a blackout that lasted nearly 24 hours. “The SEN (National Electric System) has been reconnected, with restoration still pending” in four provinces, the company added. Earlier, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero also made an appearance on state TV at Cuba’s state-run power company, asking Cubans for their trust and promising that electricity would be restored gradually. Cuba’s worsening economic and energy crisis has led to repeated daily blackouts and full grid outages. In March, a [breakdown](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/15/huge-power-outage-in-cuba-leaves-millions-in-darkness) at a substation in Havana led to rolling blackouts across the island, with three more blackouts [occurring](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/4/millions-without-power-as-cuba-hit-by-another-nationwide-blackout) late last year. Across Havana on Wednesday, traffic lights were down as people scurried around to buy groceries and basic goods before dark. Pumps supplying the capital’s apartments with water rely on electricity. Havana resident Danai Hernandez [told](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2025/9/10/cuba-hit-with-fifth-nationwide-blackout-in-less-than-a-year#flips-6379047661112:0) Al Jazeera she had left work to prepare her home for the blackout. “We just have to wait. There’s no other choice,” she said. “We’re cooking with wood and charcoal, so we have to adjust our schedules,” resident Ernesto Gutierrez told Al Jazeera. “It’s complicated, stressful, and frustrating, too.” Cuba’s energy supply crisis has deteriorated in recent years because of US sanctions, which prevent it from holding sufficient foreign currency to upgrade or repair fast-ageing plants that have been in use for more than three decades. Havana has tried to fill the gap by renting floating Turkish power ships and installing Chinese-funded solar parks. Some wealthier families have installed rechargeable devices and solar panels in their homes. Still, the blackouts have prompted rare [protests](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/18/cuba-hundreds-protest-long-blackouts-tight-economy), with crowds flooding the second-largest city of Santiago last year.",

This year, a leading engineering society [graded](https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/civil-engineering-magazine/issues/magazine-issue/article/2025/05/the-urgent-need-for-energy-infrastructure-improvements) the country’s energy system a D+; 70 percent of transmission lines are more than 25 years old, 55 percent of transformers are near end of life, and the average lead time for new transformers is over a year. On top of all that, hotter and more frequent heat waves are degrading the grid. Despite these deficiencies, new demands are being made of the system, from massive new “hyperscale” data centers and more electric vehicle charging stations to the onshoring of manufacturing. Additionally, as temperatures rise and cyberattacks boosted by artificial intelligence (AI) become more potent, the United States needs to invest in a more resilient grid—or risk an energy insecure future. #### Past and future risks to grid reliability Threats to electricity systems include many new and evolving digital and physical risks to companies, cities, and individuals, including disruptions to technological and communications services. On the physical side, floods, fires, and extreme heat events, which are [increasingly posing physical threats](https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/weather-related-power-outages-rising) to energy infrastructure. Digital threats come in the form of ransomware and other cyberattacks, and sometimes arise simply out of the enormous complexity of today’s systems. For example, the [2024 CrowdStrike disruption](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/delta-crowdstrike-global-it-outage-explained)—which was caused by a faulty software update that crashed Windows systems worldwide—affected US Department of Energysystems as well as those at a number of [electric utilities](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/power-grid/outage-management/widespread-technology-outage-disrupts-flights-banks-media-outlets-and-companies-around-the-world/), and stranded or otherwise impacted 1.3 million airline passengers. When these events occur, disruptions to commerce and society follow and highlight the obligations that infrastructure planners and defenders have to limit harm from such incidents—obligations that simply cannot be deferred. And yet, upgrades to some of the most important parts of US critical infrastructure arebeing deferred. Today, on average, large US grid transformers, which are essential to electricity reliability, are [past their designed lifespan](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/EXEC-2022-001242%20-%20Large%20Power%20Transformer%20Resilience%20Report%20signed%20by%20Secretary%20Granholm%20on%207-10-24.pdf), and the backlog for replacements is [often three years or more](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/reshore-electrical-equipment-backlogs-transformer-breaker-nema/749265/). Grid operators—and all who depend on the grid—are forced to rely on this old equipment. Meanwhile, [rising temperatures are aging grid components faster](https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/topics-and-risk-dialogues/climate-and-natural-catastrophe-risk/impact-of-climate-on-electric-grids.html#:~:text=Global%20warming%20projections%20of%202,(%3E%204%C2%B0C)) by increasing chemical and mechanical stress on them, which leads to reduced efficiency, faster degradation, and increased failure rates. In addition to these long-standing challenges, three major trends have recently emerged that place additional pressure on the electric system: electricity-hungry, AI-powering data centers; the increasing number of electric vehicles and charging stations; and the electrification of everything, perhaps best represented by [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/heat-pumps-keep-widening-their-lead-on-gas-furnaces) replacing oil and gas-burning furnaces. At the same time, the nation is confronted with operational risks and constraints that US grid managers are struggling mightily to manage, such as how to handle increasing shares of non-dispatchable renewable generation as well as rapid policy changes like executive orders to keep coal plants running and restart shuttered nuclear plants. #### Disruption drives agile solutions There is a way forward, inspired by past grid failures and wartime emergencies. When challenged with disruptions, grid operators have not only responded with agility but also applied lessons learned to greatly reduce the potential for future cascades. The Northeastern blackout of 2003, for example, provided a major wake-up call. It affected [50 million people and cost about $6 billion](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2003-blackout-five-years-later/). While numerous improvements followed, three in particular did much to improve the [US grid’s resilience posture](https://www.energy.gov/oe/articles/blackout-2003-blackout-final-implementation-report) via enhanced communications: the installation by the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Committee (NERC) of a new conference bridge to greatly enhance communications during crises; the creation of a new set of procedures and protocols for reliability coordinator hotline calls; and enhancements to the decentralized system data exchange network with automated hourly uploads of outage data. Another example—a far more devastating one—is Russia’s targeting of energy infrastructure in Ukraine. Under heavy attacks aimed at knocking out civilian infrastructure, Ukrainians, in a show of unity, deployed backup generators and battery packs in unprecedented numbers, adhered to strict schedules for electricity usage set by the utilities, and—as much as possible—decentralized power generation. Although the United States is not at war, the impacts of climate change and cyberattacks could have similar effects on infrastructure and require similar solutions. To address the growing demand for electricity, the United States must generate and deliver much greater quantities of electricity reliably, safely, and securely, all while limiting emissions. Enhanced demand management, as practiced with precision in Ukraine, is one tool that may help. #### Anticipating future challenges The truth is that the US electric system is not operating the way it was designed. That’s because its developers did not anticipate the arrival of such dynamism. Meeting new challenges will require leadership and collective will, and for society to make itself more resilient by preparing in advance for more and longer-duration outages with backup generators and microgrids. To meet the challenges of a future where energy demand keeps rising, warming temperatures place new pressures on critical infrastructure, and cyber criminals threaten to cause massive disruption, the United States must leverage its collective imagination to rally its businesses and citizens to prepare for a less reliable grid. This is accomplished, in part, by full-scale exercises like NERC’s biennial [GridEx](https://www.nerc.com/pa/CI/ESISAC/Pages/GridEx.aspx) series, as well as through regional resilience summits. The property of resilience isn’t required until there is scarcity, a stressor, or other forms of adversity. It comes into play when an entity doesn’t have all that it needs or is under assault, but, by prior preparation, is not defeated. _[Andy Bochman](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) is the senior grid strategist for Idaho National Laboratory’s National and Homeland Security directorate._ ## About the author Former fellow ### [Andy Bochman](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) [Former Nonresident Senior Fellow](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) [Global Energy Center](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/our-programs/global-energy-center/) [Cybersecurity](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/cybersecurity/) [Energy & Environment](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/energy-environment/) ## Stay Connected #### Sign up for PowerPlay, the Atlantic Council’s bimonthly newsletter keeping you up to date on all facets of the energy transition ## related content [EnergySourceAug 28, 2025\\ \\ **Overheated and underbuilt: How to fortify the US grid in the face of heat waves** \\ \\ ByFrank Willey\\ \\ As demand for electricity rises across the United States—and in the Mid-Atlantic in particular—to cool homes and power data center growth, so does its cost.

Over the years, the LAC has sparked standoffs, skirmishes and war between the two expanding nuclear powers. To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh. Despite their enduring differences, India and China largely have managed to keep their border disputes from spilling over into other aspects of their relationship, such as trade.

    "full_text": "Search # Is India being forced closer to China and other BRICS nations by US tarrifs? / MOFA - People's Republic of China By bno Chennai OfficeAugust 22, 2025 India’s economic relationship with China has evolved in uneven but persistent ways since 2005, when both sides agreed that boundary disputes would not obstruct broader cooperation. That principle allowed trade to flourish despite recurring standoffs in Ladakh, Doklam, and Galwan. According to a new report by _Carnegie India_, [bilateral trade](https://www.intellinews.com/india-china-move-to-restart-border-trade-after-five-year-gap-396286/?source=india) grew from $17bn in 2005 to nearly $120bn by 2024, with China becoming India’s largest trading partner and the trade deficit swelling to almost $100bn. Attempts to narrow the gap by boosting Indian exports ran into Chinese non-tariff barriers in pharmaceuticals, IT, and procurement, leaving India structurally dependent on Chinese goods. Through these years, even the most violent clashes along the Line of Actual Control did not dent the trajectory of imports; only global shocks such as the 2008 financial crisis, the 2018 trade war, and the 2020 pandemic briefly slowed the deficit’s rise. Investment flows tell a more complex story. Chinese commitments in manufacturing and infrastructure spiked after 2014, riding Xi Jinping’s outbound investment liberalisation and Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” campaign. According to the _Carnegie India_ report, big-ticket deals, such as Fosun’s acquisition of Gland Pharma, signalled growing comfort with cross-border capital. But momentum was cut short by Beijing’s clampdown on outbound flows in 2016 and India’s abrupt policy pivot in 2020 after Galwan. The introduction of mandatory screening for investments from land-bordering countries effectively shut down new Chinese capital. Venture investment, which had funneled billions into India’s booming internet economy, was also caught in the crossfire. By 2019, nearly two-thirds of India’s unicorns counted Chinese investors, but the subsequent app bans and policy shifts triggered rapid unwinding. What was once a deepening digital partnership was dismantled within half a decade, leaving only a few residual stakes by 2025. Public procurement emerged as another battleground. A July 2020 order barred bidders from border-sharing countries without special clearance, effectively targeting Chinese construction and engineering firms. While this halted new government contracts, ongoing projects continued to generate billions in revenue for Chinese companies, and Indian contractors still relied heavily on Chinese input for railways and power equipment. This contradiction highlighted the limits of punitive procurement policies in a market where domestic substitutes remain underdeveloped. The broader calculus grew even more complicated in 2025 as India’s relationship with the US has hit turbulence during Donald Trump’s second term. Early in the year, both sides announced ambitious trade targets, but optimism soured quickly. Trump imposed steep tariffs on Indian exports under the banner of “reciprocity,” escalating the measures within weeks. He further linked a hike in tariff to penalties on India’s continued imports of discounted Russian oil, casting the issue as one of strategic loyalty. New Delhi dismissed the tariffs as unjustified and bristled at Washington’s attempts to dictate its energy policy. The trade war spilled into defense, with reports of procurement delays feeding speculation about a deeper chill in ties. The friction with Washington also carried political consequences at home. Modi’s government, once keen to frame India as a natural US partner in countering China, now faced a difficult balancing act. Public opinion turned skeptical of the reliability of American commitments, while business lobbies fretted over lost export markets. The sudden reversal in tone from Washington reinforced India’s instinct to hedge, looking beyond its Quad partnership to [options within BRICS](https://www.intellinews.com/the-unintended-consequence-of-trump-s-tariffs-is-pushing-brics-together-396138/?source=india) and other multilateral formats. For Beijing, the cracks in the US-India relationship presented an opening to soften its own posture and explore areas of cooperation despite the lingering shadow of Galwan. Taken together, these dynamics underscore the paradox at the heart of India’s economic statecraft. Trade with China remains indispensable but lopsided. Investment ties can be throttled or revived depending on political calculations. Procurement restrictions reveal dependency even when couched in national security terms. And now, India must contend with an uncertain partner in Washington, where tariff wars and energy disputes have cast doubt on the stability of what was once touted as a defining partnership. The result is an India forced to refine its playbook, seeking flexibility, developing layered tools of retaliation and deterrence, and ensuring that neither neighbor nor ally can dictate the terms of its economic future.

The objective of the program is to help India mitigate the risks and vulnerability of its people to natural disasters, especially cyclones. The first phase is financed through a Credit from the IDA (International Development Association), complemented with **$64 million** from the Government’s budget. India is highly vulnerable to natural hazards, particularly earthquakes, floods, droughts, cyclones and landslides. Studies indicate that natural disaster losses equate up to 2 percent of India’s GDP and up to 12 percent of federal government revenues. About 5,700 kilometers of India’s coastline is exposed to severe cyclones and approximately 40% of India’s population lives within 100 km of the coastline. Analyzed data for the period 1980-2000 indicates that on an average, annually, 370 million people are exposed to cyclones in India. The aim of the project (NCRMP-I) is to improve early warning and communication systems; enhance capacity of local communities to respond to disasters; improve access to emergency shelters, evacuation, and protection against cyclone related hazards such as wind storms, flooding and storm surge in high risk areas; and strengthen disaster risk management capacities at the central, state and local levels. The program is expected to include at least three phases. Phase I includes the states of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Phase II will be open to the remaining high risk states or other coastal states that are ready to join. Rest of the coastal states will be covered under phase III. Each of the new phases will be appraised and approved separately to confirm the implementation readiness. This phased approach will help incorporate lessons from the earlier phases as well as include new ideas and advancements in technology in the management of risks. _“As climate change and variability become more pronounced, hazard events are set to grow, both in terms of frequency and intensity. Globally, the understanding of the role of disaster risk mitigation and preparedness initiatives in reducing the overall impacts of a disaster, has grown,”_ said **N.V.V. Raghava, World Bank Senior Infrastructure Specialist and Project Team Leader.** _“The project aims to mitigate the risks and vulnerability of coastal communities to cyclone and other hydrometeorological hazards by reducing the social, economic and financial impacts of future disasters.”_ India’s response to two of the biggest disasters in this current decade, the Gujarat earthquake and the Asian tsunami, has been efficient and very effective. Through this period, India has made great strides in moving from reactive emergency response to being proactive in implementing disaster preparedness and risk reduction initiatives. India enacted the Disaster Management Act in 2005 and established the National Disaster Management Authority and State Disaster Management Authorities. The credit is provided by the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s concessionary lending arm and has 35 years to maturity and a 10-year grace period. * * * ###### Media Contacts In Delhi Nandita Roy Tel : 91-11-41479220 [nroy@worldbank.org](mailto:nroy@worldbank.org) In Delhi Mohamad Al-Arief Tel : 91-11-41479210 [malarief@worldbank.org](mailto:malarief@worldbank.org) Karina Manasseh Tel : Manasseh [kmanasseh@worldbank.org](mailto:kmanasseh@worldbank.org) * * * ###### RELATED - [India National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (1)](https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P092217?lang=en) * * * * * * - [India](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/india) - [South Asia](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/sar) - [Climate Change](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange) - [Fragility, Conflict and Violence](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/fragilityconflictviolence) Api ![](https://www.worldbank.org/etc/designs/wbr/clientlibs/img/loaderwb.svg) Api ![](https://www.worldbank.org/etc/designs/wbr/clientlibs/img/loaderwb.svg) * * * ###### Newsletters [Welcome](https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/bold-new-worldbankorg)",

This demonstrates how cyber operations have evolved beyond merely gathering intelligence. When first identified by US government partners back in mid-2023, the campaign by the Salt Typhoon group was assessed as a targeted espionage effort against US and allied government systems. It involved stealthy intrusions, selective data theft and probing of networks in a handful of countries. At the time, the effect was thought to be limited and largely confined to government targets. But August 2025 disclosures have shown just how broad the campaign truly has been. The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has [publicly attributed](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/countering-chinese-state-sponsored-actors-compromise-of-networks-worldwide-to-feed-global-espionage-system) the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. They are central to rivalry. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge. The Indo-Pacific is the epicentre of 21st-century competition. China and the US vie for influence, while South Korea, India, Japan and Southeast Asian countries all face mounting digital vulnerabilities. With the digital economy of Southeast Asian nations expected to surpass US$1 [trillion](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/asean-building-trust-digital-economy/) by 2030, growth is driving their prosperity but also compounding risk. Chinese-sponsored hackers have been targeting critical infrastructure for a long time. Suspected Chinese hackers disrupted India’s [port](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/securing-indian-ports-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-and-the-road-ahead) logistics in 2020, and repeated intrusions have targeted Japanese, South Korean and Australian energy grids, telecom systems and government networks. Cyber operations are applied to traditional hotspots—such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait—by threatening disruption without any shots being fired. Beyond the sheer number of cyber incidents, patterns in their objectives distinguish cyber operations in the Indo-Pacific from those in other regions. Three stand out: probing, pressuring, and threshold testing. Probing operations aim to identify and target system vulnerabilities. Chinese threat group APT41 often employs this method. The [group](https://cyberscoop.com/apt41-fireeye-china/) has conducted espionage operations across healthcare, telecoms and government agencies for many years. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has perfected a distinct form of probing: cyber-heists, ranging from the 2016 Bangladesh Bank [hack](https://cyber.uk/areas-of-cyber-security/cyber-security-threat-groups-2/nation-state-hackers-case-study-bangladesh-bank-heist/) to ongoing cryptocurrency thefts that directly fund Pyongyang’s weapons programs. These operations map vulnerabilities and generate funds, while staying below the threshold of conventional war. Australia has been a repeated target of pressuring tactics, with the [breaches](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/reports-and-statistics/annual-cyber-threat-report-2023-2024) of critical infrastructure widely interpreted as signaling that Canberra’s alignment with Washington has costs. Taiwan is another case in point. During its 2024 elections, disinformation campaigns, distributed denial-of-service attacks on government portals, and breaches of media outlets sought to [undermine](https://saferinternetlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Panel-4-Summer.pdf) confidence in the democratic process. These pressures were synchronised with more visible coercion, such as military exercises and air incursions, illustrating how digital operations complement kinetic manoeuvres. Some cyber campaigns appear to be aimed at threshold-testing, blurring the line between espionage and sabotage. In the Vietnam–China cyber [clashes](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/vietnams-securitisation-of-cybersecurity-under-growing-chinese-cyber-threats/) related to South China Sea disputes, Vietnamese hackers allegedly targeted Chinese government websites. Similarly, the 2021 Japan Olympics cyberattacks, which [some](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54600098) attributed to Russian actors, demonstrated how geopolitical rivalries could extend into civilian life. Together, these incidents outline a region where states and non-state actors continually challenge each other’s resolve. Skirmishes might not cause immediate destruction, but they foster digital coercion and raise the risk of escalation. Cyber campaigns are not just harassment; some signal a potential for escalation. Attacks against Taiwan’s government networks have spiked during Chinese military drills, showing how cyber and kinetic tools are increasingly integrated. The danger lies in miscalculation. A ransomware strike that disrupts Japan’s energy grid or South Korea’s financial sector could be interpreted as state-backed aggression, prompting military responses. In cyberspace, where [attribution](https://academic.oup.com/isp/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/isp/ekae022/7903056) is murky and timeframes are compressed, escalation could outrun diplomacy. Repeated incidents also risk normalising cyber coercion as a standard tool of statecraft. If probing and pressure go unchallenged, adversaries will keep pushing until the region faces a full-scale digital confrontation. The Indo-Pacific has become a laboratory for cyber conflict, setting global precedents. Europe, Latin America and Africa should watch closely: today’s coercion in Asia could become tomorrow’s global standard. Cyber skirmishes in the Indo-Pacific mark the cutting edge of strategic competition, where adversaries test limits and normalise coercion. The region’s growing dependence on digital infrastructure, combined with its strategic volatility, makes it a perilous testing ground for cyber conflict globally. The choice is stark: treat these incidents as minor disruptions until one sparks a crisis, or act to strengthen resilience, deepen cooperation and set rules for [responsible](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/curbing-the-cost-of-cybersecurity-fragmentation-an-agenda-for-harmonisation-across-the-indo-pacific/) behaviour in cyberspace. If governments fail, adversaries will decide the thresholds for acceptable action—and by then it may be too late.

    "full_text": "[Cyber](https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/cyber) \\> [Global Weekly Executive Summaries](https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/cyber/category/global-weekly-exec-summary/) \\> China Hacks Telecom Companies # China Hacks Telecom Companies By [Shane Zuls](https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/cyber/author/shaneez/) on December 6, 2024 ## Executive Summary On December 3, 2024, NBC News, a mainstream American broadcast television network, reported that state-sponsored Chinese hackers had attacked major American telecom companies \\[1\\]. The hacking campaign, nicknamed Salt Typhoon by Microsoft, has breached companies like Verizon, AT&T, and Lumen, and hasn’t been fully evicted from networks yet \\[4\\]. Analysts have reported that this could potentially be one of the largest and most egregious cyber espionage campaigns ever in terms of size and scope \\[3\\]. A majority of the information intercepted by the hackers involved either people working for the government or people involved in politics \\[1\\]. Examples of previously targeted individuals include President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris \\[1\\]. ## Background With growing tensions between China and the US over things like trade, military build-up, and Taiwan, China has invested a lot of time and effort into their cybersecurity/cyber espionage military departments. Emphasis has been put on things like intellectual property theft, industrial espionage/sabotage, or in this case information gathering. Since the cyber domain is so new, there is a lack of international regulations or consequences for cyber attacks perpetrated by nation-states, making this domain a great medium for rivaling nations. ## Impact This story is currently ongoing and a formal investigation into the scope of this attack has not been done yet. However, some compromised items include certain records, voice calls, and the wiretap system used by the justice department \\[1\\]. Due to the nature of the companies that have been compromised, the theoretical scope of the attacks could reach almost everybody who uses a phone in the United States. Since the attackers have not yet been removed completely from the networks they have compromised, it is important to note that the scope may increase even further. Other miscellaneous information that has been compromised as a result of the attacks include caller and receiver phone numbers, call durations, call types, and the location of cell towers used \\[4\\]. ## Significance Due to this attack, the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has recommended people to harden their systems and devices, be careful what they communicate, and use encrypted communications when possible \\[1\\] \\[2\\]. This attack shows that while people may secure their own communications through things like tough passwords or two-factor authentication, vendors themselves are also vulnerable to attacks. Consumers should do proper research on their vendors to understand the protections that are put in place to safeguard their data from threats. It is up to the consumer to then determine if they can trust the companies with data that they may find confidential. ## References \\[1\\] Collier K., “U.S. officials urge Americans to use encrypted apps amid unprecedented cyberattack,” 2024 [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna182694](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna182694) \\[2\\] Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, “Enhanced Visibility and Hardening Guidance for Communications Infrastructure,” 2024 [https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure) \\[3\\] Luce D., “Chinese hack of telecommunications companies under investigation, NSA chief says,” 2024 [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chinese-hack-telecommunications-companies-investigation-nsa-chief-says-rcna174208](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chinese-hack-telecommunications-companies-investigation-nsa-chief-says-rcna174208) \\[4\\] Vijayan J., “CISA Issues Guidance to Telecom Sector on Salt Typhoon Threat,” 2024 [https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/cisa-issue-guidance-telecoms-salt-typhoon-threat](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/cisa-issue-guidance-telecoms-salt-typhoon-threat) Related Posts - [Hackers Steal $500,000 from Australian Super Funds\\ Hackers Steal $500,000 from Australian Super Funds\\ 4/11/2025](https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/cyber/global-weekly-exec-summary/hackers-steal-500000-from-australian-super-funds/) - [U.S. Department of Justice Seizes 8.2 Million in Cryptocurrency\\ U.S. Department of Justice Seizes 8.2 Million in Cryptocurrency\\ 4/4/2025](https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/cyber/global-weekly-exec-summary/u-s-department-of-justice-seizes-8-2-million-in-cryptocurrency/) - [Interpol Arrests Over 300 for Cyber Crimes in Africa\\ Interpol Arrests Over 300 for Cyber Crimes in Africa\\ 4/4/2025](https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/cyber/global-weekly-exec-summary/interpol-arrests-over-300-for-cyber-crimes-in-africa/)",

    "full_text": "[Security Bloggers Network](https://securityboulevard.com/category/sbn/) [Threats & Breaches](https://securityboulevard.com/category/blogs/threats-breaches/) [by Matthew Rosenquist on September 27, 2025](https://securityboulevard.com/author/matthew-rosenquist/) China has implemented regulations for 1-hour reporting of severe cybersecurity incidents. This would include disruptions that impact over 50% of the people in a province or 10 million people, such as critical infrastructure attacks. The irony is that China is recognized for its advanced and aggressive foreign cyber operations. But there is brilliance in this requirement. China has an excellent perspective in how such attacks can be used to disrupt adversaries and push foreign policy. It doesn’t want to suffer in ways that other nations might and therefore is improving its response and recovery capabilities. In contrast, when the US SEC required public companies to report material outages within 4 days beginning in 2025, there was upheaval with some cybersecurity leaders, stating that it was impossible or at the very least irresponsible. They lobbied Congress to repeal the requirements. Since the regulation took effect, no major issues have arisen from the 4-day requirement. The vast majority of US critical infrastructure is operated by private industry and concealing cybersecurity compromises only benefits the attackers. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is also looking to update rules specifically for US critical infrastructure, mandating a 72-hour notification, but the [final rule may not be published until mid-2026](https://www.dwt.com/blogs/privacy--security-law-blog/2025/09/cisa-delays-cyber-incident-reporting-rules-2026#:~:text=CIRCIA%20and%20the%20CISA%20rule,response%20to%20a%20ransomware%20attack.). China knows something and realizes the importance of early reporting. Even the most aggressive US reporting proposals falls far short of the 1-hour requirement in China. I hope my peers will remain calm, realize the necessity, and support early notification in the US. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from [Information Security Strategy](https://infosecstrategy.blogspot.com/) authored by [Matthew Rosenquist](https://securityboulevard.com/author/0/).

    "title": "Day after imposing tariff, Trump calls Indian economy 'dead'",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "**Washington:** US President [Donald Trump](https://www.siasat.com/tag/donald-trump/) once again mounted a sharp attack on India and Russia for their close ties and said that the two countries can take their “dead economies down together”. The US president’s fresh criticism of New Delhi and Moscow came hours after announcing 25 percent tariffs against India, plus a “penalty” for its trade with Russia. “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” he said. “We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World,” he added. The previous day, Trump announced the imposition of a 25 percent [tariff](https://www.siasat.com/tag/tarrif-hike/) on all goods coming from India starting August 1, plus an unspecified penalty for buying Russian crude oil and military equipment. The surprise announcement came a day after Indian officials said that a US trade team would visit from August 25 to negotiate a trade deal. The announcement is being seen as a pressure tactic to get New Delhi to agree to demands made by the US, which has, in recent days, got favourable trade deals with major partners like Japan, the UK and the European Union. Trump termed India’s trade policies as “most strenuous and obnoxious”. “All things not good! India will therefore be paying a tariff of 25 per cent, plus a penalty for the above, starting on August first,” Trump said in a social media post. The penalty was announced as India has made large purchases of oil and military equipment from Russia. India is the first country to face a penalty for Russian imports. India’s import of crude oil from Russia has risen from 0.2 percent of total purchases before the Russia-Ukraine war to 35-40 percent. New Delhi is the largest buyer of Russian oil after China. Trump said though India is America’s friend, “we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their (India) tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the world, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers of any country.” He said India has always purchased a significant amount of military equipment and energy products from Russia at a time when everyone wants Russia to stop the “killing” in Ukraine. ## Everybody knows Indian economy is dead: Rahul Gandhi Congress leader [Rahul Gandhi](https://www.siasat.com/tag/rahul-gandhi/) said everybody except Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman know that the Indian economy is “dead”, as he alleged that the BJP-led government has destroyed the country’s economic, defence and foreign policies. Speaking with reporters in the Parliament House complex, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha also claimed that a trade deal with the US will happen and Trump will define it, while Prime Minister Modi will do what the American President tells him to do. “He is right, everybody knows this except the prime minister and the finance minister. Everybody knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. I am glad that President Trump has stated a fact,” Gandhi said. > Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said everybody except Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman know that India is a “dead economy”, as he alleged that the BJP-led government has destroyed India's economic, defence and foreign policies.… [pic.twitter.com/qOliBtjLyn](https://t.co/qOliBtjLyn) > > — The Siasat Daily (@TheSiasatDaily) [July 31, 2025](https://twitter.com/TheSiasatDaily/status/1950848399101894788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ## Indian economy destroyed for Adani: Rahul Gandhi alleged that the BJP has destroyed the Indian economy in order to help billionaire Gautam Adani. “The External Affairs Minister gives a speech that we have a genius foreign policy. On one hand, the US is abusing you and on the other hand China is after, and thirdly when you send delegations across the globe then no country condemns Pakistan. How are they running the country? They don’t know how to run the country,” Gandhi said. Referring to Modi’s speech in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Gandhi said the PM neither took Trump’s name nor of China “He (Modi) did not say that no country condemned Pakistan. Trump is having lunch with Pakistan military chief who was behind the Pahalgam attack, and they are saying there has been a big success. What success is this? he said. “Trump has said 30 times that I got the ceasefire done (between India and Pakistan). Trump said five planes of India were downed, he is now saying I will put a 25 per cent tariff. Did you ask why Modi is not able to answer, what is the reason? Who has the control?” he said. Gandhi further said the main issue in front of India today is that the government has “destroyed” the country’s economic, defence and foreign policies. “They are running this country into the ground. The prime minister works only for one person – Adani. All small businesses have been wiped out,” he said. Referring to the India-US trade deal that is under negotiation, Gandhi said this deal will happen and Trump will define how this deal will happen. “Modi will do what Trump tells him to do,” the former Congress president said. Later, in a post on X, Gandhi said, “THE INDIAN ECONOMY IS DEAD. Modi killed it. 1.Adani-Modi partnership. 2. Demonetisation and a flawed GST 3. Failed ‘Assemble in India’ 4. MSMEs wiped out.5. Farmers crushed.” He alleged that Modi has destroyed the future of India’s youth because there are no jobs. > THE INDIAN ECONOMY IS DEAD. > > Modi killed it. > > 1\\. Adani-Modi partnership > > 2\\.

The United States’ power grid, once a marvel of 20th-century engineering, is now teetering on the edge of collapse. As demand surges from emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles, an aging infrastructure struggles to keep up. Recent blackouts, escalating costs, and regulatory bottlenecks are painting a picture of a system pushed to its limits. This article explores the crisis, what investors should watch for moving forward, and the ripple effects on everyday consumers, drawing on expert analysis and recent data. ### The Cracks in the Foundation: Why the Grid is Failing ### [Are you Paying High Taxes in New Jersey, New York, or California?](https://energynewsbeat.co/invest/) America’s electrical grid was largely built in the mid-20th century, with much of its transmission and distribution infrastructure now over 50 years old. According to recent reports, the grid faces unprecedented stress from a combination of factors. Electricity demand is skyrocketing: AI data centers alone consumed about 4.4% of U.S. electricity in 2023, a figure projected to triple by 2028. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts electricity sales to climb from 4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025, equivalent to adding the power needs of seven Seattle-sized cities in the next decade. Extreme weather exacerbates the vulnerabilities. Heatwaves in Texas and storms in California have triggered widespread blackouts, reminiscent of the 2003 Northeast blackout that left 50 million people in the dark. Cybersecurity threats and physical attacks on substations are on the rise, with the Department of Homeland Security emphasizing the grid’s critical status. Supply chain issues further compound the problem: lead times for large power transformers have stretched beyond 30 months by mid-2025, delaying essential upgrades. Regulatory hurdles add to the chaos. Transmission projects face five-to-seven-year delays due to permitting issues, jurisdictional disputes between utilities, states, and federal agencies, and policy gridlock. The CIRCUIT Act, introduced in February 2025 to boost domestic transformer production, remains stalled in Congress. Deloitte estimates that the U.S. power sector will require $1.4 trillion in new capital investments between 2025 and 2030 just to maintain reliability. ### Investment Opportunities: Where to Look as the Crisis Unfolds For investors, this gridlock isn’t just a headache—it’s a goldmine of opportunities. The push for modernization and reliability will favor certain sectors over others. Here’s what to watch: ### Behind-the-Meter Solutions and Companies As the centralized grid falters, decentralized “behind-the-meter” technologies—such as battery storage, microgrids, and rooftop solar—are gaining traction. These solutions allow businesses and households to generate and store power independently, reducing reliance on the main grid. Companies like Fluence Energy, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are poised for growth, with demand surging for their storage systems to handle peak loads from data centers and EVs. The Department of Energy (DOE) is allocating $32 million in 2025 for smart EV charging and distributed energy integration, signaling federal support. Investors should eye firms innovating in energy management software and modular storage, as these could see explosive adoption in high-demand regions like Northern Virginia, which handles 70% of global internet traffic. ### Natural Gas and Oil Companies Reliability is king in a strained grid, and fossil fuels still provide the backbone. With coal plants retiring (e.g., Utah’s 1,800 MW Intermountain Power Project), natural gas and oil are stepping in as “bridge” fuels. The DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants to avert shortages. Natural gas firms benefit from their flexibility and lower emissions profile compared to coal, while oil companies could see upticks in backup generation demand. Look for integrated energy giants with strong midstream assets, as they can capitalize on rising wholesale prices in deregulated markets like Texas and Arizona, where cooling demands are surging. Grid UtilitiesTraditional utilities are investing heavily to shore up the system. The DOE aims to boost long-distance transmission capacity by 16% by 2030 through 7,500 miles of new lines. Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion Energy, and Avangrid are leading the charge—Avangrid, for instance, plans $20 billion in investments across 23 states through 2030. These regulated utilities offer stable dividends and exposure to rate hikes as costs pass through to consumers. Independent power producers like NRG Energy are also attractive, profiting from elevated wholesale electricity prices amid supply constraints. In summary, a diversified approach makes sense: behind-the-meter for growth potential, natural gas/oil for reliability plays, and utilities for steady returns. However, risks like regulatory changes and supply chain disruptions loom large—focus on companies with strong balance sheets and innovation pipelines. ### How Consumers Will Feel the Pinch The grid’s woes will hit consumers hardest through higher bills and unreliable service. As utilities pass on upgrade costs, residential electricity prices are climbing nationwide—up about 6.5% from May 2024 to May 2025. Blackouts could become more frequent, disrupting daily life, work, and safety, especially in vulnerable areas prone to weather extremes. The impact varies by state, with some already facing exorbitant rates due to reliance on imported fuels, geography, or high demand. Below is a table of the top 10 most expensive states for residential electricity, based on EIA data for June 2025 (in cents per kWh). These states, often coastal or isolated, illustrate the uneven burden. Consumers in these states could see monthly bills exceed $200 for average usage, prompting shifts toward energy efficiency, solar adoption, or even relocation. Nationally, a Microsoft and Google-backed report warns of a shortage of 500,000 electricians in the next decade, further delaying home upgrades and EV installations. ### Looking Ahead: A Call for Action America’s grid crisis demands urgent investment and policy reform to avert catastrophe. While challenges mount, they also herald a transformation toward a smarter, more resilient energy system. Investors who position themselves wisely—balancing innovation with reliability—stand to benefit, but only if policymakers act swiftly. For consumers, the message is clear: prepare for higher costs and potential disruptions by exploring personal energy solutions today. ## [Avoid Paying Taxes in 2025](https://energynewsbeat.co/investinoil/) [Crude Oil, LNG, Jet Fuel price quote](http://energynewsbeat.co/tradingdesk/) [ENB Top News](http://energynewsbeat.co/top-news/)[ENB](http://energynewsbeat.co/) [Energy Dashboard](https://dashboard.energynewsbeat.com/?_gl=1*ij4iab*_ga*NTEyODgzNzk5LjE3MjM3Mzk2NjU.*_ga_JDVH4V200Q*MTcyNTU2OTQ3MC4xMzMxLjEuMTcyNTU2OTQ5Ny4zMy4wLjA.)

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

In October, the South China Morning Post reported that China had revived plans to build a 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) tunnel to divert water to Xinjiang province from the Yarlung Tsangpo River in southern Tibet and was testing the technique on a separate tunnel project. China denied that any such plans were underway. But when the Sang River then appeared muddier than normal in recent weeks and displayed elevated levels of iron, it struck a nerve in India. A local leader running for office in Arunachal Pradesh speculated that Chinese construction was responsible for the pollution, but he failed to provide evidence to back up his assertion and both Indian and Chinese leaders denied that China was responsible for the muddy waters.

    "full_text": "Economics \\| 4 min read \\| May 2025 # US: Forecasting the Tariff Impact on Inflation The cost pressure from tariffs is likely to push up the prices of both imported finished goods and domestically produced goods through the supply chain. We use an Input-Output table analysis to estimate the magnitude and composition of the cost-push shock. - Under our baseline scenario, we expect core personal consumptions expenditures (PCE) inflation to accelerate sharply to 3.6% y-o-y later this year. - The cost pressure from tariffs is likely to push up the prices of both imported finished goods and domestically produced goods through the supply chain. We use an Input-Output table analysis to estimate the magnitude and composition of the cost-push shock. - Beyond the impact on imported goods prices, we see risks of both positive and negative spillovers into domestic inflation dynamics. - Focusing on the future trajectory of major components of the price index will be crucial to gauging whether tariffs lead to a one-off inflation spike or more persistent price pressure. There are few historical precedents for the recent escalation in US trade restrictions. Beyond uncertainty over trade policy itself, the magnitude, breadth, and rapid implementation of tariffs all create uncertainty for the inflation outlook. In this note, we lay out a model for the inflation impact from tariffs. Both the magnitude of the inflation shock as well as the composition among components will be important for gauging the risks of more persistent price pressure. ## **The cost shock from tariffs** To translate higher import prices into domestic inflation, we create an Input-Output table price model, which enables us to analyze the impact of higher import prices on domestic inflation by considering the indirect impact through inter-industry transactions in addition to the direct impact through import prices of finished consumer goods. Core goods prices are more sensitive to changes in the tariff rate than service prices, but even among core goods prices, there is significant dispersion. For instance, new vehicle prices, one of the most trade-sensitive components, are affected due to higher prices of imported finished cars as well as imported parts through the supply chain. In contrast, some other goods are significantly less sensitive. For instance, we calculate the impact on new vehicle prices is eight times bigger than the impact on magazines and newspapers. Sensitivity of categories impacted by 20% non-energy tariffs on PCE prices for tariff-sensitive components Using the Input-Output table, we impose shocks of 10%, 20%, and 33% increases in import prices for non-energy goods and estimate the impact on PCE inflation, corresponding to our “aggressive,” “base case,” and “moderate scenarios.” Under the base case, our model suggests 20% tariffs push up the PCE price index by 1.4pp with about 40% of the price shocks stemming through higher production cost increases for domestic producers. By expenditure type, PCE core goods and non-core components (primarily food prices) are very sensitive to higher import prices, but core service prices are also likely to increase modestly due to higher input costs. Although the Input-Output table describes transactions between different sectors each year, we assume the price shocks caused by higher tariffs will largely materialize in Q2 and Q3 this year, considering the swift implementation of tariffs. The indirect impact of tariffs on domestically produced goods prices will likely be substantialTariffs will likely push up not only goods but also service prices We incorporate our estimated shocks derived from the Input-Output table into our inflation outlook with minor adjustments. As a result, under our base-case scenario, we assume core PCE inflation will rise to 3.6% y-o-y in December 2025, while under the aggressive and moderate tariff scenarios, core PCE inflation would be 4.5% and 3.1% y-o-y, respectively. We expect core PCE inflation to accelerate substantially this year; Core PCE inflation under three tariff scenarios ## **Interpreting inflation surprises** Beyond the value as a forecasting exercise, our framework also provides a benchmark for how to interpret inflation surprises in the months ahead. Beyond the magnitude of any inflation surprises, the composition of inflation will provide important clues as to whether tariffs are a one-off shock or a source of more persistent price pressure. On the one hand, there is uncertainty about the pass-through of tariffs to directly impacted prices. We assume exporting businesses abroad do not significantly adjust to offset tariffs, but there is a possibility that more aggressive trade restrictions lead to cost cuts. The degree of shock absorption by retailers is also uncertain. Retailers absorbed some cost increases resulting from higher Chinese tariffs during Trade War 1.0 in 2018-19. However, the degree of shock absorption by retailers might be limited, as the universal nature of reciprocal tariffs should constrain the capability of domestic distributors to circumvent tariffs by increasing imports from non-targeted countries. The more concerning risk, in our view, would be potential spillovers from tariffs into domestic goods and services. These types of surprises would have greater implications for the medium-term inflation outlook and Fed policy. For goods producers, universal tariffs create an incentive for domestic producers to raise prices for domestically produced goods beyond what is implied by tariff-induced cost increases. Used vehicle prices would be another instance of likely positive spillovers. These are not directly impacted by tariff costs, but would likely follow new vehicle prices higher. We have already seen some spillover effects on used vehicle prices _,_ as dealers are raising prices in anticipation of a demand shift from new vehicle markets due to tariffs. The table below shows the list of PCE price components in order of sensitivity to tariffs implied by the Input-Output table. The impact of 20% non-energy tariffs on PCE prices for tariff-sensitive components Beyond the aforementioned micro-level effects, tariffs also have the potential to affect inflation expectations. While the pandemic-induced inflationary pressures have not yet completely subsided, another inflation wave driven by tariffs could cause inflation expectations to become unanchored, making the inflationary shock more persistent. Other potentially severe supply chain disruptions pose additional upside risks, too, but are not incorporated into our model. Even if an imported component is typically a small share of a product’s cost, supply disruptions could lead to outsize inflation impacts – like when auto prices rose sharply due to a shortage of semiconductors in 2021-22. On the downside, macro headwinds could be caused by reduced aggregate demand in reaction to tariffs. This could make domestic retailers and wholesalers reluctant to pass on higher costs to their customers, but should also add disinflationary pressure to domestic goods and services. Sharp disinflation in less impacted goods and services could encourage the Fed to consider a return to pre-emptive rate cuts, since it would raise the risk that inflation may actually undershoot once the cost shock from tariffs has passed. ### Tags In - [Americas](https://www.nomuraconnects.com/tag/americas/) - [Economics](https://www.nomuraconnects.com/tag/economics/) - [Geopolitics](https://www.nomuraconnects.com/tag/geopolitics/) - [volatility](https://www.nomuraconnects.com/tag/volatility/) ### Contributors #### Aichi Amemiya Senior US Economist #### David Seif Chief Economist for Developed Markets #### Jeremy Schwartz Senior US Economist #### Ruchir Sharma US Economist ### Disclaimer This content has been prepared by Nomura solely for information purposes, and is not an offer to buy or sell or provide (as the case may be) or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell or enter into any agreement with respect to any security, product, service (including but not limited to investment advisory services) or investment.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "full_text": "Bangladesh will likely adopt a more assertive foreign policy, which will likely include strengthening ties with Pakistan while balancing its economic dependencies on India and maintaining cooperation on security and regional stability. On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

(YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images) In early fall, we examined the implications of increasing energy prices, including their potential to generate social unrest. Since then, many countries have witnessed more generalized inflation -- which is causing prices to rise for a variety of essentials, not just the energy that consumers pay to heat their homes, cook their food and drive their cars -- suggesting that unrest risks are expanding as more countries and more items are affected. As concerns grow that inflationary pressures will persist long into 2022 it is worth examining what countries may be most vulnerable to inflation-driven unrest and how it could play out. To do so, looking back at previous episodes of unrest linked to price rises can help evaluate what could happen in the coming year....

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

According to Human Rights in China (HRIC), a New York-based nongovernmental organization founded in 1989, the payload was launched on September 5, 2025, aboard a Ceres-1 (Yao-15) carrier rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The project was developed by the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and integrates a mix of artificial intelligence, anomaly detection, on-board inspection, autonomous decision-making, and even “intelligent deception” designed to mislead potential attackers. HRIC described the launch as a milestone in China’s vision of cyber-sovereignty, with far-reaching implications for both national security and global internet governance. “By embedding censorship, surveillance logic, and active defense techniques directly into space infrastructure, China is shaping the rules of the satellite internet race in ways that challenge open-network models such as Starlink,” the group said. In a detailed account, Beiyou News, the university’s news platform, reported that the firewall payload was one of three satellites launched on September 5. The “Satellite Internet Firewall” was independently developed by the National Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications at BUPT, under the leadership of Professors Zhao Yongli and Zhang Jie, and guided by Academician Guo Shize. Beiyou News said the project marked “a historic step forward” for China in satellite internet security, describing it as the world’s first multi-dimensional integrated security payload capable of protecting both the physical and network layers of satellite internet systems. The payload integrates several advanced technologies: - Multi-dimensional rule engine for filtering and detection. - AI-powered abnormal behavior sensing to detect suspicious activity. - Onboard inspections conducted in real time. - Large-scale autonomous decision-making models capable of running 14-billion-parameter optimization tasks. - Intelligent trapping mechanisms designed to lure and study attackers. This combination allows the satellite to detect and block cyberattacks in real time, safeguarding critical business and government communications. The system reportedly has the capacity to manage traffic at 10 Gbps concurrency, with more than 70,000 threat detection rules embedded. The firewall is designed to act as the first line of defense for satellite-to-ground and intersatellite communications. By providing onboard computing power and a real-time defense orchestration environment, the payload creates what Beiyou News called “an in-orbit firewall” that protects against high-volume and sudden traffic surges. The system also conducts automatic health checks of satellite ports and key services every minute, ensuring constant monitoring and protection. By linking network-layer threat detection with physical-layer monitoring, the firewall establishes a closed-loop defense mechanism. Beiyou News emphasized that the payload represented “a comprehensive improvement” of China’s satellite internet security capabilities, blending artificial intelligence and cybersecurity technologies into a lightweight but powerful defense system. HRIC warned that the satellite firewall extends the reach of China’s censorship and surveillance regime. Unlike traditional ground-based systems, which operate within national borders, the deployment of firewalls in orbit could impact global information flows, especially if China offers “secure” satellite internet to partner states under its Belt and Road Initiative or other strategic frameworks. “Who gets to decide what information flows freely in orbit?” HRIC asked in its analysis. The group argued that embedding such technology into the very infrastructure of space networks could consolidate Beijing’s control over not only its own population but also foreign users who depend on Chinese satellite services. The rights organization also highlighted the potential conflict between China’s satellite firewall and open-network systems like SpaceX’s Starlink, which are premised on unrestricted access to the internet. The deployment of censorship logic in orbit, HRIC said, could reshape competition in the satellite internet sector by making “secure but restricted” services an exportable model. For Beijing, the launch signals both a scientific breakthrough and a political statement. The successful development of the prototype firewall demonstrates China’s ability to integrate artificial intelligence into space-based cybersecurity systems despite limited onboard resources. It also reflects the government’s long-standing goal of fusing technological advancement with national security priorities. Beiyou News noted that the project was achieved after “repeated program demonstrations, technical breakthroughs, and payload optimization.” The team overcame challenges such as limited computing power in space and the need for real-time intelligent decision-making. The news outlet described the achievement as supporting China’s mission of “serving national needs, targeting international frontiers, focusing on scientific and technological innovation, and supporting major scientific and technological projects and national security needs.” HRIC underscored the symbolic dimension of the launch: the export of the “Great Firewall” from terrestrial networks to orbital systems. What began in the 1990s as a domestic mechanism for controlling access to foreign websites has now, with the September 5 launch, reached beyond Earth’s atmosphere. By moving censorship into orbit, China is positioning itself not just as a global power in space technology but as a rule-setter in the future governance of the satellite internet. As HRIC noted, “This is a milestone in China’s vision of extending cyber-sovereignty into orbit.” ##### [Ramananda Sengupta](https://stratnewsglobal.com/author/ramananda-sengupta/) [\\+ postsBio ⮌](https://stratnewsglobal.com/stratnewsglobal.com) In a career spanning three decades and counting, Ramananda (Ram to his friends) has been the foreign editor of The Telegraph, Outlook Magazine and the New Indian Express.

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

(Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Thus far, only sporadic violent plots and a few low-level attacks have targeted AI infrastructure like data centers. For the most part, pushback has taken the form of rhetoric and some nonviolent protests. The muted response reflects the fact that, for now, AI has yet to significantly demonstrate the type of grand promises or perils forecast by its dreamers or doomsdayers. This will not last. As AI ripples across societies and workplaces, upending daily life, labor markets and politics, the upheaval will inevitably spark backlash -- and at least some of the aggrieved will resort to violence.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "full_text": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India...",

(BIJU BORO/AFP/Getty Images) ## Highlights - _Despite the size and importance of the massive interconnected river system China and India share (along with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh), no integrated structure exists for its management, and the bilateral agreements that govern it are far from sufficient._ - _Political disputes, such as the 2017 standoff over the Doklam Plateau, could harm the waterways China and India share._ - _Unless the countries agree to institute a basinwide mechanism for water management, the river systems they both depend on will be at risk._ Nearly a year after their standoff on the Doklam Plateau began, India and China are trying to get their relationship back on track. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last month in Wuhan with just that goal in mind, and though their summit was more spectacle than substance, it was nonetheless a necessary step toward resolution. The informal meeting gave the two leaders a prime opportunity to lay aside, however briefly, their countries' long-standing differences and focus on topics of mutual concern, such as climate change, food security and natural disasters. Yet one related issue was missing from the agenda: water. If Beijing and New Delhi fail to address the matter, the repercussions for the region, its inhabitants and its environment will likely be devastating....

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up...",

    "full_text": "The new U.S. tariffs will particularly impact textile exports from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, exacerbating political and economic challenges and risking derailing their IMF programs. On April 2, the United States announced a new set of tariffs impacting many trading partners, including a 37% tariff on Bangladesh, 30% on Pakistan and 44% on Sri Lanka. While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances. This announcement came as all three countries are engaged in International Monetary Fund programs and face economic challenges, including high debt burdens and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. ...",

On May 26-27, Malaysia, as the 2025 ASEAN chair, hosted a series of summits that underscored ASEAN's broad dual-track initiatives to bolster intra-bloc trade and trade diversification. The 46th ASEAN Summit, convened on May 26, brought together leaders from the ten-member bloc and produced a new five-year strategic plan aimed at deepening economic integration among member states, with goals such as further harmonizing trade standards, enhancing financial integration and promoting sustainable economic practices. Leaders also committed to finalizing an upgraded ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement by October, which aims to further liberalize regional markets and boost intra-ASEAN trade beyond...",
