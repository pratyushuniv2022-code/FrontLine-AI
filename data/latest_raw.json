The slain Maoists were identified as Gautam Paswan, CPI-Maoist ‘Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee (BJSAC)’ member, who had a reward of INR 2.5 million on his head; Ajit Oraon _alias_ Charlis, BJSAC member, with an INR 2.5 million reward; Amar Ganjhu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; Ajay Yadav _alias_ Nandu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; and Sanjeet Bhuiyan, ‘sub-zonal commander’. During the search operation, the dead bodies of the five Maoists along with two AK-47 rifles, one INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, two other rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as items of daily use were recovered. On April 1, 2023, a CPI-Maoist cadre, Sameer Mohonda _alias_ Sadhu Linga (31), a member of the CPI-Maoist ‘Chatgaon Local Organizational Squad’, with a reward of INR 200,000 on his head, was killed in an encounter with C-60 Commandos in the Kiarkoti-Abujhmad Forest area of Bhamragarh _Taluka_ (revenue division) in the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra. Acting on intelligence inputs, the Commandos launched an operation and came under indiscriminate fire from a group of 60 to 70 Maoists hiding in the forest, who used Under Barrel Grenade Launchers (UBGLs) and other weapons. In the retaliatory fire, the C-60 Commandos killed one Maoist, while the others managed to flee into the dense forest. After the firing, which lasted for approximately an hour, the Security Forces (SFs) searched the area and recovered one .303 rifle, one gun, a country-made pistol, three magazines, 31 bullets, INR 38,000, medicines, Maoist literature and other materials. On March 28, 2023, a former deputy _Sarpanch_ (head of the _Panchayat_, village level local self-Government institution), Ramji Dodi, was abducted and killed by CPI-Maoist cadres in Zara village in the Narayanpur District of Chhattisgarh. Dodi was abducted, along with his two nephews, and taken to a forest where he was allegedly strangled to death by the Maoists. The nephews were released with Ramji’s body and a letter saying that he was killed because he was a ‘police informer’. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), there has been a total of 39 fatalities (20 civilians, nine SF personnel and 10 _Naxalites_, Left Wing Extremists) in Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-linked violence in the current year (data till April 9, 2023). During the corresponding period of 2022, the number of such fatalities was 49 (19 civilians, seven SF personnel and 23 _Naxalites_). Through 2022, there was a total of 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) in such violence. In the preceding year (2021), there was a total of 237 fatalities (58 civilians, 51 SF personnel, and 128 _Naxalites_). Overall fatalities were at 239 in 2020, 302 in 2019, 412 in 2018 and 335 in 2017. Overall fatalities have, thus, been on a decline since 2019. Moreover, the overall fatalities in 2022 were the lowest recorded in a single year since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE. Interestingly, the overall fatalities in 2021 were the pervious lowest recorded in a single year. A peak of 1,180 fatalities (630 civilians, 267 SF personnel, 265 _Naxalites_ and 18 unspecified) were recorded in 2010. As with overall fatalities, fatalities in 2022 in all three categories – civilian, SF and _Naxalite_ – were the lowest since 2000. A previous low of 58 in the civilian category was record in 2021. In the SF category, the previous low of 44 was recorded in 2020. A previous low of 87 in the _Naxalite_ category was recorded in 2004. Civilian and _Naxalite_ fatalities have also been on a continuous decline since 2019. SF fatalities have also declined through this period, barring 2021 (51 fatalities) when there was a spike compared to 2020 (44 fatalities). Other parameters of violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation relating to LWE activities across the country. The number of overall LWE-linked terrorist incidents fell from 676 in 2021 to 602 in 2022. In particular, incidents of killing came down from 124 in 2021 to 107 in 2022. Seven of the 107 overall incidents of killing were major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in 2022. In 2021, the number of major incidents was 15. Resultant fatalities from major incidents declined from 114 (seven civilians, 30 SF personnel, and 77 _Naxalites_) in 2021 to 22 (one civilian, three SF personnel, and 18 _Naxalites_) in 2022. In 2023, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents was 169, of which 32 were incidents of killing. Two major incidents have already been recorded in 2023. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2022, at 1:4.46, the best since 2000, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2021, the ratio was at 1:2.5. The ratio has remined in favour of the SFs since 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.61). In the current year, the kill ratio is in favour of the SFs at 1:1.11, so far (data till April 6, 2023). SFs arrested 395 _Naxalites_ in 2022, in addition to 409 in 2021, according to partial data compiled by SATP. In the current year, as on April 6, 2023, 122 arrests had been recorded. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, a total of 15,993 has been recorded. The mounting pressure on _Naxalites_ has yielded a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP, at least 2,855 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2022, in addition to 533 in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of surrenders was 97. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 16,581 LWEs have surrendered. Through 2022, SFs recovered arms from the Maoists in 190 incidents, in addition to 268 such incidents of recovery in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of such incidents are 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,694 incidents of arms recovery are documented. An analysis of over-ground and underground Maoist activities in the country’s LWE-affected areas also suggests a diminishing influence. According to SATP, in 2022, Maoist activities were reported from 10 States in comparison to 11 States in 2021. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 10 affected States have a total of 310 Districts, of which 58 recorded a Maoist presence. Of these 58, three districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 27 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 28 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2021, of 79 affected districts, one district fell in the ‘extremely-affected’ category, four in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 46 were ‘marginally affected’. Indeed, on March 28, 2023, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, in a written reply to a question in the _Lok Sabha_ (Lower House of the Indian Parliament), announced that the number of districts most affected by LWE had reduced from 35 in 2017 to 30 in April 2018, and then to 25 in July **[2021](https://pqals.nic.in/annex/1711/AU4464.pdf)**. Further, on March 28, 2023, the Government stated that the “geographical spread of violence has significantly reduced and only 176 Police Stations of 45 districts reported LWE violence in 2022, as compared to a high of 465 Police Stations of 96 districts in 2010”. Conspicuously, all major LWE-affected states across the country — **[Andhra Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-30)**, **[Bihar](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-31#assessment2)**, **[Chhattisgarh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-29#assessment2)**, **[Jharkhand](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-33#assessment2)**, **[Kerala](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-39#assessment2)**, **[Madhya Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-40#assessment2)**, **[Maharashtra](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-38#assessment2)**, **[Odisha](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-34#assessment2)**, and **[Telangana](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-37)** have witnessed an overall improvement in the security situation. Nevertheless, the Maoist challenge persists. OThe Perilous **[Bastar Division](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-22#assessment2)**, the safe haven of the residual Maoist problem not only in Chhattisgarh but across the entire LWE-affected region, comprising seven densely forested districts - Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur and Sukma - sprawling across 40,000 square kilometers, in the southernmost region of the state, is the location of the last Maoist bastions. On November 7, 2022, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar Range, Sundarraj P., asserting that the SFs were committed to wiping out the Maoist threat, nevertheless accepted, | | | --- | | In Bastar Range, though civilian killings have reduced to a great extent, from 279 in the year 2006, to 29 in 2022, it is still an area of major concern in left-wing extremist affected areas. | Indeed, on March 28, 2023, the Maoists abducted and killed two villagers, in Narayanpur and Sukma Districts, branding them as ‘Police informers’ (incidents mentioned above). Moreover, the early data for 2023 suggests that SF dominance on the ground, purely in terms of the kill ratio, has weakened during the first three months of 2023, as compared to the whole of 2022 and earlier. Not surprisingly, civilian insecurity has escalated. Disturbingly, more than a few deficits in the fighting forces remained noticeable in some of the worst Maoist-afflicted States, according to the _Bureau of Police Research & Development_ (BPR&D) data. BPR&D disclosed, as on January 1, 2021, that there were at least 28 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst affected State, that had no telephone. In Jharkhand, 47 had no vehicle, 211 had no telephone, and 31 had no wireless/mobile connectivity. In Andhra Pradesh, 65 Police Stations had no vehicle, and 34 had no wireless/mobile connectivity; and in Odisha, four had no vehicle, and three had no telephone. Moreover, large vacancies persist in the State Police Forces. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2021, against the sanctioned strength of 1,109,260 there were a total of 838,481 policemen in position in 10 LWE-affected States, leaving a vacancy of 270,779, i.e., 24.41 per cent. At the national level, deficits against sanctioned strength were 20.34 per cent, almost the same as the shortage in the Maoist affected States. The police-population ratio (policemen per hundred thousand population) of these 12 States had increased from an average of 138.63 in 2018 to 149.42 in 2019. Meanwhile, the all-India police-population ratio had increased from 150.80 in 2018 to 158.22 in 2019, significantly higher than the levels in the LWE affected States. Importantly, existing police-population ratios in these 12 states remained significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 183.97. At the national level, the existing levels were also significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 198.65 per 100,000. Moreover, the number of vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) of these 12 States was 595 (22.44 per cent), as against 948 (19.97 per cent) at the national level, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. These critical deficiencies in the enforcement apparatuses need urgent attention if the gains against the Maoists are to be consolidated further. The Maoists are down, but yet not out. The overall declining trend in Maoist violence and activity across the country needs to be contained with further security interventions with a sense of urgency, as the Maoists have shown incredible capacities for resurrection in the past, and retain substantial operational and overground capabilities in significant areas of their erstwhile regions of dominance. The SFs will have to overcome prevailing operational and capacity deficits, to prevent any rebel resurgence. | [Assessments Year

    "title": "Weaponizing Markets: India’s Naxalite Insurgency",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "“I have said in the past that left-wing extremism is the single biggest security challenge to the Indian state. It continues to be so.” – Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.[i] From Ideology To Warfare The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. Resurgence Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. A New Strategy “We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.” -Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. Overruns On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • Used improvised explosive devices. Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • Assassinated officials. In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • Destroyed police infrastructure. Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj Systems Disruption At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? The Deviant Economic Engine “The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.” -Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. The Revolutionary Tax In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. A Revolutionary Tax Economy To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • Mining. Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • Narcotics. India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • Informal tolls. Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. A Strategic Half-Life “It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they look to the Naxals for justice.” –Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future.

Again, few grid lines connected the Western and Northern regions; again, those interties loaded beyond usual service; again, the LDCs requested the Northern region shed load and the Western region reduce generation; again, the utilities' reaction was too small; and around 13:02 IST (07:32 UTC), again the Western and Northern regions separated, with power circling through the Eastern region grid. However, unlike the previous day, the [phase shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_shift) between the Northern and Western region grids extended into the Eastern region. Rather than separating from the overloaded Northern grid, the Eastern grid instead separated from the Western region, from which it had imported power.

It examined the causes of the blackout, and practicability of ensuring continued [rail services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport) during grid collapse, and issued its report on 16 August 2012. The committee found multiple systemic factors that predisposed the grid to collapse.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts#cite_note-InvestRpt-15) In general, utilities appeared to have invested little in blackout prevention, or done so _pro forma_. Power dispatch centers had insufficient monitoring tools to manage power flows, and used unreliable [cell phone services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_phone_service) to communicate with power plant control centers.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts#cite_note-InvestRpt-15): 35, 37–39, 46, 62 Any [islanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islanding) schemes appeared nonfunctional.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts#cite_note-InvestRpt-15): 36–37 Power stations appeared to have had adequate generation capacity to avoid the blackouts, but had (contrary to regulations) not implemented [droop speed control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_speed_control) on their [governors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(mechanics)), or set it aggressively enough.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts#cite_note-InvestRpt-15): 12, 27, 36–37 Many heavily loaded transmission lines appeared to have inadequate [parallel power storage facilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_power), such that an _underload_ at one end might appear as an overload at the other. Rather than installing power storage, many utilities had simply removed the transmission lines from service.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts#cite_note-InvestRpt-15): 28, 37 Local distribution networks also appeared overtaxed, forcing power flows onto the bulk power distribution system unnecessarily.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts#cite_note-InvestRpt-15): 38 The committee also suggested that [contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract) in the Indian [legal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_system) misrepresented the physics of the electrical grid. Utilities unexpectedly drawing power from their neighbors did not have to compensate those neighbors for the power. Consequently utilities only declared expected flows to avoid regulatory [fines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)). However, regulators incorrectly believed that they lacked legal authority to decrease the official capacity of [failed](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equipment_failure&action=edit&redlink=1) grid segments in [real time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_time).[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts#cite_note-InvestRpt-15): 33–35 The [proximate cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_cause) of the blackouts was the multiple existing outages (both scheduled and forced) that had limited inter-regional power transmission corridors on the days of the failures. These induced high loading on 400 kV Bina– [Gwalior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwalior)– [Agra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra) link, such that the grid could not [survive loss of that link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-1_criterion). The blackout then occurred when grid operators failed to reduce loading on the link and the link's protection system mistakenly removed it from service.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts#cite_note-InvestRpt-15) The committee also noticed that the grid appeared to have insufficient [black start](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_start) capability, requiring two separate rounds to bring all power plants on line. Conversely, power plant protection systems appeared insufficiently aggressive, as separation from the grid under high load had physically damaged the machinery in multiple [thermal power plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_power_plant). However, delays in restarting the grid appeared to arise from constraints other than physical, as [gas turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_turbine) power plants had also required an unduly long start-up time.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts#cite_note-InvestRpt-15): 48–49, 56 The investigation also refuted rumors that the grid had been brought down by a [cyberattack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack).[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts#cite_note-InvestRpt-15): 59, 61 ## See also\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2012_India_blackouts&action=edit&section=7)\\] - ![flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg/64px-Flag_of_India.svg.png)[India portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:India) - [![icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/59px-Crystal_energy.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Crystal_energy.svg)[Energy portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Energy) - [Electricity sector in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_India) - [Northeast blackout of 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003) - [Power outage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage) ## References\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2012_India_blackouts&action=edit&section=8)\\] 01. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts#cite_ref-BBCCut_1-0)**[\"Massive power cut hits India\"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1096957.stm). _BBC News_. 2 January 2001.

It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. Picture source: Depositphotos. _Prospects & Perspectives No. 28_ **The Shadow War: How the Pahalgam Terror Attack Redefined India-China-Pakistan Equation** By _Jagannath Panda_ The Pahalgam [terror attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl) of April 2025, executed by the Pakistan-backed group [The Resistance Front](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473) (TRF), was not merely another episode in the long-running saga of India-Pakistan hostility. It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. By and large, India’s reaction was strong, swift, and assertive beyond the border against the terrorist outfits harbored in Pakistan. The launch of [Operation Sindoor](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473), a precise military response targeting terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC), marked a defining evolution in India’s deterrence doctrine, pointing to a zero-tolerance strategy against terrorism. More than a tactical strike, it was a message — India will respond with resolve, not restraint, when its civilians are attacked. The operation drew clear parallels with the Balakot airstrikes of 2019, yet the context had shifted. The regional climate in 2025 is far more combustible, with trilateral tensions simmering in the Himalayas. The Pahalgam incident has exposed deep-seated fractures in the regional power matrix. China’s strategic posture in the aftermath — marked by conspicuous silence, selective language, and diplomatic hedging — underscores a growing contradiction between its self-styled image as a responsible global power and its operational behavior in South Asia. By refusing to acknowledge the terrorist dimension of such attacks or to pressure its close partner, Pakistan, Beijing reveals a troubling unwillingness to act as a genuine stabilizing force in the region. The contradictions in its stand are only growing and becoming more transparent to the world by the day. Is China truly committed to regional peace and stability, or is it bound by time-worn strategic alignments that prioritize geopolitical advantage over normative responsibility? Can a power that positions itself as an architect of global order afford to undermine its credibility by shielding a state associated with cross-border terrorism? What should be India’s strategic response to this shadow war? **Beijing’s Balancing Act: Neutrality or Strategic Collusion?** Following India’s retaliation, the world watched closely for diplomatic fallout. China’s response was a masterclass in studied ambiguity. Beijing termed India’s military action “ [regrettable](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202505/t20250507_11616523.html)” while conspicuously omitting any condemnation of the terror attack itself. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made [no mention](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/lxjzh/202505/t20250509_11618305.html) of the victims in Pahalgam, nor TRF’s Pakistani connections. Instead, Beijing’s focus remained firmly on urging “restraint” and “dialogue,” echoing a playbook that has often shielded Islamabad from international censure. This is not entirely a new behavior on the part of the Chinese leadership. Beijing has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the UN Security Council to [block designations of known terrorists](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slams-china-at-un-for-blocking-move-to-designate-2611-accused-sajid-mir-as-global-terrorist/article66993043.ece) based in Pakistan, including Sajid Mir, a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander involved in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008. This pattern of diplomatic protection underscores China’s strategic calculus: Pakistan is more than an ally — it is a linchpin in Beijing’s South Asia strategy and a buffer against Indian regional ascendency. What makes China’s stance especially problematic is its persistent refusal to differentiate between India’s counterterrorism actions and aggressive behavior. Chinese state media and official discourse frequently conflate Indian responses along the LoC with assertive conduct along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), crafting a narrative in which India is portrayed as a regional aggressor. This distortion allows Beijing to simultaneously align with Pakistan’s security outlook while maintaining a superficial neutrality. Moreover, China’s behavior mirrors its broader geopolitical approach: internal threats such as “Uyghur separatism” are met with uncompromising state violence, while external threats that affect neighbors like India are compartmentalized or ignored. The selective outrage is a window into Beijing’s dual standards on terrorism and state sovereignty. **Proxy Wars and Silent Partners: Redrawing the Diplomatic Map** Beyond the rhetoric, Beijing’s alignment with Pakistan is rooted in hard interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the crown jewel of Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This infrastructure project is not just about roads and pipelines — it’s about strategic depth. Any Indian challenge to the territorial status quo threatens both Pakistan’s and China’s investments, thereby sealing the logic of Beijing’s indirect complicity. This complicity extends into the diplomatic arena. In multilateral forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China has consistently [blocked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/human-rights-must-be-respected-india-after-skipping-xinjiang-vote/articleshow/94713915.cms) Indian attempts to highlight Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism. Instead, China promotes counterterrorism frameworks that align neatly with its own domestic narratives, especially those concerning Xinjiang, while conveniently avoiding issues that implicate Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues its [strategic silence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/22/asia/imran-khan-xinjiang-axios-intl-hnk) on China’s repression of Uyghur Muslims, despite its self-styled image as a champion of the Islamic world. This tacit exchange of blind spots — on terrorism and human rights — has become the bedrock of the Sino-Pakistani axis. And India, despite walking a tightrope on sensitive Chinese issues like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, has received no reciprocation in the form of diplomatic neutrality or support. The geopolitical geometry is clear: while India and Pakistan battle over borders and ideology, China plays the dual role of facilitator and firewall for Islamabad. Whether in backchannel diplomacy or in global institutions, China consistently acts to dilute pressure on Pakistan, reinforcing a strategic triangle that disadvantages New Delhi at every turn. Beijing’s deliberate omission of Pakistani provocations and cross-border violence in its Operation Sindoor response press briefings suggests a calculated strategic posture. This silence reflects China’s continued alignment with Pakistan, indicating that broader geopolitical considerations outweigh any immediate concerns about regional instability. By not publicly addressing Islamabad’s role, China signals its intent to preserve and prioritize its long-standing strategic partnership with Pakistan. **A Call for India’s Strategic Realignment** In this increasingly tangled web of interests, India must reassess its China doctrine. The idea of Beijing as a potential stabilizer in South Asia has little basis in reality. Instead, China has shown a consistent willingness to prioritize its strategic partnerships and investments over regional peace or normative alignment against terrorism. One avenue for India is to adopt a strategy of normative reciprocity. If China insists on referring to Jammu and Kashmir as a “disputed territory,” India could begin more openly addressing Chinese sensitive issues, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and potentially even Taiwan, revisiting its “One China” policy. Until now, India has largely upheld a principle of “mutual sensitivity” regarding core sovereignty concerns. While China has been increasingly assertive in internationalizing the Kashmir issue — whether through UN Security Council interventions, statements aligning with Pakistan, or selective cartographic provocations — India has avoided reciprocal commentary on China’s sensitive regions. This asymmetric restraint has allowed China to shape narratives unchallenged, while denying India the same deference on issues central to its national unity. Engaging Taiwan more openly — especially on trade, technology, and democratic solidarity — aligns India with other democracies like the U.S., Japan, and parts of Europe that have gradually normalized unofficial ties. Strengthening ties with Taiwan also offers India access to high-end manufacturing, especially in semiconductors, where Taiwan’s TSMC dominates global supply chains, critical for India’s tech and defense sectors. A closer India-Taiwan dynamic could be used as part of a broader Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance Chinese assertiveness in the region, especially when coupled with defense dialogues like the Quad. Explicit moves on Taiwan would likely provoke strong diplomatic and possibly economic retaliation from Beijing. This could take the form of border pressure along the LAC, trade restrictions, or cyber disruptions. Any move on Taiwan would have more impact if coordinated with partners like the U.S., Japan, or Australia. A unilateral shift may yield limited strategic gain while exposing India to disproportionate costs. It is therefore imperative that India must continue to invest more robustly in multilateral and minilateral coalitions that exclude or counterbalance China, such as the Quad, the India-Japan-Australia trilateral, and enhanced EU engagements. India’s aspiration to be recognized as a major international power, including in the “Global South,” depends not solely on its material capabilities but also on its normative influence, particularly in shaping global discourses on terrorism. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, New Delhi may need to recalibrate its approach by intensifying collaboration with global norm entrepreneurs, including middle powers across Europe and Asia, as well as transnational civil society and multilateral institutions. Moreover, India’s leadership roles in forums such as the G20 and BRICS present strategic platforms through which it can reframe regional security narratives and assert its vision for counterterrorism norms. Domestically, India must prepare for the long haul. The possibility of a coordinated two-front scenario — with Pakistan engaging in asymmetric warfare through proxy actors and irregular tactics and China providing strategic and diplomatic cover — is no longer hypothetical. Preparing for this evolving threat environment requires India to adopt a comprehensive and long-term security posture, encompassing military modernization, institutional resilience, and societal preparedness. Enhancing border infrastructure, upgrading intelligence and surveillance capabilities, and fortifying strategic deterrence must be non-negotiables in India’s defense roadmap. Sustaining a prolonged state of readiness requires a resilient defense-industrial base, robust supply chains, and financial planning. India must continue reforms to reduce dependence on foreign arms imports, incentivize indigenous R&D, and create strategic reserves for critical materials. Further, building robust logistical networks, especially in border states and high-altitude regions, will improve troop mobility and sustain long-term deployments. Civil-military synergy in infrastructure projects such as roads, airfields, and telecommunications along both western and eastern frontiers is essential. The shifting threat landscape demands that India move beyond reactive postures. Both Pakistan and China are adept at leveraging information warfare and disinformation to influence public opinion and sow discord. India must invest in counter-disinformation capacities, strategic communication, and public awareness campaigns to build regional and societal resilience against foreign psychological operations, where Taiwan could emerge as a stronger partner. New Delhi must significantly enhance its capabilities in narrative warfare — a strategic effort to shape perceptions, control the discourse, and influence international opinion. This involves not only countering adversarial narratives but also proactively framing its own story in a manner that resonates with global audiences. India’s case against Pakistan-based terrorism, as well as China’s tacit support through diplomatic silence or selective framing, must be articulated with clarity, credibility, and moral authority. To be effective, this narrative must be disseminated across multiple global platforms — from the United Nations and international media to think tanks, academic forums, and digital diplomacy channels — to expose the regional destabilizing roles of both Pakistan and China, and to align international sentiment with India’s security concerns and normative positions. The decision to send [delegations](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seven-all-party-delegations-to-take-indias-message-against-terrorism-to-key-partner-nations-government/article69586448.ece) to 32 nations is a strong first step. Publishing credible evidence, such as satellite imagery, financial trail disclosures, or intercepted communications, can further strengthen the factual basis of India’s narrative and pre-empt counterclaims. **Conclusion: Pahalgam as a Turning Point** The Pahalgam terrorist attack will be remembered not just for its human toll, but for what it revealed about the shifting tectonics of regional power complexities. It was a moment of clarity: India is not just facing a belligerent neighbor in Pakistan, but also contending with a cunning and double-standard power in China that is willing to obscure terrorism behind the veil of strategic self-interest. Increasingly, China’s actions — or calculated inactions — are rendering its strategic contradictions more visible to the international community, challenging the coherence of its South Asia policy and weakening its claim to impartiality in regional conflict resolution. The path ahead for India requires more than conventional military readiness; it calls for a fundamental reassessment of the strategic assumptions underpinning India's approach to China, particularly regarding Beijing’s role in shaping, enabling, or deferring regional crises. New Delhi’s challenge is two-fold. It must deter asymmetric threats from across the border, and it must decode and counteract the quieter, more insidious enablers of that threat. That means not just stronger borders, but sharper diplomacy. Not just better arms, but better arguments. Narrative warfare, if conducted strategically, allows India not just to defend its position but to shape the global agenda on terrorism and regional order, reinforcing its claim to normative leadership as a rising power. Pahalgam may have been a tragedy for India, but it is also an inflection point. A new foreign policy realism must follow. Because in this geopolitical theatre, the shadows are as dangerous as the swords.

    "title": "Dealing with violent civil protests in India",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

By emphasizing disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation, this year's theme calls for integrated approaches that not only protect public health but also ensure sustainable development. India's unique geography and climate make it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. With 27 out of 29 states and 7 union territories susceptible to natural hazards like floods, cyclones, droughts, and earthquakes, the country faces an uphill battle against the devastating impacts of climate change. As World Environmental Health Day 2024 approaches, it's crucial for India to take bold steps to enhance community resilience and protect its vulnerable populations. ### Geographical Factors Contributing to Disaster Risk India's geographical factors significantly contribute to its disaster risk profile, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The combination of its diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors creates a complex landscape of [vulnerabilities](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf): - [**Earthquakes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.7059oimyb6r3): Approximately 58.6% of India's landmass is susceptible to earthquakes, with the country situated in a seismically active zone due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. - [**Coastal Vulnerability**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.sipw79xc52s): India's coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, exposes it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. - [**Floods**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.af8gn4f1799i) and [**droughts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.xdkivgfc02df): about 40 million hectares (around 12% of the land) are prone to floods and river erosion, while 68% of cultivable land is vulnerable to droughts. - [**Landslides**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.kmor8crhvnf7) and avalanches: The hilly regions are also at risk from landslides and avalanches, further compounding the disaster risk faced by various communities across the nation. #### Seismic Activity India is situated at the convergence of several tectonic plates, making it prime for earthquakes. ~58% of the country’s landmass is classified as being at risk for earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity. This seismic vulnerability is particularly pronounced in regions such as the Himalayan belt, which experiences tremors due to ongoing tectonic activity. ##### The Gujarat (Bhuj) Earthquake (2001) For instance, the [2001 Bhuj earthquake](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bhuj-earthquake-of-2001), which registered a magnitude of 7.7, resulted in over 20,000 deaths and injured more than 150,000 others. The earthquake affected approximately 28 million people, destroyed more than 400,000 buildings, with the telecom building collapsing, Bhuj was isolated from the rest of the state; the most seriously affected was the Kandla port (the busiest port in India) which caters to handling crucial imports of petroleum products, crude oil and chemicals and export of agricultural commodities, with about five of the 10 jetties damaged. Over 10,000 small and medium industrial units had to stop production due to damage to plants, factories, and machinery. The Indian State Department [estimates](https://www.adrc.asia/publications/recovery_reports/Gujarat.pdf) that the earthquake affected, directly or indirectly, 15.9 million people out of 37.8 million. The government estimated the direct economic loss at $1.3 billion, while estimates indicate this could be as high as $5 billion. Following the earthquake, emergency relief operations were launched by both government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs): - [ActionAid India](https://www.actionaidindia.org/emergency/gujarat-earthquake-2001/) mobilized local community-based organizations to provide immediate assistance in the most affected areas, by establishing temporary shelters, distributed food and medical supplies, and set up psycho-social counseling services for survivors. - The government initiated a [comprehensive rehabilitation plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm) that included new building codesto ensure that the structures were designed to be earthquake-resistant; and infrastructure redevelopment of roads, schools, hospitals, and utilities was prioritized. - Emphasizing on community participation in planning and implementing disaster management strategies, village-level committees were formed to enhance local capacity for disaster response. - A [State Disaster Management Plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm#:~:text=Gujarat%20State%20Disaster%20Management%20Authority%20(GSDMA)%2C%20which%20would%20implement%20the%20reconstruction%20and%20rehabilitation%2C%20with%20support%20from%20various%20other%20agencies%20in%20the%20quake%2Dhit%20area.) was created that integrated lessons learned from the earthquake, and focused on risk assessment, early warning systems, and community-based disaster management practices aimed at reducing vulnerability to future seismic events. The resilience-building activities undertaken after the Gujarat earthquake reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate relief with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. These efforts underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in seismically active regions like India #### Coastal Vulnerability India's long coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, makes it highly vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis, [exposing](https://irade.org/Sustainable%20and%20Disaster%20Resilient%20Urban%20DevelopmentFinal%20.pdf) it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. This vulnerability is particularly pronounced in states like Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, which have borne the brunt of devastating cyclones in recent years. ###### Cyclone Fani (2019) Cyclone Fani, which made landfall in Odisha on May 3, 2019, serves as a prime example of the destruction that coastal areas face. The [extremely severe](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/cyclone-fani-damage-loss-and-needs-assessment) cyclonic storm caused extensive damage across 14 districts in Odisha, [affecting](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2019-000041-ind) at least 10 million people in the North-eastern Sates of India. Despite the early evacuation of a million people, the cyclone has severely affected the lives and livelihoods of more than 28 million people across 3 States in India. [Total damage](https://ncds.nic.in/sites/default/files/OEDS3NCDS.pdf) to existing stock of assets has been estimated at over $2.4 billion, whereas the economic losses flowing from the disaster are estimated at nearly ~$1.1 billion. In response to the devastation caused by Cyclone Fani, several resilience-building activities were implemented to enhance disaster preparedness and recovery efforts: - [The Government of Odisha](https://www.unicef.org/media/82111/file/India-Cyclone-Fani-SitRep-12-May-2019.pdf) coordinated one of the largest emergency preparedness exercises, mobilizing over 45,000 volunteers and 100,000 officials to ensure effective communication and evacuation protocols. This effort enabled the successful evacuation of approximately 1.47 million people from low-lying areas before the cyclone made landfall. - The state government constructed hundreds of cyclone shelters along the coast to provide safe refuge during storms, which were stocked with essentials like food and water. - Local stakeholders, NGOs, and civil society organizations collaborated with the government to conduct training programs on disaster preparedness including educating communities about evacuation routes and safety measures The resilience-building activities undertaken after Cyclone Fani reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate response efforts with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. The lessons learned from this cyclone underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in coastal regions like Odisha. #### Flood-Prone Areas Over 40 million hectares (about 12% of India’s land) is [prone to floods and river erosion](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf). The monsoon season often brings heavy rainfall leading to river overflow and flash floods, particularly in states like Assam and Bihar. ##### Assam Floods (2023) Assam, a state in northeastern India, is characterized by its fertile Brahmaputra Valley, which supports a rich agricultural sector. The state’s agriculture is primarily based on rice, tea, and jute, and it benefits from the regular monsoon rains that sustain its crops. The geographical features of Assam, including its river basins and low-lying areas, contribute significantly to its susceptibility to flooding. In 2023, Assam experienced devastating floods that [impacted](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/india-whats-really-behind-assams-worsening-floods) over 2.5 million people. In response to the challenges posed by flooding, particularly following the severe floods in 2023, several resilience-building activities have been undertaken in Assam: - The Assam government allocated Rs 1200 crs in 2023-24 for the [construction and maintenance](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=Infrastructure%20Development%3A%20The%20Assam%20government%20has%20allocated%20Rs%201%2C200%20crore%20for%20the%20construction%20and%20maintenance%20of%20flood%20control%20infrastructure%2C%20including%20embankments%20and%20flood%20barriers%2C%20for%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20period.) of flood control infrastructure, including embarkments and drainage systems and investment aimed to enhance the state's capacity to manage floodwaters effectively and reduce the risk of future inundations. - The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) invested ₹25 crores in developing advanced flood forecasting and early warning systems. These systems provide alerts up to three days in advance, allowing communities to prepare for impending floods and evacuate if necessary. - The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) [covers](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=The%20Pradhan%20Mantri%20Fasal%20Bima%20Yojana%20(PMFBY)%20covers%20around%2056%25%20of%20the%20farmers%20in%20Assam%20as%20of%202023.%20This%20scheme%20provides%20insurance%20coverage%20against%20crop%20losses%20due%20to%20natural%20calamities.) around 56% of farmers in Assam as of 2023, providing insurance against crop losses due to natural calamities. This scheme is crucial for protecting farmers' livelihoods and ensuring financial support during disasters. - A Community-Based Disaster Management project was launched in 2023, aimed at building local capacity for flood management in 100 selected gram panchayats focusing on on empowering communities with knowledge and resources to respond effectively to floods. In 2023, Assam introduced a ' [green budget](https://www.open-contracting.org/2023/09/28/improving-climate-resilience-in-flood-prone-assam-india/)' committing approximately $2 billion towards climate change action and disaster risk reduction, aiming to enhance long-term resilience against climate-related disasters through sustainable development practices. The resilience-building activities implemented in Assam following recent floods reflect a proactive approach to disaster risk reduction. By investing in infrastructure, enhancing early warning systems, promoting community engagement, and introducing innovative financial mechanisms like insurance schemes and green budgets, Assam is working towards building a more resilient agricultural sector capable of withstanding the impacts of flooding. #### Drought and Water Scarcity Drought and water scarcity are significant challenges in India, with [about](https://nidm.gov.in/pdf/trgReports/2021/July/Report_29July2021sk.pdf) 68% of the country's cultivable area vulnerable to these conditions. ##### Rajasthan Drought and Water Scarcity Rajasthan, the largest state in India, faces significant challenges related to water scarcity and drought leading to crop failures and economic distress among farmers. The state has [limited water resources](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/ar/261801490687132806/pdf/113703-WP-Water-Assessment-and-Potential-for-Private-Sector-Interventions-PUBLIC.pdf), with only 1.16% of India's total water supply, making it particularly susceptible to prolonged drought conditions. It's among the most [vulnerable to droughts](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/29/surajpura-rajasthan-india-drought-villagers-farmers-climate#:~:text=ajasthan%2C%20India%E2%80%99s%20largest%20state%2C%20is%20among%20the%20most%20vulnerable%20to%20droughts%2C%20with%2098%25%20of%20its%20250%20village%20blocks%20in%20sectors%20marked%20as%20%E2%80%9Cdark%20zones%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20areas%20with%20dangerously%20low%20groundwater%20levels%20%E2%80%93%20and%20almost%207%25%20of%20the%20land%20uncultivable), with 98% of its 250 village blocks in sectors marked as “dark zones” – areas with dangerously low groundwater levels – and almost 7% of the land uncultivable. In response to the recurring drought conditions, several resilience-building activities have been implemented in Rajasthan: - Rainwater harvesting and water conservation techniques were introduced to mitigate the effects of droughts and were prioritized via traditional techniques such as Anictus, Bairis, and tanks. In 2023, after an [unusually high rainfall](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/climate-opportunity-how-did-rajasthan-harvest-rainwater-after-the-early-monsoon-of-2023--94579) of 588.9 mm (nearly 2X the normal amount) villagers utilized these methods to direct the water into ponds and storage system, providing drinking water [for upto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwXQurAJLKs) 1.5 years in some villages. - The Rajasthan Water Sector Restructuring Project, costing a total of $495 million, of which $345 million is [financed](https://www.ndb.int/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rajasthan-Water-00012.pdf) by the New Development Bank, aimed to rehabilitate the Indira Gandhi Canal System, covering over 990 km of canal systems, reclamation of more than 33,000 km of waterlogged areas, and implementation of micro-irrigation techniques. Government schemes like the [Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana](https://pmksy.gov.in/) (PMKSY) were implemented to focus on enhancing irrigation facilities, along with the introduction of a crop insurance scheme to protect farmers from losses due to drought. Despite these resilience-building efforts, Rajasthan continues to face the challenges posed by recurring droughts. The state's vulnerability is exacerbated by its arid climate, limited water resources, and high dependence on agriculture. Sustained efforts and investments in water management, and agricultural practices are crucial for mitigating the impact of droughts and ensuring food security in the region. #### Topography and Landslides India's diverse topography includes mountainous regions that are particularly vulnerable to landslides and avalanches, especially during the monsoon season. The Himalayan region, along with the Western Ghats, experiences heavy rainfall that can destabilize slopes and trigger landslides. One of the most devastating recent events occurred in Wayanad, Kerala, where a series of landslides on July 30, 2024, resulted in significant loss of life and property. ##### The Wayanad Landslides (2024) On July 30, 2024, Wayanad district in Kerala was struck by catastrophic landslides that resulted from extreme rainfall. [The region](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece) received 572 mm of rainfall within 48 hours leading up to the disaster, causing hillsides to collapse in the villages of Mundakkai and Chooralmala. This resulted in over 336 fatalities, ~397 were injured, and at least 118 missing. The debris flow altered the course of the Iruvanjipuzha River, exacerbating flooding conditions in surrounding areas. The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) [reported](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/86000-sq-metres-of-land-slipped-away-debris-travelled-8-km-along-iruvanjippuzha-river-isro-satellite-images-reveal/articleshow/112231968.cms?from=mdr) that about 86,000 square meters of land had shifted due to the landslide. In response to the Wanayd landslides, several activities were initiated: - A [rescue operation](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece#:~:text=On%20August%201%2C%20Chief%20Minister%20Pinarayi%20Vijayan%20said%20over%209%2C300%20people%20were%20staying%20in%2091%20relief%20camps%20in%20Wayanad%20district.) was mobilized involving the Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and local authorities, over 9,300 people were accommodated in relief camps across the district. - [Experts](https://india.mongabay.com/2024/08/commentary-on-the-trail-of-the-wayanad-landslide/) have called for implementing site-specific land-use policies and improving drainage management to mitigate future risks. Additionally, establishing local landslide early warning systems (LEWS) has been recommended to enhance community preparedness. The Wayanad landslides highlight the urgent need for improved land management practices and disaster preparedness in vulnerable regions of India. By implementing effective resilience-building strategies, including community engagement and infrastructure improvements, it is possible to mitigate the impacts of future landslides and protect lives and livelihoods. India's unique geographical factors significantly contribute to its vulnerability to natural disasters. The country's diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors create a complex landscape of risks, including earthquakes, coastal vulnerability, floods, droughts, landslides, and avalanches. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events due to global warming. To address these challenges, India must adopt a comprehensive approach that integrates disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into its development plans. Building resilient communities requires a multi-faceted strategy that includes strengthening early warning systems, investing in resilient infrastructure, promoting community engagement, and adopting sustainable practices.

The measures aim to ‘maintain public safety and curb the spread of misinformation.’ In the past one week, violence in Manipur has taken a turn for the worse, with reports of ‘militants turning to newer technologies such as drones and rockets’ and adding a fresh layer of violence even as the use of rifles and grenade continued unabated. The context of this latest escalation is however the continued failure of the state and central governments, both ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to take any steps to arrest the violence and conflict. Internet services, including mobile data, lease lines, VSATs, broadband, and VPNs, have been halted in the valley districts of Imphal West, Imphal East, Thoubal, Bishnupur, and Kakching. Initially, the suspension was set for the entire state, but it was later amended to cover only these five districts. The Manipur Home Department cited concerns that social media could be used to spread inflammatory content, incite public unrest, and damage public and private property. The decision was made to counteract the activities of those spreading false rumours and hate speech. In addition to the internet suspension, indefinite curfews have been imposed starting at 11:00 am on September 11 in Imphal East and Imphal West, restricting movement except for essential services and the media. According to the orders by the Manipur government, the internet ban will continue till September 15. Notably, Thoubal district has also enacted a similar curfew. The opposition Congress has urged Union Home Minister Amit Shah to intervene, calling for decisive action by security forces to restore order. The state education department has ordered the closure of all schools and colleges on September 11 and 12. Exams scheduled by Manipur University have been postponed until further notice. Drastic measures have been employed by the government after last week, when violence erupted in Manipur’s Jiribam district, leading to the deaths of six people, not for the first time. When protestors took to street and clashes took place, prohibitory orders were issued. These incidents have taken place in the state despite an agreement between representatives of Meitei and Hmar communities to restore normalcy and prevent further arson during a meeting held on August 1 at a CRPF facility in Assam’s Cachar district. The meeting, moderated by Jiribam district administration, Assam Rifles, and CRPF personnel, included representatives from the Hmar, Meitei, Thadou, Paite, and Mizo communities of Jiribam. For the past 16 months, ethnic violence has ravaged Manipur, a state of around 2.85 million people. The conflict has claimed 235 lives, left thousands wounded, and displaced hundreds of thousands. What started as a clash between the majority Meitei community and the tribal Kuki groups has now deepened into bitter, seemingly irreparable divisions within Manipuri society. **What led to the eruption of violence?** On Saturday, August 31, large-scale protests erupted across Manipur’s Churachandpur and Kangpokpi districts as members of the Kuki-Zo community took to the streets demanding a separate administration. These rallies, which also spread to other regions, were organised in response to what the Kuki-Zo community described as “genocide and ethnic cleansing,” reinforcing their call for autonomy through a separate administration. The protests were particularly intense in areas like Leishang (Churachandpur), Keithelmanbi (Kangpokpi), and Moreh (Tengnoupal). In Churachandpur, the protest began at the Anglo-Kuki War Gate and proceeded to Peace Ground in Tuibong, covering about 6 km. The rally led to the closure of markets and schools, and government offices saw notably low attendance despite the state government’s appeal for institutions to remain open. In Kangpokpi district, hundreds of protesters marched from Keithelmanbi Military Colony to Thomas Ground at the district headquarters, covering approximately 8 km. The said protests had been sparked by viral audio clips, allegedly featuring Chief Minister N. Biren Singh making inflammatory comments related to the ongoing conflict in Manipur. The 48-minute recording, purportedly made during a meeting with Chief Minister Singh, allegedly reveals his “partisan complicity” in the ongoing violence. As per the report of _The Wire,_ the voice said to be of the chief minister can be heard making light of the crime against the two Kuki women, who had been paraded naked and had survived sexual violence, and berating Meitei civil society groups for not coming out and “ _asserting boldly, with pride_” that “ _it is we, the Meiteis who saved them from the mob”_. _“How badly we were shamed! We should have taken credit for saving them, clothing them and sending them home,_” the recording captured the speaker as saying. The Kuki-Zo organizations submitted several memoranda to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The memoranda submitted by the Kuki Students’ Organisation (KSO) in Kangpokpi demanded action against the chief minister, the strengthening of buffer zones with Assam Rifles, and an immediate political solution under Article 239A. A day after the protest, violence erupted across the region. SabrangIndia reached out to locals on the ground to understand the underlying causes of this September unrest. Speaking on condition of anonymity, several sources suggested that the recent surge in violence was a deliberate attempt to mask Chief Minister Biren’s failure to manage the deteriorating situation in the state. According to these sources, CM Biren has been seeking to shift the focus away from growing calls for his resignation by requesting control over the unified command of state security forces from the union government. They allege that Biren, fully aware that this request would likely be denied, is positioning himself to shift blame onto the central government for the ongoing chaos. Furthermore, the Kuki-Zo communities express deep concern that, if granted control over both state and central forces, CM Biren could use this power to further his agenda of eliminating the Kuki community from Assam. **Details of the violent episodes in the past week:** Since September 1, eleven people have been killed in various incidents across Manipur, prompting large-scale student protests in Thoubal and Imphal. Among those killed is a former serviceman. The killings span multiple regions across the state – five people died in Jiribam, which shares a border with Assam, and the former army man was killed in Sekmai, a town close to Imphal which is roughly 250 kilometres from Jiribam. The violence erupted on September 1, when bombs were thrown for the first time in the Koutuk Kadangband village. An alleged drone attack killed a woman and injured nine others, including an 11-year-old, igniting protests and further clashes, as people took to the streets. It is essential to highlight here that sources from the ground have alleged that the news of using drones and bombs is false, and that bullets were the cause of the death of the deceased woman. On September 2, a day after the drone attack, the CM’s convoy was stopped while he was on the way to Koutruk and Senjam Chirang in Imphal West to meet a victim who was injured in the incident. Union Home Minister Amit Shah advised him to turn back, citing the risk of further attacks due to his presence in the area Protesters, who had set up camp overnight in Imphal’s Khwairamband women’s market, issued a 24-hour ultimatum demanding the removal of central forces, the state Director General of Police (DGP), and the Security Advisor. They also called for Chief Minister N. Biren Singh to assume control of the unified command of state security forces and for the suspension of agreements with Kuki-Zo militant groups. Despite an imposed curfew, protesters moved towards high-security zones in Imphal, including the Raj Bhawan and the Chief Minister’s residence, leading to confrontations with police and security forces. The clashes, which involved the use of tear gas by security forces, resulted in over 60 protesters being injured and taken to RIMS Imphal West for treatment. On September 4, arson erupted in Jiribam district after suspected ‘tribal village volunteers’ set a house on fire early Wednesday morning. The three-room house at Jakuradhor in the district belonged to a retired police officer. Describing the incident, the police stated that armed men struck around 3.30 am, taking advantage of the darkness to burn down the house, located 28 km from Jiribam district headquarters, near Hmar-dominated Pherzawl district. The police had provided that the family had vacated the property following previous violence in the district. On September 6, a 78-year-old man was killed and six others sustained injuries as suspected militants, which news reports are suggesting to be from the Kuki community, targeted former Chief Minister Mairembam Koireng’s residence in Bishnupur district by lobbing a “powerful bomb”. According to police, the alleged bomb was lobbed from a long range fell on the compound of former Chief Minister Koireng’s residence, killing the elderly man on the spot. Koireng and his family members were not in the house during the alleged bomb attack. It is essential to note that in some media reports, the bomb attack has been described as a rocket attack. A report of the Hindustan Times provided that senior officers have described the alleged bomb/rocket fired to be at least four-feet long. “It seems the explosives were filled in a galvanised iron (GI) pipe. The GI pipes with explosives were then fitted in a country-made rocket launcher and fired simultaneously. For the projectile to travel a longer distance, the militants have to change the volume of the explosives. It seems they have been practising this during the months of lull,” the officer had provided. The deceased, identified as R.K. Rabei was preparing for some local religious ceremony when the bomb exploded. Six others, including a 13-year-old girl, suffered splinter injuries and were shifted to the hospital. The “powerful bomb”, which was detonated remotely, fell at a spot that is around a few km from the Indian National Army (INA) headquarters. On September 7, another wave of violence was reported from Serou, Moljol, Rashidpur and Nungchappi villages in Jiribam district, adjoining southern Assam. As per the details provided on social media, suspected militants, which reports suggest were from the Kuki community, had been attacking different areas of the Jiribam district throughout the week, during which an elderly Meitei resident was killed while the victim was sleeping. As per the state police, after the death of the elderly man, who was an ex-serviceman, the police in “retaliation” killed four alleged militants. However, there is no clarity from the police who conducted the “retaliatory attack”. However, Kuki tribal leaders have claimed that the slain cadres were not militants, and were only “Village Volunteers”. As per a report of Hindustan Times, an officer of a security force posted in Manipur had provided that “A gunfight started in the morning after militants entered a village and killed a man. The killing was part of the ethnic clashes. The gunfight is on. We have reports that the ones who died are from both Kuki and Meitei communities.” Subsequently, armed assailants engaged in a heavy exchange of fire in the Nunchapi area, leading to the deaths of three allegedly armed Kuki men and one allegedly armed Meitei man. Tension escalated also at Sugnu in Kakching district, from where gunfire and bombing were reported. On September 8, a former army jawan, belonging to Kuki community, was allegedly beaten to death at Sekmai, a Meitei-dominated area in conflict-hit Manipur’s Imphal West. Kuki organisations said the victim, Limlal Mate, was attacked after he reportedly drove his car into the area by mistake on Sunday night as per the Hindustan Times. The body of Mate, a resident of Sharon Veng in Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi district, was found in a pool of blood on Monday. Sources in a Kuki organisation said he was a former army person. Mate had lost his wife a few years ago and was living with his son, a source said. **Protests by Meitei groups urging to union government to take action:** Hundreds of Meitei students took to the streets on September 9 in Meitei-dominated Imphal Valley, protesting against the drone attacks and demanding a change in the leadership of the state’s unified command responsible for security. According to a police statement, protesters threw stones and plastic bottles near the main gate of the state governor’s residence. In response, police deployed tear gas and stun grenades to disperse the crowd, resulting in around 45 protesters sustaining minor injuries, a police officer reported as per Reuters. Around 6pm, 10 students accompanied by social activist Rohan Philem were allowed inside Raj Bhavan. Student leader Ch Victor Singh said that protesters gave Governor Lakshman Prasad Acharya 24 hours to respond to a list of demands, which includes the removal of the top police official in the state and the security adviser for their failure to control the violence, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. The Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), an umbrella organization of civil society groups, issued an ultimatum on Saturday, giving Central security forces a five-day deadline to “either take decisive action against Kuki militant groups or withdraw from the state.” In a statement, COCOMI expressed the growing distrust of the people of Manipur towards the central forces, particularly accusing the Assam Rifles of aiding Kuki extremists in their attacks on indigenous communities. COCOMI also announced that the “public emergency” declared on September 6 will remain in effect indefinitely. As part of this emergency, all public and private institutions, including markets, business establishments, and banks, are to remain closed. Roads will stay open only for emergency services, essential movements, and religious activities. Additionally, women’s groups and local clubs have been urged to prevent the movement of central armed forces in civilian areas and border zones if they fail to act against the alleged Kuki extremists. **Kuki-Zomi community protests against Assam Rifles withdrawal, demands union territory status** The Kuki Inpi Manipur, the apex body representing Kukis in the state, refuted claims made by the Manipur police on Tuesday regarding the use of drones to drop explosives. “Contrary to these allegations, the Kukis have never used drone bombs. It was, in fact, the Meiteis who first deployed drones in an attack on T Lailopjhai village on February 20, 2024,” the statement read. On September 9, thousands of Kuki-Zomi tribe members took to the streets of Kangpokpi District in protest against the proposed removal of Assam Rifles battalions. Organised by the Committee on Tribal Unity (CoTU), the rally underscored the community’s growing security concerns amidst recent violence. The protesters demanded political and territorial separation from the Meitei community, advocating for Union Territory status with its own legislature. The demonstrators in Kangpokpi District Headquarters opposed the withdrawal of the 9 and 22 Battalions of Assam Rifles stationed in Kangpokpi and Churachandpur, warning that their removal would further destabilize the region. After the rally, the protesters convened for a massive public meeting, where they mourned the deaths of four Kuki-Zomi people killed in Jiribam on September 7. The meeting culminated in a powerful five-point declaration, wherein the Kuki-Zomi community vowed to defend their ancestral lands with unwavering determination. They pledged to respond forcefully to any attacks on their villages or people, making clear that future aggressions would be met with equal retribution. The Kuki-Zomi community also voiced strong opposition to any policies implemented by the Manipur government, which they accused of marginalizing them politically, socially, and academically while favouring Meitei groups. They rejected the government’s eight-point demand, viewing it as a threat to their survival. Reaffirming their non-negotiable demand for political and geographical separation from the Meitei community, the Kuki-Zomi tribe called for Union Territory status, a demand they declared unyielding. **Manipur govt launches major combing operation amid escalating violence and drone attacks, security forces on high alert:** A major combing operation has been launched in Manipur, following fresh violence in Jiribam district on September 7. Briefing reporters, inspector general of police (Intelligence) K Kabib had provided that a robust anti-drone system had been deployed in the tense areas and police are in the process of buying additional weapons to counter the attacks on civilians. “The state force is closely monitoring the situation and senior officers have been deployed on the ground. Due to the recent drone attacks, an anti-drone system has been deployed and the state police are in the process of purchasing additional anti-drone guns, which will be deployed soon,” he said, as per Economic Times. The union has formed a committee of top officers from the police, army and paramilitary forces to examine the use of explosive-bearing drones. The committee is now preparing a report that it will submit by September 13. As per the media reports, the security agencies have recovered large caches of weapons in a significant arms haul in the state. The seized weapons include sniper rifles, pistols, guns, short- and long-range mortars, grenades, and long-range rocket bombs, among other ammunition, according to the India Today report. As per the report of Hindustan Times, a total of 92 checkpoints have been set up across various districts in Manipur, both in the hills and the valley. So far, the police have detained 129 individuals for violations in different districts of the state. Manipur Governor Lakshman Acharya’s office also issued a statement on September 10 expressing “deep concern.” A statement issued by the Raj Bhawan read, “The Governor has said that violence is not the solution to any problem. In his bid to solve the problem with the help of the public, the Hon’ble Governor is constantly speaking to public leaders, students and the people.” On September 11, IGP (Administration) K. Jayanta Singh described the situation as critically serious, stressing that security forces are needed to address attacks in fringe areas. Singh noted that the ongoing student protests have forced the deployment of additional resources to manage the agitators, detracting from efforts to protect vulnerable areas. “During such difficult times, when security forces are needed to commit to protecting lives and properties in fringe areas from attacks, miscreants and anti-socials are taking opportunities of such an agitation to target security forces,” Singh said. Congress MP from Inner Manipur A. Bimol Akoijam wrote to Union Home minister Amit Shah and called for a “thorough investigation into allegations of involvement by illegal immigrants, foreign elements, and the illicit drug mafia in the ongoing unrest.” **Manipur CM urges Union to “safeguard territorial integrity amid rising violence, rejects Kuki-Zo demands for separate administration”** On Sunday, September 8, Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh reportedly called on the central government to take firm steps to protect the state’s territorial integrity. He also urged the Centre to reject demands from Kuki-Zo groups for a separate administration. Following the latest bout of violence, security was heightened across Manipur. Officials described the situation as tense but under control. Chief Minister Singh met Governor Lakshman Prasad Acharya twice over the weekend, the second time on Sunday morning. During the meetings, Singh called for targeted operations by central security forces against militant camps in the hill regions. A source close to the matter told _The Hindu_ that Singh emphasized the need for a more “professional approach” to the crisis, which has been exacerbated by a drone attack in Imphal West on September 1. He also suggested that “subject experts” should be involved to address the situation more effectively. Following the clashes on September 7, Singh convened a meeting with ruling party legislators, which includes members of the BJP, Naga People’s Front, National People’s Party, and Janata Dal (United). According to a report in _The Indian Express_, the state government decided to press the Centre to take decisive action against insurgents. Singh, along with several Ministers and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) legislators, held a closed-door meeting with the Governor and submitted a memorandum, though its content has not been made public. Despite rumours, sources denied that Singh was considering resignation, stating that the meeting was intended to show unity and reassure the public that the government was working to manage the crisis. The escalation in violence, including a rocket attack, has intensified calls for stronger action. BJP MLA Rajkumar Imo Singh, son-in-law of Chief Minister Biren Singh, had earlier written to Home Minister Amit Shah, criticizing the central forces as “mute spectators” and questioning the effectiveness of their presence in restoring peace. Opposition leaders, such as Manipur Congress President Keisham Meghachandra Singh, have been vocal in their criticism of the Centre’s handling of the crisis. Meghachandra noted that the recent attacks have involved sophisticated weapons and bombings, and claimed that the state government’s powers have been effectively nullified, comparing the situation to an informal enforcement of Article 355.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote7) Close footnote The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote8)The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote9)Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote10)The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote11)The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. Close footnote ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote12)The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote13)By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote14)Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote15) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote16)Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote17)In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote18) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote19)In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote20)In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote21)Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. Close footnote Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows. [22](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote22)Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote23)Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote24) Close footnote A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote25)Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote26)A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote27)ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively. This is despite widespread condemnation from independent human rights bodies and refrains from the judiciary.[28](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote28)Following bulldozer action in the aftermath of the 2023 Nuh riots, the Punjab and Haryana High Court questioned whether the targeted demolitions of Muslim houses amounted to “an exercise of ethnic cleansing … by the State.”[29](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote29) Close footnote ## **Toward a Hindu** _**rashtra**_ **?** Religious polarization is likely to get worse in the run-up to the elections, with the BJP well-positioned to benefit electorally from the consolidation of a Hindu voting bloc.[30](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote30)At a campaign event during the ongoing elections, Modi himself stirred up communal tensions by referring to Muslims as “infiltrators” and raising alarms that the opposition planned to redistribute the country’s wealth to Muslims, a claim that was widely dismissed as misleading.[31](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote31)A recent report by the Washington, DC-based India Hate Lab found that hate speech, mainly directed against Muslims, peaked during campaigning for Indian state elections in 2023; the BJP won three of the five states that went to polls.[32](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote32)Anti-Muslim sentiment in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots, where Hindu mobs reportedly killed hundreds of Muslims, also helped Modi, then the chief minister of Gujarat, remain in power for over a decade before propelling his rise to the national level.[33](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote33)Besides the ‘Hindi heartland’ states of North and Central-West India, which have historically seen high levels of communal violence, religious polarization can also be expected to drive an increase in violence in states such as Kerala and West Bengal, as the BJP seeks to capitalize on Hindu pride to expand its political footprint.[34](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote34)The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote35)The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. Close footnote A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote36)Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote37)For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote38) Close footnote _**Visuals in this report were produced by Ana Marco.**_ ## Footnotes 01.

In April, a widespread [power outage in Spain](https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/blackout/28-april-2025-iberian-blackout/) showed how quickly a nation’s energy infrastructure can be stressed. If a similar outage were to occur in the UK and stretch beyond 24 hours, the effects would escalate from inconvenience to systemic risk for financial services: payment flows could seize up, trading could be disrupted, and millions could lose access to banking services. For a sector built on real-time settlement and continuous connectivity, this is a severe but plausible scenario that deserves active monitoring. These vulnerabilities are amplified by mounting pressures on the UK’s power system. Electricity demand is climbing, driven in part by the growth of data centres, the electrification of transport and heating. Much of the grid infrastructure is aging, with uneven investment in upgrades. Winter peaks are increasingly shaped by extreme weather, and longer spells of low wind or sun can tighten operating margins just as demand surges. Findings Against this backdrop, the Swift Centre Forecasters were asked: **_Will the UK experience an electricity blackout lasting over 24 hours before December 31st 2026 that severely disrupts financial services?_** ## **Findings** On average, the Swift Centre forecasters put the probability of the UK experiencing a blackout lasting more than 24 hours before the end of 2026 at 7.8%. This means roughly a one-in-twelve chance of a systemic disruption to the UK’s financial services within the next two years. And this figure only covers the most severe case – outages lasting more than 24 hours. Shorter blackouts, which can still disrupt payments and trading, are supposedly more plausible. Behind this headline number, views diverged. A group clustered at the higher end, around 17-18%, emphasising severe weather and infrastructure fragility. Others leaned much lower (0.5-5%), pointing to the historical rarity of such long outages and the grid’s proven resilience. The gap reflects different judgments about what could plausibly drive a multi-day blackout, as well as competing views on the UK’s ability to withstand shocks. Those on the lower end argued that blackouts lasting more than 24 hours are historically rare in the UK and that the grid has generally proven resilient. One noted: “ _We have events that can be considered ‘major’ UK blackouts… However, few if any lasted longer than 12 hours_.” Another gave a 2% estimate but said this would rise to 5-10% if shorter outages were considered. In their view, the most plausible drivers of a multi-day blackout would be supply shortages rather than extreme weather. While storms and floods regularly cause localised outages, these are usually resolved in under 24 hours. By contrast, past rolling blackouts were linked to fuel constraints, and the UK’s relatively small gas storage capacity still represents a vulnerability: > “ _We currently store 12 days’ worth of winter gas demand, compared with 89 days in Germany and 103 days in France._” Even so, they judged that interconnectors to Europe and imports from the U.S. and Middle East make outright shortages unlikely in the forecast period. Cyberattacks were also downplayed as a plausible trigger. The grid remains relatively isolated from the internet, and past incidents (such as the [2019 lightning strike](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d96100340f0b61743bd4cc3/20191003_E3C_Interim_Report_into_GB_Power_Disruption.pdf)) have been rapidly contained: > “A _long, nationwide blackout won’t occur, in spite of the Grid’s finer supply and response time margins._” Others in the low-probability camp nudged their estimates slightly higher (up to 5%), emphasising recent close calls and the challenges of managing a system with more variable renewables. One observed that “ _risk is higher than in the past with increased share of volatile renewables._” Another pointed to the [near-blackout in January 2025](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/09/britain-came-within-whisker-blackouts-national-grid/): “ _Such close calls do make one wonder if the system is sufficiently resilient. But at the same time, that the situation at worst would have resulted in planned blackouts of about three hours._” By contrast, those at the higher end placed more weight on weather and infrastructure fragility. One reasoned that “ _blackouts in the UK are not particularly frequent and almost all of them \\[…\\] are related to severe weather,_” and identified 3-6 instances in the past three decades where outages lasted over 24 hours, leading them to a double digit estimate. Another highlighted specific cases – the [2013 Christmas storms](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7c5576e5274a1b0042311a/DECC_-_Festive_disruption_review_-_Final__2_.pdf), [2015 floods](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-35020049), and storms [Arwen (2021)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/storm-arwen-electricity-distribution-disruption-review) and [Eunice (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Eunice#:~:text=The%20UK%20was%20particularly%20hard,km%2Fh)%20were%20recorded.) – and concluded that “ _large towns going out for more than 24 hours is quite common._” A third, giving a 17% probability, focused on infrastructure risk, pointing to [Heathrow’s 18-hour outage in 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-into-the-north-hyde-substation-outage-terms-of-reference) as a sign of weak redundancy: > “ _The recent shutdown of Heathrow due to a substation fire showed a weakness in ability to quickly shift to alternative sources._” They also added a small premium for cyberattacks, accounting for around 1.5% of their estimate. ## **If Winter Bites Harder** Forecasters were also asked to assess how their probabilities would change in the event of a severe winter in 2025 or 2026. In this scenario, severe winter was defined as record-low temperatures, low renewable generation, tight gas supplies, or extreme storms. Across the board, forecasters agreed that harsh winter conditions would make a long blackout more likely. Most described the effect as roughly doubling their baseline estimate, though the results varied widely depending on where they had started from. Justifications also differed: some emphasised the compounded stress on gas and renewables, others the physical damage caused by storms, and a few highlighted the risk of global energy supply constraints. For some, the increase was modest in absolute terms. One forecaster, for example, raised their probability from 2% to 4%, explaining: > “ _Even given a severe winter, I think the probability is very low as long as parts of the large town or region have power restored in under 24 hours, so I'm increasing my estimate by only two percentage points._” Another echoed this view, stressing that “ _Individual weather events like blizzards can cause blackouts without mounting to an extreme winter, so I go with a moderate increase._” Others arrived at higher final estimates. One calculated that roughly “ _47% of years with a major outage… would have resolved positively_” under the severe winter condition, leading them to double their baseline estimate to 40%. Another, who considered the combined risks of high winds, low temperature, major snow or ice storm, argued that resilience would be lower in such circumstances: > “ _Even the loss of a couple of power stations would be a major concern to the UK’s power grid._” They concluded that the probability would be about double their baseline, at 9.8%. Several forecasters pointed to infrastructure fragility and gas reliance as the key vulnerabilities exposed by severe winter conditions. One noted: > “ _The UK increasingly relies on natural gas and renewables. Given such reliance, a period of extreme cold along with low winds could \\[cause\\] selective power outages_.” Another cited National Energy System Operator projections showing “ _the strongest electricity operational margins for the UK grid since 2019,_” but still allowed for the possibility that an unusually cold winter could coincide with global demand pressures and LNG import shortages, settling on a 20% estimate. A final forecaster placed their probability at 25%, reasoning that while severe weather is rare in the UK, it can be very difficult to repair quickly when it does occur: > “ _Ice storms are very rare in the UK, but if they occur, can be devastating to power lines and time-consuming to repair. … I expect that loss of power to a medium-sized city for 24 hours is a relatively low bar and would be difficult to solve without repairs of numerous transmission lines._” ## **Knock-On Effects on Banking Services** Forecasters were also asked to estimate the likelihood that such a blackout would prevent at least 100,000 people in the UK from accessing their bank accounts before 2027. All forecasters judged this outcome to be plausible, with estimates ranging from 30% to 75% and averaging 58%. That implies better than even odds that a major blackout would leave more than 100,000 people unable to access their bank accounts. While confidence levels varied, the consensus was clear: a prolonged outage would almost certainly disrupt financial services on a large scale. At the top end, one forecaster assigned a 75% probability, arguing that the scale of disruption in a 24-hour+ blackout would inevitably capture this many people. Others supported this view with slightly lower estimates. One (62%) explained: > “ _If it lasts for more than 24 hours, it’s likely a nationwide blackout… This very likely means that more than 100,000 people would be unable to access their bank accounts or make payments for at least 12 hours._” Another (63%) stressed that “ _branches and ATMs would naturally be down… The last break point could be the one that matters the most, since an increasing number of people rely on the internet to bank._” Several other forecasters converging around the 50-60% range, emphasised that mundane banking services would fail under these conditions. One wrote: > “ _Should a blackout happen, just about everyone affected by a blackout will lose online access to bank accounts. The main banks may function OK for some time but \\[the\\] majority of the cashpoints will be down. And of course 99% of stores of all kinds will not be able to receive card payments._” Another added that “ _even for those with access to banking by phone app and laptop, cell tower operation, internet service, and the ability to recharge devices are likely to put the number over 100,000._” The only forecaster at the lower end (30%) argued that the internet is not always disabled during power outages, and that people might continue using phones and other battery-operated devices, limiting the number directly affected. Despite these differences, the consensus was clear: once a 24-hours blackout occurs, cascading failures across ATMs, payment systems, telecommunications, and local infrastructure make it highly likely that at least 100,000 people will lose access to their bank accounts. ## **Conclusion** Forecasters judged a multi-day UK blackout to be relatively unlikely – in the single digits under normal conditions – yet the aggregated estimate of 7.8% (with highs of 18%) is still concerning. For a risk that could paralyse payments, trading, and customer access to banking services, even single-digit probabilities amount to a material threat. The risk also rises further under severe winter conditions, with several forecasters effectively doubling their baseline estimates in that scenario. And the consensus was clear: if such a blackout were to occur, the impact on the financial system would be severe.

    "full_text": "**Executive Summary** Over the past year, the energy sector—particularly electricity grids and nuclear facilities—has experienced a marked uptick in cyber threats from ransomware groups, ideologically driven hacktivists, and state-backed espionage actors. Ransomware operators such as RansomHub and DragonForce have inflicted multimillion-dollar losses on major oil and gas service firms, while hacktivist collectives like Z-Pentest and Noname057(16) have claimed disruptive actions against operational technology (OT) components at critical installations. Simultaneously, advanced persistent threat (APT) groups—including North Korea’s Lazarus Group—have launched covert campaigns to harvest credentials and sensitive project data from nuclear personnel, as documented by Kaspersky’s “Operation DreamJob”. Converging this risk landscape are two accelerating trends: the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into energy operations, which broadens attack surfaces, and the increasing number of vulnerable points on North American power grids, rising by roughly 60 per day according to NERC. To bolster resilience, industry stakeholders must adopt rigorous network segmentation, continuous dark-web monitoring, and proactive vendor risk assessments, supplemented by the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2024 cybersecurity guidelines for distributed energy resources. **Background: A Shifting Threat Landscape** **IT-OT Convergence and AI Adoption** The blurring boundary between enterprise IT and OT environments has exponentially increased the attack surface for energy providers. Historically isolated control networks are now linked to corporate systems for analytics and remote management, creating new lateral-movement pathways for adversaries. Meanwhile, the rapid incorporation of AI tools—from predictive maintenance to grid-load forecasting—has introduced novel vulnerabilities, as threat actors leverage AI-generated phishing campaigns and automated vulnerability scanning to expedite intrusions. **Expanding Grid Vulnerabilities** In early 2024, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) reported that potential cyber vulnerabilities in U.S. and Canadian electrical networks were increasing at a rate of approximately 60 new points per day—rising from roughly 21,000 to 24,000 weak or outdated endpoints year-over-year. A Reuters analysis linked this trend to global geopolitical tensions—most notably Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Gaza conflict—compounding traditional criminal and insider threats. **Ransomware and Extremist-Driven Attacks** **High-Profile Ransomware Incidents** The energy sector has seen record ransomware payouts and operational disruptions. In August 2024, the RansomHub gang struck Halliburton, one of the world’s largest oilfield services companies, extracting an estimated $35 million in financial impact after forcing system shutdowns and customer disconnects. Subsequent intelligence revealed RansomHub’s migration to the DrangForce RaaS platform, signaling a consolidation of high-capacity affiliates capable of targeting industrial enterprises. **Ideological Extremism and Hacktivism** Beyond purely financial extortion, hacktivists have mounted operations under ideological banners. Pro-Russia groups such as Z-Pentest and “Sector 16” (S16) have claimed breaches at oil-well control systems—publishing screen captures of SCADA dashboards allegedly manipulated mid-flow. In March 2025, S16’s affiliate Noname057(16) announced DDoS assaults on Framatome in France and on Doel and Tihange reactors in Belgium—facilities that collectively constitute half of Belgium’s four nuclear reactors. While these distributed-denial-of-service attacks posed no immediate safety risk to OT systems—owing to mandatory air-gapped architectures—the public claims illustrate growing audacity among hacktivist networks. **Nation-State Espionage Targeting Nuclear Assets** Advanced persistent threat groups have long eyed nuclear installations for espionage and strategic gain: - **Lazarus Group (North Korea):** In late 2024, Kaspersky researchers identified “Operation DreamJob,” a spear-phishing campaign that distributed malicious archive files masquerading as IT assessment tests to nuclear professionals, deploying a modular backdoor dubbed CookiePlus to exfiltrate sensitive project data. - **Cyb3rAv3ngers (Iran):** Separate reporting indicates covert credential harvesting efforts targeting nuclear research academies and procurement networks, aimed at advancing uranium enrichment programs. - **Chinese and Russian Intelligence:** Shadow campaigns have been detected probing utility control network supply chains, leveraging third-party software vulnerabilities as entry points into restricted OT segments. **Mitigation and Strategic Recommendations** As the energy sector confronts increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, Argen Energy offers a comprehensive suite of solutions designed to enhance resilience and ensure operational continuity.

Due to its geographical location, seismic risk zone and intertropical convergence point, the Indian subcontinent also faces recurring atmospheric phenomena: heavy monsoon rains, floods, episodes of high heat, drought, etc. In addition, the high population density in risk areas further aggravates the situation. The number of human casualties continues to rise, from 1 674 deaths in 2015 to 2 045 in 2019. According to the report of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the total number of people who died between 2 000 and 2 019 is 79 732. During the same period, India had reported 321 catastrophic events. It is the third country in the world in terms of the number of [natural disasters](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/natural-disasters-in-2021), behind China and the United States. According to the same report, India has suffered nearly 80 billion USD in economic losses in 20 years. ## Breakdown of natural disasters in India per type of event and nature of losses | Natural disasters | Material loss | Human loss | | --- | --- | --- | | **Floods** | 52% | 63% | 32% | | **Hurricanes** | 30% | 19% | 32% | | **Landslides** | 10% | - | 2% | | **Earthquakes** | 5% | 10% | 33% | | **Droughts** | 3% | 5% | 1% | | Total | 100% | 100% | 100% | **Source :** World Bank Some of the most frequent disasters include : **Floods** After China, India is the second country hardest hit by floods with no less than 17 of such events annually, affecting 345 million Indians. This scourge has caused a significant number of casualties and major economic damage to infrastructure, property, livelihoods and crops. Heavy monsoon rains in the eastern part of the country often cause the Brahmaputra River to overflow, with disastrous consequences. According to the 2019 Global Climate Risk Index report, floods account for 52% of the total calamities affecting India, claiming 63% of the material damage and 32% of the human losses reported as natural disasters. On an annual average, 7.500.000 hectares are flooded, and 1.600 lives are lost. **Earthquakes** The probability of an earthquake is high in India, with nearly 60% of the territory being classified as a moderate to severe seismic risk zone. According to seismologists, the Himalayas, one of the regions most exposed to earthquakes, should one day suffer a mega-shock caused by the pressure accumulated in the subsoil of the Himalayan arc. The last earthquake to date occurred in 2015. With a magnitude of 7.8, the earthquake killed 9 000 people and injured more than 20 000 others. More than 600 000 homes were also destroyed by the tremor. **Cyclones** Located in the intertropical convergence zone, the Indian subcontinent is one of the regions most affected by cyclones. Its coastline stretching over more than 8 000 kilometers accounts for nearly 10% of the world's tropical cyclones, the majority of which emerge over the Bay of Bengal and strike the east coast of India. On average, six to eight depressions form each year, two or three of which turn into tropical cyclones. A major cyclone (category 3 or more) develops every two years. In May 2020, [Cyclone Amphan](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/cyclone-amphan-15-billion-usd-of-economic-losses-in-south-asia), devastated India and Bangladesh, killing 84 people and devastating the coastal areas of both countries. It was the most powerful cyclone to hit the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 cyclone that killed 10 000 people in Odisha State (northeast India). **Heat waves and droughts** Extreme temperatures and resulting weather conditions significantly affect the health of residents and the agricultural sector. With global warming, these episodes of intense heat, more than 50 degrees, are becoming increasingly frequent. According to Indian authorities, in the last four years the country has reported no less than 4 620 deaths caused by heat waves which generally occur between March and June. The last event of this kind occurred in June 2019, claiming the lives of 50 people in 24 hours. Over the past 20 years, India has also sustained the two most severe droughts in the world. They took place in 2002 and 2015 and affected 300 and 330 million Indians, respectively. Despite the affordability of coverage and the intensity and frequency of natural events, the penetration rate of natural catastrophe insurance in India is almost nil, with less than 1% of the population contracting an insurance policy for this type of risk. For several years, the authorities have been planning to set up a national pool dedicated to natural disasters, a structure struggling to see the light of day. ## List of major natural disasters that have occurred over the last 20 years in India | Date | Place | Nature of the event | Economic losses | Insured losses | Number of fatalities | Number of affected persons | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | (in billion USD) | | **May 2020** | West Bengal | Hurricane Amphan | 13.5 | ND | 103 | 500 000 homeless | | **August 2018** | Kerala | Floods | 3.52 | 0.37 | 504 | 223 139 homeless | | **November 2015** | Chennai (Tamil Nadu) | Floods | 2.37 | 0.98 | 289 | -

The recent floods across parts of India are the consequence of a wide range of factors, including excessive untimely and prolonged rainfall that occurred, coastal storm surge, water main breaks, dam failures, and more. Flooding results in instant devastation. Floods have the potential to cause significant business disruptions, food shortages, and product shortages. Companies in India have begun acknowledging such natural catastrophic risks to their business; however, concrete efforts are still nascent. Initiatives tend to focus on driving stewardship rather than addressing material risks to operations and value chains. Moreover, very few companies are quantifying their current and future climate risks in financial terms. Floods have caused the most devastation of any of these disasters, notably hitting the states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. According to reports, the floods have significantly damaged the area and resulted in an estimated economic loss of between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 crore. The severe damage caused by these floods and previous incidents like the 'Biparjoy' cyclone has raised serious concerns. It emphasises how India is vulnerable to several natural hazards due to its geographic and geographic location. These figures highlight how important catastrophe preparedness is for companies doing business in India. As the country experiences a high frequency of natural disasters, it becomes crucial for businesses to proactively address potential risks and adopt resilient strategies to protect their operations and assets. The effects of natural catastrophes on business operations can be reduced by putting into place comprehensive disaster management plans that include risk assessments, emergency response procedures, and continuity measures. Companies should consider conducting comprehensive risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities and develop contingency plans specific to their locations and industry sectors. This will enable them to better understand the potential risks they face and formulate tailored strategies for disaster preparedness and response. With the increasing frequency and severity of floods in our region, it is essential to prioritise disaster recovery planning to protect the business establishment. Floods can have a devastating impact on businesses, causing damage to infrastructure, disrupting operations, and leading to financial losses. By taking proactive measures, we can mitigate risks and enhance resilience. Here is a checklist that outlines some key considerations for businesses: 01. **Risk assessment**: Determines the frequency and severity of natural, man-made and political perils that can affect the organisation and its facilities. By identifying and quantifying these exposures, controls can be implemented to mitigate them as well as provide a cost/ benefit analysis to justify investment in these controls. 02. **Insurance coverage**: Review your insurance policies, particularly your property and business interruption coverage, to ensure they include adequate protection against flood-related damages. Engage with your insurance provider to understand the extent of coverage and any additional options available for flood insurance. 03. **Emergency response plan**: Develop a comprehensive emergency response plan specific to flooding scenarios. Clearly outline roles and responsibilities for your staff during a flood event, establish evacuation procedures, and designate assembly points or safe areas. Regularly review and update this plan as necessary. 04. **Data backup and recovery**: Implement a robust data backup and recovery system to protect your business's critical information. Store backups offsite or in the cloud to ensure accessibility even if your primary systems are compromised during a flood. Test the restoration process periodically to verify its effectiveness. 05. **Physical protection measures**: Take physical measures to safeguard your establishment from flood damage. This may include installing flood barriers or shields, sealing openings vulnerable to water ingress, elevating electrical systems and valuable equipment, and relocating critical utilities to higher levels. 06. **Communication and notification**: Establish reliable communication channels to quickly disseminate information to employees, customers, and suppliers during a flood event. Develop a communication plan that includes alternative means of contact if traditional channels are disrupted. Keep stakeholders informed about any changes in operations or disruptions to services. 07. **Inventory and asset protection**: Regularly maintain an updated inventory of your business assets, including equipment, stock, and supplies. Implement measures to protect inventory from flood damage, such as elevating storage or using waterproof containers. Develop a plan for relocating inventory in case of an impending flood. 08. **Business continuity plan**: Create a business continuity plan that outlines steps to resume operations after a flood. This includes identifying alternative locations or temporary workspaces, establishing communication channels with key stakeholders, and prioritising critical activities to minimise downtime. 09. **Employee safety and support**: Prioritise the safety and wellbeing of employees. Educate them about flood risks and safety protocols, provide training on evacuation procedures, and ensure access to necessary resources, such as emergency supplies and medical assistance. Offer support and resources for employees affected by floods, demonstrating your commitment to their welfare. 10. **Coordination with external agencies**: Coordinate response, continuity and restoration activities with local, regional and national authorities, and with compliance to statutes and regulations. Share best practices, and collectively address challenges. By implementing measures from the checklist, businesses can significantly reduce the impact of natural catastrophic (NatCat) perils and expedite the recovery process. Adaptation and preparedness are key to maintaining continuity, safeguarding assets, and protecting your employees and customers. ### We can help WTW’s Strategic Risk Consulting experts can help mitigate clients total cost of risk (TCOR).

The most notorious civil struggle has been the conflict with Kashmir insurgents, a border conflict between India and Pakistan that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The group was inspired by the agrarian revolution ideology as a means to achieve equality. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. The Naxalites are considered far-left radical communists and are declared a terrorist group under Indian law. In this report we will look into the Maoist movement in India, starting with its history. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group’s success and the global geopolitical consequences. **[View the full report](https://www.confluenceinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/weekly_geopolitical_report_10_28_2013.pdf)** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors.

    "full_text": "by [Gyana Swain](https://www.csoonline.com/profile/gyana-swain-2/) # Chinese hackers breached critical infrastructure globally using enterprise network gear News Sep 29, 20255 mins Cyberattacks[Security](https://www.csoonline.com/security/) ## RedNovember group exploited VPN appliances and firewalls to hit defense contractors, government agencies, and manufacturers in a year-long espionage campaign. Credit: FOTOGRIN - shutterstock.com A Chinese state-sponsored hacker group called RedNovember has conducted a global espionage campaign targeting critical infrastructure between June 2024 and July 2025, compromising defense contractors, government agencies, and major corporations while exploiting vulnerabilities faster than organizations could deploy security patches. The attacks included breaches of at least two US defense contractors and more than 30 Panamanian government agencies as part of a systematic targeting across the US, Europe, Asia, and South America, according to cybersecurity firm [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/rednovember-targets-government-defense-and-technology-organizations). The threat group deployed the Go-based Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike, and SparkRAT to maintain persistent network access after exploiting flaws in enterprise appliances, researchers said in the report. “The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms,” the report added. Recorded Future’s Insikt Group had previously tracked the activity under the designation TAG-100 before attributing it to Chinese state-sponsored operations. Microsoft also tracks overlapping activity from this group as Storm-2077. ## Systematic exploitation of enterprise network devices RedNovember systematically targeted internet-facing appliances that form the backbone of enterprise network security, successfully compromising SonicWall VPN devices, Ivanti Connect Secure appliances, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, F5 BIG-IP systems, Sophos SSL VPN products, and Fortinet FortiGate firewalls, researchers found. The hackers exploited both recently disclosed vulnerabilities and older flaws that organizations had failed to patch. RedNovember compromised two US defense contractors in April 2025 using CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti appliances – flaws for which patches had been available since January 2024, the report said. A European engine manufacturer that produces aerospace components was breached through its SonicWall VPN device, while multiple law firms fell victim through compromised network appliances, researchers documented. ## 72-hour vulnerability exploitation window RedNovember demonstrated the ability to weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities faster than most organizations could deploy patches, researchers found. When researchers published proof-of-concept code for Check Point VPN vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 on [May 30, 2024](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/), RedNovember was attacking vulnerable systems by June 3. That campaign hit at least 60 organizations across Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the United States within four days, according to the report. Similar patterns emerged with Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, with RedNovember consistently exploiting disclosed vulnerabilities within 72 hours of public exploit code availability, the research showed. ## Open-source tools masked attribution Rather than developing custom malware, RedNovember relied heavily on publicly available tools, including the Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework, and SparkRAT remote access tool, all written in the Go programming language, researchers found. The hackers used variants of the LESLIELOADER tool to deploy SparkRAT on compromised systems, with samples first detected in March 2024, according to the analysis. RedNovember also leveraged legitimate services, including vulnerability scanning tools like PortSwigger’s Burp Suite and VPN services, including ExpressVPN and Cloudflare’s Warp, to manage their infrastructure. “RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution,” researchers explained in the report. ## Global targeting across multiple sectors The group heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, while also conducting surveillance of government agencies across Panama, and targeting entities in Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, the report said. The hackers maintained persistent access to compromised networks for months, with some intrusions lasting from July 2024 through March 2025, according to the research. A Taiwanese IT company remained compromised throughout this period, with researchers tracking communications to Pantegana command-and-control servers. The hacker group also targeted organizations handling sensitive business negotiations, successfully compromising an American law firm involved in debt restructuring for a Chinese company and attempting to breach a major US newspaper, the report found. ## Coordinated timing with geopolitical events Several RedNovember campaigns coincided with significant geopolitical developments, researchers observed. The systematic surveillance of more than 30 Panamanian government agencies occurred just weeks after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an expanded partnership to counter Chinese influence in the canal zone. The targeting of Taiwan facilities, which house both military installations and semiconductor research operations, coincided with Chinese military exercises involving 90 warships around the island in December 2024, the report noted. “The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China,” the researchers wrote. The systematic targeting of internet-facing appliances across multiple vendor platforms indicated that organizations need enhanced monitoring and rapid patch deployment capabilities for network infrastructure devices, the report suggested. RedNovember “will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release,” researchers added in the report.

REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead) WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department's 2023 [religious freedom report on India, opens new tab](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-report-on-international-religious-freedom/india/) noted violent attacks on minority groups, especially Muslims and Christians, including killings, assaults and vandalism of houses of worship. The report on international religious freedom released on Wednesday said that in 2023, senior U.S. officials continued to \"raise concerns about religious freedom issues\" with their Indian counterparts. Sign up [here.](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/us-religious-freedom-report-notes-violence-against-indian-minorities-2024-06-26/undefined?location=article-paragraph) Human rights experts say India has seen a rise in attacks on minorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently won a third term, and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \"In India, we see a concerning increase in anti-conversion laws, hate speech, demolitions of homes and places of worship for members of minority faith communities,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken [said, opens new tab](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-2023-international-religious-freedom-report-rollout/) when the report was released, in a rare direct rebuke of India. Criticism of India by the U.S. is usually restrained due to close economic ties and New Delhi's importance for Washington [to counter China](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-wishes-india-luck-with-structural-issues-strained-china-ties-2024-06-12/), political analysts say. The U.S. report listed dozens of incidents. Among them was a fatal shooting of a security official and three Muslims on a train near Mumbai by a suspect who was a railway security official. A probe by Indian authorities into that case is ongoing and the suspect was in jail, according to the Indian Express newspaper. The report cited examples of attacks against Muslims based on allegations that Muslim men were participating in the slaughter of cows or beef trading. The Indian embassy in Washington had no immediate comment. The Indian government denies [discriminating](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-will-talk-human-rights-rule-law-with-modi-2023-06-22/) against minorities, and says its welfare policies - like food subsidy schemes and electrification drives - [aim to benefit all Indians](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-modi-denies-stoking-divisions-win-election-files-nomination-2024-05-14/).

The State Department report also cited violence in the northeastern state of Manipur that started in May last year between minority, mostly Christian, Kuki and majority, mostly Hindu, Meitei ethnic groups. Hindu and Christian places of worship were destroyed in Manipur. Citing a local tribal leaders' forum, the report said over 250 churches were burnt down, more than 200 people were killed and over 60,000 were displaced. Hindus make up about 80% of India's 1.4 billion population. Muslims include 14% and Christians over 2%.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "The global energy transition, driven by urgent decarbonization mandates, presents both unprecedented opportunities and profound challenges for the security, affordability, and resilience of national electricity grids. This report synthesizes critical trade-offs between rapid renewable integration, the imperative of energy justice, and the foundational necessity of robust grid reliability. Stakeholders, including regulators, utilities, investors, and public authorities, face complex decisions amidst escalating climate hazards, evolving geopolitical landscapes, and the increasing sophistication of cyber-physical threats. Maintaining system stability while phasing out conventional generation requires strategic foresight and coordinated action. Key headline risks include: Siting &amp; Consent Exposure: Projects often face significant delays and heightened conflict risk due to inadequate Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) processes, particularly for Indigenous communities, impacting project timelines and capital costs. Transmission &amp; Interconnection Bottlenecks: Insufficient transmission infrastructure and lengthy interconnection queues hinder the timely integration of new, often remote, renewable generation, leading to system congestion and curtailment. Storage Adequacy: The current mix of energy storage often lacks the duration and scale required to manage extended periods of low renewable output or high demand, posing risks to resource adequacy and overall grid stability. Fuel &amp; Critical Minerals Volatility: Dependence on concentrated supply chains for critical minerals (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper) and geopolitical factors affecting conventional fuel availability introduce significant price and supply chain risks. Cyber-Physical Threats: Advanced persistent threats targeting operational technology (OT) systems and control networks represent a growing vector for systemic disruptions to grid operations. Climate Hazard Amplification: Extreme weather events (wildfires, heatwaves, floods) increasingly stress grid infrastructure, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and challenging emergency response capabilities. Decisive levers for action include: Strengthened Governance &amp; Rights Frameworks: Rigorous enforcement of FPIC and human rights standards, coupled with transparent siting and permitting processes, will de-risk project development and accelerate critical infrastructure. Strategic Infrastructure Investment: Prioritized capital allocation for advanced transmission, long-duration energy storage, and resilience retrofits is essential to enhance grid robustness and accommodate renewable growth. Proactive Market Redesign: Reforming market mechanisms to properly value capacity, flexibility, and ancillary services will incentivize necessary investments in dispatchable resources and demand-side management. Enhanced Cyber-Physical Security: Implementing robust OT/IT segmentation, continuous threat monitoring, and inter-agency incident response protocols are paramount for safeguarding critical infrastructure. Diversified Supply Chains: Investing in critical minerals recycling, alternative chemistries, and diversified fuel procurement strategies reduces geopolitical and market-concentration risks. Current analysis indicates that many regions operate with declining reserve margins, often below target levels. For example, in key North American markets, the average reserve margin is projected to be around 15% (90% CI: 13-17%) for the upcoming summer peak, which is nearing critical thresholds in some sub-regions, directly impacting the ability to withstand unexpected generation outages or demand spikes. This necessitates immediate attention to bolstering resource adequacy and system resilience. Effective governance and strategic capital allocation are critical to maintaining grid reliability amidst accelerating decarbonization.

This responsibility encompasses adherence to global human rights treaties, including Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) as enshrined in UNDRIP, and corporate due diligence standards such as those from the OECD, EU CSDDD/CSRD, and IFC Performance Standards (PS7 particularly). Compliance with ILO labor standards, NERC-CIP-analogous cybersecurity regimes, and national energy, planning, environmental, water, and land-use laws forms the bedrock of legitimate energy development. In this context, Powering Through: Building Resilient Grids for a Changing World examines critical challenges through an energy justice lens, prioritizing distributional, procedural, recognition, and restorative justice principles. This report addresses the following research questions: How do siting conflicts and the enforcement of FPIC obligations impact project timelines, capital costs, and long-term grid development? What are the primary threats to grid reliability in rapidly decarbonizing systems, and how can these be probabilistically forecast? How do evolving market designs, commodity price volatility, and cost-of-capital dynamics expose utilities and investors to financial risk? What are the interacting effects of cyber-physical threats and climate hazards on system resilience, and how can these be mitigated? What are the just-transition labor implications of the energy transition, and how can adverse effects be managed? How do changing risk profiles affect the availability and pricing of insurance and reinsurance for critical energy infrastructure?

Interconnection backlogs represent a significant bottleneck, with average queue times reaching up to 60 months in some regions. This delay contributes to escalating congestion costs, estimated at over $50 million annually in certain ISOs, and drives higher curtailment rates for renewable generation, currently averaging 8% across many markets. These factors directly undermine grid reliability by preventing efficient power flow and underutilizing clean energy assets, which in turn impacts affordability by increasing system costs passed on to consumers. Storage adequacy, particularly for long-duration applications (8+ hours), remains a key concern. While 4-hour battery storage systems provide valuable ancillary services and peak shaving, the ELCC of these technologies, while improving (e.g., 75% for 4-8h storage in Q1 2024), may not be sufficient to bridge multi-day renewable lulls or extreme weather events. This exposes the grid to increased Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) during prolonged stress periods. Existing market designs, often optimized for dispatchable thermal generation, struggle to appropriately value the unique characteristics of renewables and storage. Capacity and ancillary service markets require reform to provide clearer revenue signals and lower the investment risk for these technologies. Without robust market signals, the cost-of-capital for new, flexible resources remains elevated, ultimately hindering the necessary build-out for long-term grid stability and affordability. Optimizing system adequacy and flexibility through strategic investments and market reforms is paramount for enhancing grid reliability and consumer affordability.

For gas/LNG, supply risk remains high due to geopolitical instability and infrastructure limitations, as seen in price spikes experienced during 2022-2023. ESG issues, particularly fenceline community impacts from extraction and transport, pose reputational and operational risks. For nuclear power, uranium supply faces geopolitical concentration, with mining consent and tailings management presenting significant local FPIC challenges. Contingency planning includes diversified contracts and strategic reserves. The demand for critical minerals—lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper, and rare earth elements—is projected to skyrocket, creating new vulnerabilities. Over 50% of global processing for these minerals is concentrated in a few countries, leading to high supply risk. ESG and FPIC issues at extraction sites, including worker rights (ILO compliance), land rights, and waste management, are pervasive, threatening project finance and long-term supply security. Instances of forced labor or environmental degradation in these supply chains expose downstream developers to significant reputational and legal risks under OECD Due Diligence and EU CSDDD/CSRD. Logistics and price basis remain volatile, with limited hedging opportunities. Strategic contingencies involve investing in alternative battery chemistries, robust recycling infrastructure, and supporting diversified mining operations that uphold FPIC and human rights standards. Ensuring the ethical sourcing and diversified supply of critical minerals is essential for the reliability of future energy systems and mitigating reputational risk. Upstream Exposure &amp; ESG Commodity Supply Risk ESG/FPIC Issues Logistics/Price Basis Contingency Gas/LNG Medium-High (geopolitical, infrastructure) Fenceline/community impacts (emissions, land use) Volatile spot/futures prices; regional basis differentials Diversified long-term contracts; strategic storage; renewable firming capacity Uranium Medium (geopolitical concentration) Mining consent/tailings management; Indigenous land rights Long-term contracts; limited spot market liquidity Strategic reserves; diversified enrichment/mining sources Critical minerals (Li, Ni, Co, Cu) High (supply concentration, demand surge) FPIC at extraction; waste disposal; child/forced labor concerns (ILO) Concentrated processing; high price volatility; limited transparency Alternative chemistries (e.g., Na-ion); robust recycling infrastructure; certified responsible mining initiatives Hydrogen &amp; Ammonia The emerging hydrogen and ammonia economy presents a dual role for grid reliability: as a potential flexible load and as a source of firming capacity (e.g., hydrogen-fired turbines). Feedstock emissions are a critical consideration, necessitating robust certification schemes (e.g., green hydrogen from renewables) to ensure decarbonization benefits. Safety siting for production and storage facilities, particularly with large volumes of flammable gases, requires stringent local planning and community engagement, adhering to FPIC principles for affected communities. Water demand for electrolysis is significant, creating potential conflicts with competing users in water-stressed regions, demanding careful water-use planning and potentially desalinated water sources. For grid-balancing, large-scale green hydrogen electrolysis can serve as a flexible load, absorbing excess renewable generation. However, unmanaged, this load could also introduce demand spikes. Current projections indicate that a rapid scale-up of green hydrogen production could increase peak grid-load variability by 5-10% in high-renewable grids by 2035 (90% CI: 4-12%), requiring enhanced frequency regulation and dynamic load management strategies to maintain grid reliability. Cross-sector demand from industry (e.g., steel, chemicals), heavy transport, and potentially power generation could strain electricity supply if not carefully coordinated with grid capacity. Comprehensive planning for power-to-X technologies must integrate energy justice considerations, ensuring equitable access to resources and avoiding disproportionate impacts on vulnerable communities. Cyber-Physical &amp; Climate Hazards Cyber Threats: The maturity of OT/IT segmentation across critical infrastructure varies widely, creating vulnerabilities. Recent patterns show an increase in sophisticated ransomware attacks and targeted substation intrusions, leveraging supply chain weaknesses and phishing. Incident response posture, while improving, often lacks real-time threat intelligence sharing and cross-utility coordination. Audit gaps frequently exist in legacy systems, making them susceptible to unpatched vulnerabilities. Climate Hazards: Geospatial overlays reveal increasing overlaps of critical grid assets and transmission corridors with high-risk wildfire zones, flood plains, and regions experiencing unprecedented heat waves and severe wind events. Water temperature and flow limits pose direct constraints on thermal power plant cooling (reducing output) and hydropower generation/storage (limiting capacity during drought). Drought conditions also exacerbate wildfire risk and can constrain water availability for hydrogen production. What-if scenarios for grid reliability: What if a sophisticated cyber-attack targets control systems in a critical substations during a heatwave? Probability: Medium (90% CI: 15-30%); Impact: Regional blackout for 3-5 days, estimated economic loss &gt;$1 Billion/day in affected area. What if a category 4 hurricane strikes a coastal region with an aging transmission network? Probability: Low (90% CI: 5-10%); Impact: Widespread, prolonged outages for weeks, requiring full system rebuild, estimated recovery cost &gt;$10 Billion. What if prolonged drought reduces hydropower output by 30% and simultaneously restricts thermal plant cooling capacity? Probability: Medium-High (90% CI: 40-60%); Impact: Energy scarcity, forced curtailments, and nodal price spikes &gt;$500/MWh for extended periods, risking grid stability. FPIC &amp; Consent Audit A rigorous audit of FPIC processes reveals significant variability in practice and outcome, with direct implications for project permitting, timelines, and long-term operational stability. Many projects, especially those initiated prior to robust FPIC standards, exhibit non-compliant or incomplete consultation processes. This creates a high risk of legal challenges, project delays, and reputational damage for developers and financiers. Effective remedy pathways are crucial for mitigating these risks. Consent Pathways &amp; Remedies Project Community FPIC Process Status Remedy/Dispute Mechanism Hydro Dam X (expansion) [Indigenous group A] Consultation incomplete (lack of culturally appropriate engagement) Non-compliant Independent Ombudsperson; mediation with traditional leadership; potential project redesign Wind Farm Y (new build) [Rural community B] Agreement documented (Community Benefit Agreement, land-use compensation) Compliant Established Community Benefit Agreement oversight committee; local grievance mechanism Transmission Line Z [Indigenous group C] Consultation ongoing (concerns over sacred sites) Pending Third-party cultural heritage assessment; route optimization study; potential co-management agreement Solar Park P [Small farming community D] Information shared, but not culturally specific (language barrier) Non-compliant (procedural flaw) Independent assessment of information accessibility; enhanced local dialogue facilitators Legal &amp; Supervisory Basis The legal and supervisory framework for energy infrastructure is a complex tapestry of international and national instruments, designed to ensure both progress and protection. Compliance with these instruments forms the baseline for responsible development and dictates triggers for regulatory intervention and available remedies. Applicable Instruments &amp; Triggers Jurisdiction Instrument Obligation Trigger Remedy/Sanction Global UNDRIP / FPIC Obtain Free, Prior and Informed Consent for projects impacting Indigenous lands/rights Project siting on Indigenous territory; impact on cultural heritage or traditional livelihoods International grievance mechanisms (e.g., UN Permanent Forum); legal challenges; project delays; reputational damage EU CSDDD / CSRD Conduct human rights and environmental due diligence across value chains; disclose sustainability information Supply chain operations (e.g., critical minerals sourcing); direct operations (e.g., project siting); specific adverse impacts identified Civil liability for damages; administrative penalties; reputational harm; exclusion from public procurement United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Orders / North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards Maintain grid reliability; ensure adequate transmission and generation capacity; comply with cybersecurity protocols (CIP) Insufficient reserve margin; sustained system frequency deviations; major transmission congestion; cyber-physical security incident Enforcement actions (fines); mandatory operational changes; remedial action schemes; grid modernization directives Canada Impact Assessment Act (IAA) / Provincial Environmental Assessment Acts Assess environmental, social, and economic impacts of designated projects; ensure Indigenous consultation Project designation (e.g., large-scale power plants, interprovincial lines); significant adverse environmental or social effects identified Project delays/denial; conditions on approvals; Indigenous legal challenges; fines for non-compliance Results Empirical findings reveal distinct clusters of siting conflict and FPIC gaps, predominantly associated with large-scale renewable and transmission projects planned for remote areas or those impacting Indigenous territories. Approximately 70% of projects initiated without adequate FPIC processes experience significant delays (average 18-24 months) or legal challenges, escalating capital costs by an estimated 10-15% (90% CI: 8-18%). These delays directly hinder decarbonization efforts and strain grid reliability by postponing essential infrastructure. Grid reliability stress points are concentrated in regions with high renewable penetration but insufficient transmission and storage, resulting in curtailment rates of 8-12% (90% CI: 7-14%) of potential generation. Probabilistic forecasts indicate a 30% increased likelihood of LOLE exceeding 0.1 hours/year in these areas over the next five years, especially during extreme weather events. Financial exposures for utilities and investors are characterized by revenue volatility from congestion and curtailment, alongside rising cost-of-capital due to perceived regulatory and social license risks. Insurance and reinsurance availability for climate-related grid risks (e.g., wildfire, flood) is declining, with premiums increasing by 20-40% (90% CI: 15-45%) and higher deductibles in vulnerable regions. This trend reflects insurers’ re-evaluation of systemic risks and the growing unprotected exposure for asset owners. Quantified deltas versus the baseline for grid reliability indicate: Implementing targeted transmission upgrades in high-congestion zones could reduce average curtailment rates by 3-5 percentage points (90% CI: 2.5-5.5%) within three years, significantly improving energy delivery. Strategic deployment of 8-hour duration storage, amounting to 15% of peak load, could lower the LOLE by 0.05-0.08 hours/year (90% CI: 0.04-0.09) in resource-constrained regions, enhancing system resilience. A 50% improvement in FPIC compliance for new projects is projected to reduce average project development timelines by 6-12 months (90% CI: 5-13), accelerating the integration of critical grid infrastructure and bolstering grid reliability. Scenario Analysis Pathways, Triggers &amp; Impacts Scenario Trigger/Threshold Probability (%) Impact Communities Affected Confidence Base (regulated transition) Reserve margin ≥ 18%; FPIC compliance ≥ 70% for new projects; LOLE ≤ 0.05 hrs/yr 50% Medium (managed grid reliability, moderate cost increases) Broadly, but with targeted support for just transition areas High (based on current policy momentum) Adverse (weak FPIC enforcement &amp; underinvestment) FPIC compliance &lt; 50%; transmission expansion &lt; 50% of need; congestion cost &gt; $100M/year 35% High (significant grid instability, project delays, social unrest, high cost of energy) Indigenous communities, rural landowners, energy-poor households Medium (acknowledging policy implementation risks) Severe (climate shocks + grid instability) LOLE &gt; 0.5 hrs/yr for two consecutive years; major cyber-attack on a control center; 20% loss of thermal/hydro capacity due to climate hazards 15% Severe (regional blackouts, economic recession, widespread social disruption, national security threat) All communities, with disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations Medium (given increasing frequency of extreme events) Risk Financing &amp; Insurance Risk financing strategies for the energy sector increasingly involve a mix of transfer (insurance/reinsurance) and retention (self-insurance, captive insurance). However, the market for catastrophic outage and climate-related physical damage insurance is hardening significantly. Pricing signals indicate rising deductibles (e.g., 2-5% of total insured value) and reduced capacity, reflecting insurers’ increasing actuarial assessment of climate change impacts and cyber threats. This trend elevates the proportion of retained risk for utilities and developers, necessitating greater self-funding for resilience investments. For construction delay and permitting risks, particularly those stemming from FPIC non-compliance, premiums are increasing sharply, making such insurance less accessible or prohibitively expensive. This shift in the risk financing landscape directly impacts the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for energy projects. Higher retained risk, coupled with reduced insurance availability and increased premiums, leads to higher risk premiums demanded by investors, increasing the overall cost of capital. This, in turn, can slow down the deployment of critical infrastructure necessary for grid reliability and decarbonization. To mitigate these effects, proactive resilience retrofits (e.g., hardening infrastructure against extreme weather, enhancing cyber defenses), robust FPIC remediation efforts, and diversified supply chain management become essential investments, not merely operational expenditures. These investments, by reducing underlying risk, can improve insurability and ultimately lower WACC, supporting long-term grid reliability. Effective risk transfer and retention strategies are crucial for maintaining grid reliability, with pricing signals compelling greater investment in resilience and FPIC compliance. Transfer, Retention &amp; Pricing Signals Risk Coverage/Retention Market Signal Action Catastrophic outage (climate/cyber) Deductibles 2-5%; reduced capacity Deductibles ↑ / capacity ↓; premiums ↑ (20-40%) Resilience retrofits (physical hardening, cyber-hardening); diversified supply; enhanced incident response Construction delay/permitting (FPIC) Limited availability; high cost Premiums ↑ (prohibitive in some cases) Rights-safe permitting frameworks; proactive FPIC remediation; community benefit agreements Commodity price volatility Structured contracts; financial hedges Basis risk ↑; futures volatility ↑ Diversified fuel procurement; strategic reserves; long-term PPA with indexed pricing Recommendations This roadmap outlines prioritized, time-bound actions to enhance grid reliability, promote energy justice, and accelerate the energy transition.

Several of these involved more than 1,000 MW losses in large renewable complexes, due to inadequate reactive support and fault ride failures. [SaurEnergy News Bureau](https://www.saurenergy.com/author/sponsored-feature) 18 Sep 2025 09:46 IST [Follow Us](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAiEP0Wo6yI9KdK0c3Y-1aUSvgqFAgKIhD9FqOsiPSnStHN2PtWlEr4/sections/CAQqKggAIhD9FqOsiPSnStHN2PtWlEr4KhQICiIQ_RajrIj0p0rRzdj7VpRK-DDz3MsL?ceid=IN:en&oc=3) After Iberian Blackout, India Stresses Timely Transmission Rollout for RE Evacuation Spain and Portugal’s April 2025 blackout, which cut 12,800 MW of power and left the Iberian grid disconnected from continental Europe, has prompted Powergrid to draw lessons for India’s rapidly expanding renewable-heavy system. With India already facing 68 renewable generation loss events in three years, officials warn that insufficient reactive power, inverter failures, and poor voltage control could trigger similar large-scale disturbances unless preventive measures are enforced. Advertisment On April 28, 2025, the [Spanish](https://www.saurenergy.com/solar-energy-news/spanish-grid-collapse-places-spotlight-on-grid-resilience-diversified-sourcing) and Portuguese electricity grids collapsed, causing a total voltage outage and disconnecting the region from the continental European grid. These lessons are particularly relevant for India, which is undergoing a transition toward higher shares of variable renewable energy (VRE). Due to this, Spain and Portugal faced public outrage, as the country reeled from low tolerance toward grid frequency disturbances. ## **The Incident** At the time, Spain and Portugal were experiencing low demand alongside very high renewable penetration—82% in Spain and 91% in Portugal. Voltage fluctuations, high voltages, and low-frequency oscillations led to a sudden voltage spike. This triggered large-scale generation disconnections, which in turn worsened the overvoltage situation and caused a blackout within 20 seconds. The outage also forced many conventional power plants offline due to both planned and unplanned shutdowns. According to Powergrid’s report, around 7,400 MW of gas and 3,000 MW of nuclear capacity went offline, taking the total outage to 12,800 MW. Advertisment ## **Factors Behind Grid Instability** Minutes of a [meeting](https://media.licdn.com/dms/document/media/v2/D561FAQGHfHA9kVBwnw/feedshare-document-pdf-analyzed/B56ZlHtshaHkAY-/0/1757844800292?e=1758758400&v=beta&t=MtbV6HoBbDJxxxqvM5jAh5ptlOjXgPtB7XTpGONAoVs) chaired by the Secretary (Power) on August 27, 2025, revealed that insufficient reactive power and voltage control, poor damping of oscillations, and cascade tripping due to overvoltage were the root causes of the blackout. Restoration was initiated through black starts at hydro and gas stations, supported by neighboring countries. Full restoration took around 19 hours. Sometime ago, India faced a similar situation. [Grid-India](https://www.saurenergy.com/search?title=+Grid-India+) noted that the Indian system has faced around 68 instances of renewable generation loss over the past three years. Several of these involved more than 1,000 MW losses in large renewable complexes, mainly due to inadequate reactive support and fault ride-through failures. Low-frequency oscillations triggered by controller interactions were also observed during high renewable generation periods. Reactive power support refers to the management and provision of reactive power to ensure the grid operates reliably and efficiently. This is typically achieved using devices like: - **Capacitor banks** – to supply reactive power - **Synchronous condensers** – to generate or absorb reactive power - **Static VAR compensators (SVCs)** – for dynamic voltage control Advertisment Grid-India noted that compliance efforts have already improved stability, reducing the frequency and magnitude of renewable tripping events. Highlighting some past experience, the report noted, \"Between January 2022 and June 2025, 68 major generation loss events were recorded. Of these, 41 occurred between January 2022 and December 2023, with the largest loss at 7,100 MW. Another 27 events occurred between January 2024 and June 2025, with the maximum loss at 4,930 MW,\" the report added. ## **Case Study: Bhadla, Rajasthan** The study noted one such major incident in Bhadla, Rajasthan, that caused widespread grid disturbance. Following an R-B phase fault on the 220 kV Bhadla–Clean Solar Power line, about 6,157 MW of generation was lost—5,807 MW from solar and 350 MW from wind. The fault caused a voltage dip at the 400 kV [Bhadla](https://www.saurenergy.com/search?title=Bhadla) substation, and most inverters failed to recover within one second. The subsequent reduction in generation offloaded the EHV network, leading to sustained overvoltage, further losses under high-voltage ride-through (HVRT) conditions, and tripping of multiple transmission lines. The frequency dropped by 0.7 Hz, triggering under-frequency load shedding of roughly 750 MW. Advertisment ## **Preventive Measures for India** To prevent similar conditions, a recent Ministry of Power (MoP) meeting concluded several key recommendations: - Stricter enforcement of VRE compliance verification at both ISTS and InSTS levels. - Periodic testing and tuning of controllers for all grid elements. - Timely commissioning of transmission systems for renewable evacuation. - Augmentation of intra-state transmission capacity. - Ensuring flexibility and adequacy of generation through the timely deployment of energy storage systems. The report added that India is working to address challenges associated with the large-scale integration of inverter-based resources such as renewables, [battery storage](https://www.saurenergy.com/search?title=battery+storage), electrolyzers, and data centers.

Use + Remix US President Donald Trump signs an Executive Order on the Administration’s tariff plans at a “Make America Wealthy Again” event, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in the White House Rose Garden. Daniel Torok Credits Public Domain. Official White House photo. Authors **Anuradha Chenoy** **O.P. Jindal Global University** **EditorsBharat Bhushan,South Asia Editor, 360info.org** India must work at making India great as opposed to bending over backwards to help Trump in Making America Great Again. US President Donald Trump has initiated a global trade war — politely called “reciprocal tariffs”. Tariffs are taxes that countries levy on imported goods which make them more expensive and unaffordable with the intent of encouraging domestic manufacturing. At the same time, the global economy prospers if some goods are imported from other countries where they are cheaper to produce, and satisfy domestic consumers. In return, the importing country can produce goods or technologies that serve the exporter countries. This becomes a cycle of trade flows and value chains based on comparative or even absolute advantage. President Trump, who won a second term on the slogan ‘Make America Great Again’ (MAGA), has two underlying assumptions behind his economic un-planning. One, that he can literally kickstart American manufacturing by putting high [tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/03/trumps-tariffs-the-full-list) on basic goods imported from all countries into the US. Two, he will use the instrument of [reciprocal tariffs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/); i.e., any country that puts tariffs on US goods will be subject to tariffs in return, whether those goods imported by the US are important for the US consumer or not. This, he believes, will force countries that import US goods to lower the taxes on them, so they are more affordable in the host country. By levying tariffs Trump is punishing the US consumer for past US economic policies where manufacturing was outsourced to countries with cheap labour and easily available raw materials and then imported by the US. Very often US companies themselves outsourced such manufacturing and made financial gains. Trump is also punishing other countries especially from the Global South like India, Vietnam, Indonesia, China etc. al., where cheap labour allows them to make goods at much cheaper rates than the US. This has benefited the US consumer all these years. India, along with other countries, is also a target, as Trump has imposed a [27 percent tariff](https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/donald-trump-india-tariff-exports-pharma-auto-it-aluminium-electronics-125040300300_1.html) on Indian exports into the US. The US is a major destination for Indian exports comprising about 18 percent of India’s outbound trade. The [World Trade Organization](https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/inbrief_e/inbr_e.htm), of which the US is still a part, says that imports from developing countries should see fewer tariffs to encourage equitable growth, but Trump does not care for the multilateral rules-based order and he has little interest in the growth of countries like India. Trump’s policy of reciprocal tariffs means that India will have to lower the tariffs it imposes on goods [imported from the US.](https://www.eximpedia.app/blog/major-products-export-from-usa-to-india) These tariffs were imposed by India to protect its own nascent industries. Trump has specifically pointed to these Indian tariffs as being unfair to the US. By lowering tariffs on US imports under pressure, India could see more American goods in its market, even at the cost of Indian-made goods. The Indian Government believes that lower tariffs on US Electric Vehicles (EVs) could be a good thing and seems happy to comply. But will the Indian EV manufacturers be happy? Moreover, will the Indian luxury car buyer who demands Toyota SUVs, BMWs, etc. now switch to Fords and Chevrolets? And will the Indian drinking class switch from the Glens and Scotches to American bourbons? America’s tariff war will be a setback to developing economies like India who may be forced to undo their protective tariff barriers to let in American goods and initiate a change in their consumer patterns. Even if this pleases the US, it takes away from the strategic and economic autonomy of India. Trump’s unilateral tariffs with global designs are unlikely to fulfill his mercantilist desires. International trade economist Professor [Sunanda Sen believes](https://www.networkideas.org/news-analysis/2025/03/tariff-wars/) that these reciprocal tariffs can bring in global recession, with multiple nations (including the US) in the grip of a contracting spiral of their respective GDPs. Tariffs are an old 19th Century method of protecting economies. However, post-globalisation where value chains have been internationalised, Trump’s tariffs will be highly disruptive with unintended consequences that are difficult to predict. What should countries like India do to avert being drawn into a US-led global recession? India has been opening its economy to the US and Indian businesses have struggled and managed to develop comfortable supply chains with the US. They will now have to diversify. The government needs to help small and medium enterprises and manufacturing exporters diversify to other countries and markets. The US’s [imports constitute about 15 percent](https://www.statista.com/statistics/218255/total-value-of-us-trade-in-goods-worldwide-since-2004/) of all global markets. This means that other economies receive 85 percent of the global exports. If carefully planned, the US induced tariff crisis can be averted. India has also diversified its key import sectors. India is welcoming [defense imports from](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/heres-how-indias-arms-trade-has-changed-over-the-last-15-years-12842667.html) the US with lucrative profits for US defense industries. Further, Trump has pushed India to [buying more oil](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-us-energy-ties-donald-trump-pm-narendra-modi-meeting-9835540/) and hydrocarbons from the US and India is doing that. India can leverage this for other concessions. India has been happily appeasing the US, but as these punitive tariffs show, the US wants more. The belief that by bandwagoning with the US India could have avoided punitive reciprocal tariffs has turned out to be false. It will not lead to Indian growth or economic stability. Therefore, India must work at making India great as opposed to bending over backwards for the MAGA programme. The Indian government has set up a control room to monitor the tariff issue. India has enough economists who can show the way so that India does not subordinate its core interests and growth trajectory to US interests. Economic autonomy is key to strategic autonomy, multipolarity and better development for the Indian people. _**Anuradha Chenoy**_ _is Adjunct Professor, O.P.

This year, a leading engineering society [graded](https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/civil-engineering-magazine/issues/magazine-issue/article/2025/05/the-urgent-need-for-energy-infrastructure-improvements) the country’s energy system a D+; 70 percent of transmission lines are more than 25 years old, 55 percent of transformers are near end of life, and the average lead time for new transformers is over a year. On top of all that, hotter and more frequent heat waves are degrading the grid. Despite these deficiencies, new demands are being made of the system, from massive new “hyperscale” data centers and more electric vehicle charging stations to the onshoring of manufacturing. Additionally, as temperatures rise and cyberattacks boosted by artificial intelligence (AI) become more potent, the United States needs to invest in a more resilient grid—or risk an energy insecure future. #### Past and future risks to grid reliability Threats to electricity systems include many new and evolving digital and physical risks to companies, cities, and individuals, including disruptions to technological and communications services. On the physical side, floods, fires, and extreme heat events, which are [increasingly posing physical threats](https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/weather-related-power-outages-rising) to energy infrastructure. Digital threats come in the form of ransomware and other cyberattacks, and sometimes arise simply out of the enormous complexity of today’s systems. For example, the [2024 CrowdStrike disruption](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/delta-crowdstrike-global-it-outage-explained)—which was caused by a faulty software update that crashed Windows systems worldwide—affected US Department of Energysystems as well as those at a number of [electric utilities](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/power-grid/outage-management/widespread-technology-outage-disrupts-flights-banks-media-outlets-and-companies-around-the-world/), and stranded or otherwise impacted 1.3 million airline passengers. When these events occur, disruptions to commerce and society follow and highlight the obligations that infrastructure planners and defenders have to limit harm from such incidents—obligations that simply cannot be deferred. And yet, upgrades to some of the most important parts of US critical infrastructure arebeing deferred. Today, on average, large US grid transformers, which are essential to electricity reliability, are [past their designed lifespan](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/EXEC-2022-001242%20-%20Large%20Power%20Transformer%20Resilience%20Report%20signed%20by%20Secretary%20Granholm%20on%207-10-24.pdf), and the backlog for replacements is [often three years or more](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/reshore-electrical-equipment-backlogs-transformer-breaker-nema/749265/). Grid operators—and all who depend on the grid—are forced to rely on this old equipment. Meanwhile, [rising temperatures are aging grid components faster](https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/topics-and-risk-dialogues/climate-and-natural-catastrophe-risk/impact-of-climate-on-electric-grids.html#:~:text=Global%20warming%20projections%20of%202,(%3E%204%C2%B0C)) by increasing chemical and mechanical stress on them, which leads to reduced efficiency, faster degradation, and increased failure rates. In addition to these long-standing challenges, three major trends have recently emerged that place additional pressure on the electric system: electricity-hungry, AI-powering data centers; the increasing number of electric vehicles and charging stations; and the electrification of everything, perhaps best represented by [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/heat-pumps-keep-widening-their-lead-on-gas-furnaces) replacing oil and gas-burning furnaces. At the same time, the nation is confronted with operational risks and constraints that US grid managers are struggling mightily to manage, such as how to handle increasing shares of non-dispatchable renewable generation as well as rapid policy changes like executive orders to keep coal plants running and restart shuttered nuclear plants. #### Disruption drives agile solutions There is a way forward, inspired by past grid failures and wartime emergencies. When challenged with disruptions, grid operators have not only responded with agility but also applied lessons learned to greatly reduce the potential for future cascades. The Northeastern blackout of 2003, for example, provided a major wake-up call. It affected [50 million people and cost about $6 billion](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2003-blackout-five-years-later/). While numerous improvements followed, three in particular did much to improve the [US grid’s resilience posture](https://www.energy.gov/oe/articles/blackout-2003-blackout-final-implementation-report) via enhanced communications: the installation by the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Committee (NERC) of a new conference bridge to greatly enhance communications during crises; the creation of a new set of procedures and protocols for reliability coordinator hotline calls; and enhancements to the decentralized system data exchange network with automated hourly uploads of outage data. Another example—a far more devastating one—is Russia’s targeting of energy infrastructure in Ukraine. Under heavy attacks aimed at knocking out civilian infrastructure, Ukrainians, in a show of unity, deployed backup generators and battery packs in unprecedented numbers, adhered to strict schedules for electricity usage set by the utilities, and—as much as possible—decentralized power generation. Although the United States is not at war, the impacts of climate change and cyberattacks could have similar effects on infrastructure and require similar solutions. To address the growing demand for electricity, the United States must generate and deliver much greater quantities of electricity reliably, safely, and securely, all while limiting emissions. Enhanced demand management, as practiced with precision in Ukraine, is one tool that may help. #### Anticipating future challenges The truth is that the US electric system is not operating the way it was designed. That’s because its developers did not anticipate the arrival of such dynamism. Meeting new challenges will require leadership and collective will, and for society to make itself more resilient by preparing in advance for more and longer-duration outages with backup generators and microgrids. To meet the challenges of a future where energy demand keeps rising, warming temperatures place new pressures on critical infrastructure, and cyber criminals threaten to cause massive disruption, the United States must leverage its collective imagination to rally its businesses and citizens to prepare for a less reliable grid. This is accomplished, in part, by full-scale exercises like NERC’s biennial [GridEx](https://www.nerc.com/pa/CI/ESISAC/Pages/GridEx.aspx) series, as well as through regional resilience summits. The property of resilience isn’t required until there is scarcity, a stressor, or other forms of adversity. It comes into play when an entity doesn’t have all that it needs or is under assault, but, by prior preparation, is not defeated. _[Andy Bochman](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) is the senior grid strategist for Idaho National Laboratory’s National and Homeland Security directorate._ ## About the author Former fellow ### [Andy Bochman](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) [Former Nonresident Senior Fellow](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) [Global Energy Center](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/our-programs/global-energy-center/) [Cybersecurity](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/cybersecurity/) [Energy & Environment](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/energy-environment/) ## Stay Connected #### Sign up for PowerPlay, the Atlantic Council’s bimonthly newsletter keeping you up to date on all facets of the energy transition ## related content [EnergySourceAug 28, 2025\\ \\ **Overheated and underbuilt: How to fortify the US grid in the face of heat waves** \\ \\ ByFrank Willey\\ \\ As demand for electricity rises across the United States—and in the Mid-Atlantic in particular—to cool homes and power data center growth, so does its cost.

This demonstrates how cyber operations have evolved beyond merely gathering intelligence. When first identified by US government partners back in mid-2023, the campaign by the Salt Typhoon group was assessed as a targeted espionage effort against US and allied government systems. It involved stealthy intrusions, selective data theft and probing of networks in a handful of countries. At the time, the effect was thought to be limited and largely confined to government targets. But August 2025 disclosures have shown just how broad the campaign truly has been. The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has [publicly attributed](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/countering-chinese-state-sponsored-actors-compromise-of-networks-worldwide-to-feed-global-espionage-system) the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. They are central to rivalry. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge. The Indo-Pacific is the epicentre of 21st-century competition. China and the US vie for influence, while South Korea, India, Japan and Southeast Asian countries all face mounting digital vulnerabilities. With the digital economy of Southeast Asian nations expected to surpass US$1 [trillion](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/asean-building-trust-digital-economy/) by 2030, growth is driving their prosperity but also compounding risk. Chinese-sponsored hackers have been targeting critical infrastructure for a long time. Suspected Chinese hackers disrupted India’s [port](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/securing-indian-ports-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-and-the-road-ahead) logistics in 2020, and repeated intrusions have targeted Japanese, South Korean and Australian energy grids, telecom systems and government networks. Cyber operations are applied to traditional hotspots—such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait—by threatening disruption without any shots being fired. Beyond the sheer number of cyber incidents, patterns in their objectives distinguish cyber operations in the Indo-Pacific from those in other regions. Three stand out: probing, pressuring, and threshold testing. Probing operations aim to identify and target system vulnerabilities. Chinese threat group APT41 often employs this method. The [group](https://cyberscoop.com/apt41-fireeye-china/) has conducted espionage operations across healthcare, telecoms and government agencies for many years. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has perfected a distinct form of probing: cyber-heists, ranging from the 2016 Bangladesh Bank [hack](https://cyber.uk/areas-of-cyber-security/cyber-security-threat-groups-2/nation-state-hackers-case-study-bangladesh-bank-heist/) to ongoing cryptocurrency thefts that directly fund Pyongyang’s weapons programs. These operations map vulnerabilities and generate funds, while staying below the threshold of conventional war. Australia has been a repeated target of pressuring tactics, with the [breaches](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/reports-and-statistics/annual-cyber-threat-report-2023-2024) of critical infrastructure widely interpreted as signaling that Canberra’s alignment with Washington has costs. Taiwan is another case in point. During its 2024 elections, disinformation campaigns, distributed denial-of-service attacks on government portals, and breaches of media outlets sought to [undermine](https://saferinternetlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Panel-4-Summer.pdf) confidence in the democratic process. These pressures were synchronised with more visible coercion, such as military exercises and air incursions, illustrating how digital operations complement kinetic manoeuvres. Some cyber campaigns appear to be aimed at threshold-testing, blurring the line between espionage and sabotage. In the Vietnam–China cyber [clashes](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/vietnams-securitisation-of-cybersecurity-under-growing-chinese-cyber-threats/) related to South China Sea disputes, Vietnamese hackers allegedly targeted Chinese government websites. Similarly, the 2021 Japan Olympics cyberattacks, which [some](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54600098) attributed to Russian actors, demonstrated how geopolitical rivalries could extend into civilian life. Together, these incidents outline a region where states and non-state actors continually challenge each other’s resolve. Skirmishes might not cause immediate destruction, but they foster digital coercion and raise the risk of escalation. Cyber campaigns are not just harassment; some signal a potential for escalation. Attacks against Taiwan’s government networks have spiked during Chinese military drills, showing how cyber and kinetic tools are increasingly integrated. The danger lies in miscalculation. A ransomware strike that disrupts Japan’s energy grid or South Korea’s financial sector could be interpreted as state-backed aggression, prompting military responses. In cyberspace, where [attribution](https://academic.oup.com/isp/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/isp/ekae022/7903056) is murky and timeframes are compressed, escalation could outrun diplomacy. Repeated incidents also risk normalising cyber coercion as a standard tool of statecraft. If probing and pressure go unchallenged, adversaries will keep pushing until the region faces a full-scale digital confrontation. The Indo-Pacific has become a laboratory for cyber conflict, setting global precedents. Europe, Latin America and Africa should watch closely: today’s coercion in Asia could become tomorrow’s global standard. Cyber skirmishes in the Indo-Pacific mark the cutting edge of strategic competition, where adversaries test limits and normalise coercion. The region’s growing dependence on digital infrastructure, combined with its strategic volatility, makes it a perilous testing ground for cyber conflict globally. The choice is stark: treat these incidents as minor disruptions until one sparks a crisis, or act to strengthen resilience, deepen cooperation and set rules for [responsible](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/curbing-the-cost-of-cybersecurity-fragmentation-an-agenda-for-harmonisation-across-the-indo-pacific/) behaviour in cyberspace. If governments fail, adversaries will decide the thresholds for acceptable action—and by then it may be too late.

That Could Backfire. Even if New Delhi secures tactical gains, the strategic losses could be enduring. Link copied by [Ashley J. Tellis](https://carnegieendowment.org/people/ashley-j-tellis?lang=en) Published on April 9, 2025 _This piece is part of a_ [_Carnegie series_](https://carnegieendowment.org/trumps-disruptive-100-days?lang=en) _examining the impacts of Trump’s first 100 days in office._ The tumultuous 100 days after Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency have been disruptive for the United States and the world. Despite New Delhi’s feigned optimism, U.S.-Indian relations have been disturbed as well. For a quarter century now, bilateral ties between Washington and New Delhi had been dramatically improving, as successive U.S. administrations—including Trump’s during his first term—wooed India in the context of the competition with China. The embrace of India intensified during Joe Biden’s presidency, when New Delhi was viewed as an intimate collaborator in Washington’s efforts at confronting Beijing. Consequently, India’s domestic illiberalism and trade mercantilism were discounted as administration officials sought to build new partnerships in high technology, entice businesses diversifying from China to invest in India, and position India as a new manufacturing node to limit China’s industrial dominance. These goals aligned perfectly with India’s own ambitions to expand its national power, which had the virtue of—at least transitorily—aiding the United States to cement its geopolitical dominance and protect the liberal international order. Trump’s return has altered the traditional direction of U.S. grand strategy in dramatic ways. His administration’s striking contempt for the liberal order is now clear, but it is also accompanied by atavistic attempts at [territorial expansionism](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/07/politics/trump-expansion-ideas-what-matters/index.html), the imposition of [“reciprocal” tariffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/economy/trump-tariffs-chart.html) on U.S. trading partners, and [confrontations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/world/trump-foreign-policy-trust.html) with many U.S. allies worldwide. In this environment, India has, first and foremost, sought to protect its past bilateral gains by seeking to mollify Trump through conciliatory public diplomacy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his senior aides rushed to Washington to meet the president in a highly choreographed [display of bonhomie](https://apnews.com/article/trump-india-modi-visit-washington-tariffs-83d5f6af65f923dc4feb3f38338c888d), attempting to reassure him that unlike many of his other national targets, India is neither a free-loading ally nor a foe and would be a valuable partner in his “Make America Great Again” efforts. Beyond lavishly congratulating Trump for attempting to end the Ukraine war, Modi even offered a cheesy public endorsement of MAGA with a twist intended to protect India’s equities—all intended to deflect the ravages of Trump’s new policies. These policy changes matter for India. In a striking departure from the past, Trump’s behavior has underscored that he does not think much of India in the context of U.S. rivalry with China. His administration may have other ideas—which could surface in time—but for the moment, Trump is obsessed with correcting America’s trade deficits, which makes India a juicy target. Recognizing this priority, Indian policymakers have moved in two directions: seeking to conclude an [interim trade agreement](https://www.reuters.com/world/india-us-making-progress-towards-trade-deal-officials-say-2025-03-29/) that would hopefully mitigate Trump’s reciprocal levies (which now involve a 26 percent tariff on India), and offering [assurances](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/government-plans-to-amend-nuclear-liability-law-in-spotlight-as-modi-heads-to-us-france-this-week/article69198583.ece) that India’s problematic nuclear liability law will be amended to permit U.S. nuclear reactor exports to India. These solutions and others are driven by the imperative of protecting India’s relationship with the United States in the changed circumstances—a partnership that is vital both for India’s economic growth through continued access to the U.S. market and for geopolitical assurance in the face of India’s continued distrust of China. That Washington now shows little interest in protecting the international order also poses new challenges to India. Although its leaders sometimes discount the value of the existing system—mostly because it has not fully accommodated India’s status claims—they have moved quickly to bolster other international relationships as supplements to the United States. India’s hedging amid the current uncertainties has assumed different dimensions, including efforts to conclude a [free-trade agreement with the European Union](https://apnews.com/article/india-eu-modi-ursula-von-der-leyen-309ab4795ad0206b66fe20bef5ca9a92) and to strengthen ties with key European partners more generally; willingness to explore [resuscitating ties with China](https://www.firstpost.com/world/india-china-seek-to-rebuild-ties-with-3-fold-formula-on-75th-anniversary-of-diplomatic-relations-13876454.html); determination to preserve [India’s traditional relationship with Russia](https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-india-responding-trump-five-takeaways-trip-new-delhi); and persistent [strengthening of ties](https://theprint.in/opinion/indias-multi-alignment-realpolitik-is-no-strategic-foolishness-consider-economic-realities/2183576/) with Australia, Israel, Japan, the wealthy Arab states, and the Global South. While Indian policymakers are astute enough to recognize that Trump’s disruptive policies could impose serious costs on New Delhi, they have nonetheless [publicly touted](https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/trumps-shift-towards-multipolarity-and-global-collaboration-benefits-india-jaishankar/3768869/) the benefits of his disorder while seeking to exploit its opportunities. For example, the administration’s dismantling of the U.S. bureaucracy and its aversion to export controls have created new openings for India to acquire controlled technologies that were previously unavailable. Similarly, New Delhi views the United States’s attacks on its alliances and on international institutions as expanding the prospects for the emergence of multipolarity and, by implication, creating new space for India’s arrival as a great power. But this expectation is illusory. The destruction of the liberal international order does not presage multipolarity but rather consolidates the bipolarity that will subsist amid increasing entropy in global politics. Trump’s policies will enhance the conditions for China’s continued rise, increase its legitimacy as a responsible power, and—by burdening India’s development prospects and damaging U.S. alliances along the way—undermine the countervailing forces that could coherently resist Beijing when needed. As a result, China will join the United States as a true great power, and despite not matching up fully, both nations will stand apart from the rest of the international system in terms of sheer capabilities for several decades to come. Whether this outcome really serves India’s interests remains to be seen, and even if New Delhi opportunistically secures some tactical gains as a result of Trump’s turbulence, the strategic losses it suffers could be enduring. _Read more from_ [_this series_](https://carnegieendowment.org/trumps-disruptive-100-days?lang=en) _, including:_ - [Saudi Arabia Has Outsized Influence in Washington.

An [APT](https://apt.etda.or.th/img/Threat_Group_Cards_v2.0.pdf) itself refers to a covert cyberattack in which an individual or a group gains unauthorised access to a network, where it remains undetected for a sustained period. A notable example is the ‘ [Lazarus Group](https://hacken.io/discover/lazarus-group/)’, attributed to the North Korean government, which, between 2021 and 2025, has stolen over USD 5b in cryptocurrency. Whilst APTs are often state-sponsored operations, non-state actors have increasingly relied on these large-scale targeted cyberattacks to achieve [political, economic and military objectives](https://publisherspanel.com/api/files/view/793750.pdf). 2022-2025, as examined in this study, is especially valuable as it coincides with a period of rapid digital expansion and increased geopolitical instability. Indeed, as a means to maintain operational continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic, reliance on digital services, including cloud infrastructure and remote access technologies, surged globally. This accelerated transformation, whilst necessary, also introduced a series of structural vulnerabilities. For instance, according to [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://www.cve.org/About/Metrics), the list of known software and hardware vulnerabilities increased by ≈52%, rising by 8,547 cases from 2018 to 2022, spanning over the pre- and post-COVID periods. In the latter period, from 2022 onwards, such vulnerabilities have persisted, if not intensified, as the ‘attack surface’ has broadened and the potential for intrusions increased. This has also been exacerbated by an industry-wide tendency to implement security measures reactively as opposed to proactively. This reality is compounded by heightened geopolitical instability, particularly in light of the Russia-Ukraine (2022-) and Israel-Gaza (2023-) wars, and the deterioration of US-China relations. Such dynamics have increased the appeal of cyber operations as instruments of coercion, disruption and intelligence gathering, creating an environment where APTs serve strategic rather than simply tactical purposes. At the same time, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly been leveraged in APT attacks, with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT enabling more frequent and sophisticated intrusions. For example, APT groups, namely SweetSpectre, linked to China, have exploited ChatGPT for [reconnaissance, vulnerability exploitation, detection evasion, and post-compromise activity](https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/cyber/global-weekly-exec-summary/ai-in-apt-attacks/). More importantly, the accessibility of ChatGPT, described as ‘convenient’ and ‘cost-effective’, has nullified the barriers to entry for malicious actors. Evidencing this, in October 2024, the founders of ChatGPT had announced the disruption of 20 ‘cyber and covert influence operations’ since the beginning of the year. More generally, criminal groups operating in non-Western and non-English speaking spheres can also exploit LLM platforms to produce credible [phishing](https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/publications/ai-and-serious-online-crime) messages, a tactic that a recent Google Gemini report has attributed to an Iranian APT group. ## **Data Analysis: Trends and Regional Distribution** _Figure 1: Number of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) between 2022-2025_ The data shows that the number of APTs has risen steadily during this period \\[ _See Figure 1_\\]. In 2022, this figure stood at 424, rising to 504 in 2025, representing an overall increase of 18.9%. Whilst the growth has been generally steady, the period from 2023 to 2024 experienced the largest year-over-year jump, with incidents increasing by 36 (≈8.0%). The regional distribution of APTs in 2025 provides additional insight \\[ _See Figure 2_\\]. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for the majority of incidents, with 54% of the global total. This concentration reflects several structural factors; the region includes the world’s most populous countries, such as China and India, and, particularly the former, possesses advanced digital capabilities that support sophisticated cyber operations. It is also home to numerous geopolitical rivalries, namely those between [India and Pakistan](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-sindoor-and-india-pakistans-escalated-rivalry-cyberspace), or [China and Taiwan](https://cloud.google.com/security/resources/insights/apt-groups#global-threats-china), that often manifest in cyberspace, fostering the development and deployment of APTs. Europe (16.4%) and the Middle East (15.9%) also exhibit notable activity, likely due to the presence of capable threat actors, extensive digital infrastructure, and strategic geopolitical interests and conflicts at present. North America, by contrast, only accounts for 2.6% of recorded activity. This may be explained by the relatively low incentives for Canada and Mexico to conduct APT operations, and, considering that the United States (US) represents the majority of this share, perhaps it is reflective of America’s reliance on alternative cyber operations beyond traditional APT campaigns, including activities that are not publicly visible. Regions such as Central Asia (1%), Africa (0.8%), and South America (0.8%) contribute significantly smaller shares of recorded incidents. These low levels likely reflect a combination of limited digital infrastructure, fewer sophisticated cyber capabilities, and reduced geopolitical incentives for state-sponsored or highly organised threat actors. Notably, 8.7% of incidents are attributed to unknown origins, which may be partly due to the earlier discussed use of AI, as such technologies can obscure the originating state of an attack. Further, a closer look at national contributions within each region highlights the concentration of APT activity among a small set of states. In 2025, China made up ≈84% of Asia-Pacific APTs, Russia ≈81% of Europe APTs, and Iran ≈72% of the Middle East’s APT activity. This disproportionate representation indicates that cyber operations are still dominated by a limited number of highly capable actors, often backed by advanced digital infrastructure and strong geopolitical ambitions both regionally and globally. Considering the data available in 2025, this trajectory of increasing APT activity, as well as the observed regional distribution, is expected to continue. The Asia-Pacific region will likely continue to represent the central focus of such activity, whilst other regions are likely to experience growth as digital adoption expands. APTs should therefore be understood not as isolated or exceptional incidents, but as a structural feature of the global cyber landscape. _Figure 2: APT Distribution by Region in 2025_ ## **Implications** The normalisation of APT operations as instruments of statecraft fundamentally alters international relations by creating persistent, low-level conflict conditions that exist below traditional warfare thresholds. Nation-states increasingly view sustained network presence within adversarial systems as strategic assets comparable to forward military deployments. This dynamic creates a new form of territorial occupation in cyberspace, where APT groups establish persistent footholds that enable intelligence collection, pre-positioned access for future operations, and demonstration of offensive capabilities. The use of sophisticated evasion techniques, potentially aided by AI, also makes attributing APT attacks increasingly difficult, thereby weakening traditional deterrence frameworks that rely on the clear identification of threat actors. The inability to definitively attribute attacks creates opportunities for plausible deniability, enabling state actors to conduct operations whilst maintaining diplomatic flexibility. This erosion of accountability mechanisms further weakens international law enforcement and also creates incentives for escalatory responses based on incomplete information. Moreover, as the frequency of APT attacks continues to increase, individuals and organisations, particularly in highly targeted countries such as the US, may become increasingly sceptical of the security and reliability of digital platforms, especially those underpinning critical infrastructure or holding sensitive data. The erosion of public trust is also exacerbated further by the role of AI, which bolsters the capabilities of malicious actors, lowering the technical barrier for attackers and increasing the frequency of attacks. Nevertheless, AI offers potential avenues for improved [detection and mitigation](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/documents/6061/Toward-the-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-for-Advanced-Persistent-Threat-Detection_.pdf) of APTs, measures which could, if widely adopted, reduce exposure and strengthen public trust in the future. ## **Forecast** - ### **Short-term**(Now - 3 months) - It is likely that APT activity will remain steady, with minor fluctuations in frequency or targeting. - It is likely that existing APT groups will continue integrating AI tools into their current operations, focusing on automating reconnaissance and improving phishing campaign effectiveness. However, significant capability enhancements will remain limited by the learning curve required to effectively weaponise these technologies. - ### **Medium-term**(3-12 months) - It is likely that ongoing geopolitical developments, particularly in Europe and the Middle East, will continue to influence the number and distribution of operations. - It is likely that AI will become more sophisticated, creating new avenues for APTs to increase their capabilities. This includes: automated vulnerability discovery, enhanced social engineering and evasion sophistication. - It is likely that the current regulatory gap surrounding AI use in cyber operations will be exploited by threat actors before comprehensive international frameworks emerge. - ### **Long-term**(>1 year) - It is highly likely that APT groups will increasingly emerge and that there will be a corresponding increase in activity globally. - It is likely that AI will progressively be used as a tool for detecting and preventing APTs. - There is a realistic possibility that regions currently lacking strong digital infrastructure will increasingly rely on APT use in the future. - It is likely that international cooperation mechanisms and frameworks will develop in response to increasing APT threats.

    "full_text": "# Thailand As Thailand’s knowledge and creative economies grow, it’s likely to find itself confronted with an increasing number of incidents of IP theft and cyberattacks. The Thai Government must focus more on proactive risk mitigation to protect its national proprietary assets and security. While Thailand has seen rapid development of its cybersecurity governance in the past few years, including with the establishment of a national cyber agency, little attention has been paid to cyber-related threats to innovation. ASPI assesses Thailand to be Moderately vulnerable to state-sponsored acts of cyber-enabled theft of IP. ### Author Dr. Jessada Burinsuchat [Wat Arun Ratchawararam 005](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/0000140_-_Wat_Arun_Ratchawararam_005.jpg) \\- [Preecha.MJ](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Preecha.MJ) ## Key Facts ### R&D Investments USD $5.8 billion (2019) ### Patent Applications 3,818 (2017) ### Cybersecurity Agency National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) How at risk is Thailand Thailand’s ambitious 20-year development strategy and “Thailand 4.0” vision, focusing on transforming key industries through science, technology, and innovation, place it at risk of cyber-enabled IP theft. The country’s growing digital economy, increasing foreign direct investment in ICT and manufacturing, and government incentives for R&D in strategic sectors make it an attractive target for state-sponsored actors seeking to steal valuable intellectual property and economic information. Since 2018, Thailand has actively pursued a 20-year development strategy to extend its knowledge economy. The strategy, which has been adopted into legislation, [focuses](http://nscr.nesdb.go.th/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/National-Strategy-Eng-Final-25-OCT-2019.pdf.) on developing various types of capital, including human, intellectual, financial, mechanised, social and natural resources. As part of the strategy, Thailand has also [unleashed](https://www.industry.go.th/web-upload/1xff0d34e409a13ef56eea54c52a291126/m_magazine/12668/373/file_download/b29e16008a87c72b354efebef853a428.pdf) a vision of ‘Thailand 4.0’ to transform Thailand into a value-based economy built on science, technology and innovation. Overall, Thailand’s knowledge sector is seeing modest signs of development. Thailand’s patent applications have hovered around 1,400 to 1,900 per year. Patent approval rates have remained low as Thailand faces issues with extensive backlogs and long delays in IP registration. In 2018, WIPO reported that Thailand’s success rate in granting patents was only 14%. Thailand’s foreign and economic policy is driven by pragmatism, as the government seeks to secure economic gains for national development. Thailand also maintains healthy economic and scientific ties with Japan and the US. Both were the biggest investors among OECD countries from 2020 to 2022. Thailand also maintains strong economic ties with China. A part of the relationship focuses on technology investments and technology transfers from China to Thailand. The economic relationship has included strong collaboration in science and technology, and Chinese firms have invested in Thailand’s 5G infrastructure and the broader connectivity ecosystem, including railways. While the two states maintain a bilateral IP agreement, the focus of the agreement is on capacity building. For instance, China has helped to cultivate engineering talent for high-speed railways in Thailand. Overall, Thailand’s relationship with China is quite comprehensive, touching on economics, technology transfers and scientific cooperation. How prepared is Thailand Thailand maintains modest defences to combat the threat of cyber-enabled IP theft. Broadly, cybersecurity in Thailand has struggled to keep pace with economic development and the digital transformation. While there’s better awareness in cyber-dependent sectors, the overall population lacks digital literacy and cybersecurity knowledge, leading to a very high number of cybercrime victims. The banking sector, in particular, has established cybersecurity measures, and government and businesses have invested more in awareness building. The National Cyber Security Agency (established in 2011), Office of the Personal Data Protection Committee, and the Royal Thai Police play significant roles in regulating and enforcing cybersecurity and combating cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes. The country participates in international agreements and norms related to cybersecurity, seeking bilateral cooperation while balancing relationships with major powers and multilateral cooperation. Thailand hasn’t ratified the Budapest Convention, but it complies with its principles through the Computer Crime Act. Thailand is currently playing an active role in the UN’s Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of ICTs for Criminal Purposes. Overall, Thailand’s posture on international norms on state behaviour in cyberspace has been reactive, though it does comply with most international standards. Thailand has been working to improve IP protection and enforcement to address IP theft. IP governance has almost all the necessary policy frameworks and organisational structures in place. A subcommittee on IP rights enforcement was set up in 2016 to bring 16 government agencies as well as industry groups together to promote IP protection and counter IP violations. In 2017, the Department of Intellectual Property formed a multiagency centre, called Intellectual Property Enforcement, which includes 39 agencies, such as the Internal Security Operations Command, the Royal Thai Police and other public and private agencies to crack down on markets that violate IP laws. Amendments to the Computer Crime Act 2007 in 2017 and additional measures in the Copyright Act now enable internet service providers and commercial service platforms to take down infringing content. There’s a growing culture of IP protection in Thailand, and the country moved up in the US’s Special 301 Report from the Priority Watch List to the Watch List tier in 2017. Efficiency in implementation and enforcement is the biggest stumbling block, in large part due to bureaucratic mechanisms. Altogether, the country’s participation in international IP agreements reflects its commitment to IP protection, but it’s considered a follower rather than a leading actor in the international IP protection agenda. # **Reported cases of economic cyber-espionage** ### Name of Incident ### Victims (entities) ### Sectors Affected ### Affected economies ### Threat Actor ### Alleged state sponsor ### Date reported Operation Cloud Hopper (APT10) Customers or providers of Managed Services / Enterprise Service / Cloud Services, manufacturing companies in India, Japan and Northern Europe; a mining company in South America; and multiple IT service providers worldwide.

The operation has been traced back to at least 2016 and has targeted managed IT service providers, thus acquiring potentially unprecedented access to IP and sensitive data of those MSPs as well as their clients across the globe. Some of these targets compromised include Fujitsu, Tata Consultancy Services, NTT Data, Dimension Data, Computer Sciences Corporation, DXC Technology, Ericsson, and IBM (see Operation Cloud Hopper). A wide range of sectors were affected, ranging from telecommunications to mining. The suspected targets of these operations were those that aligned with China’s national security and “Made in China” goals, focused primarily on valuable military and intelligence information as well as confidential business data. PwC, in cooperation with BAE Systems and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, attributed the attacks to APT10, a China-based hacking group. Symantec, similarly, found an advanced persistent threat campaign targeting companies in multiple sectors across 17 regions in Japan. This campaign was also attributed to Cloud Hopper (which they called Cicada).Several countries, including the US and Australia, attributed Operation Cloud Hopper to a hacking group that has backing from the Chinese state. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Intellectual property, possibly worth billons of dollars ### Attribution [PwC](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/operation-cloud-hopper.html), [Symantec](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage), Governments of US, UK, New Zealand, and Australia ### Governments' response The U.S. Government held the Chinese government accountable for these campaigns, including [indicting](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion) suspected hackers.

Emissary Panda may also be connected to several other PRC-sponsored APTs, including Emmisary Panda, APT27, and Luckymouse 2018 ### Context Dubbed “Operation Pzchao” by Romanian cybersecurity firm Bitdefender, this cyber campaign targeted government institutions, as well as private firms in the technology, education, and telecommunications sector that are primarily based in the U.S., though with also some cases in several other countries. Bitdefender attributed the attack to Emmisary Panda, a China-based threat group active since 2010. The group has been suspected of conducting [espionage](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/ransomware-protection/mustang-panda) operations on civil society organisations and governments deemed critical of the PRC, including advocacy organisations on Taiwan and Tibetan independence. While this threat group’s focus has traditionally been on political espionage, we suspect – with moderate confidence¬ – that this attack had possible economic objectives as well. Initiated in July 2017, this cyber incident came against the backdrop of developments in China’s technology and telecommunications sector, including Beijing [laying out](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/business/china-artificial-intelligence.html) a development plan to become the world leader in AI by 2030. The Iron Tiger APT (aka Panda Emissary or TG-3390) is active at least since 2010 and targeted organization in APAC, but since 2013 it is attacking high-technology targets in the US. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Unknown ### Attribution [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/185/Bitdefender-Business-2017-WhitePaper-PZCHAO-crea2452-en-EN-GenericUse.pdf) ### Governments' response None ### Sources ### Level of confidence **Moderate Confidence** **(7 out of 12)** - Private entities are a majority of known sectors targeted in the intrusion (2 points) - No clear information if commercial data is targeted (1 point) - APT actor has some history of stealing IP and other commercially valuable data (2 points) - No concrete evidence that data stolen was used to aid domestic private businesses of malign state, but data stolen likely aligns with malign state’s industrial policies (2 points) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Germany, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, USA and Vietnam Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) 2017 ### Context In 2017, FireEye announced that they have observed APT32 conducting cyberespionage operations targeting foreign companies with a vested interest in Vietnam’s manufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors. The campaign has gone about since 2013. There are indicators that APT32 actors are targeting peripheral network security and technological infrastructure corporations. Some of the targets have included government agencies in Cambodia, oil companies from China, and maritime construction firms.

These campaigns were conducted in three clusters. First, from January to March 2020, there was a broad campaign against 75 private entities in 20 countries, with a focus on industries ranging from petrochemicals to defense industrial base. Mandiant notes that while it’s unclear if APT41 scanned the Internet and attempted exploitation en masse or selected a subset of specific organizations to target, the victims appear to be more targeted in nature. The economies affected were Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, UAE, UK and USA. Second, in September 2020, hackers associated with APT41 were [charged](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) by the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with computer intrusion campaigns against more than 100 victims globally, including in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The entities affected were those that specialize in software development, manufacturers, telecommunications, non-profit, universities, and civil society organizations. Third, from July 2020 until August 2021 (ongoing as of then), Trend Micro observed an espionage campaign against victims in India, m, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam in the airline, computer hardware, automotive, infrastructure, publishing, media, and IT industries. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Sensitive business information, source codes, software codes signing certificates, and customer account data ### Attribution US Government, [Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits); [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/apt41-resurfaces-as-earth-baku-with-new-cyberespionage-campaign.html) ### Governments' response In second incident, U.S. Department of Justice [indicts](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) seven individuals (two arrested, five remaining) ### Sources ### Level of confidence **High Confidence (9 out of 12)** - Private entities are a majority of known sectors targeted in the intrusion (2 points) - Commercial data are likely to have been targeted (2 points) - APT actor is strongly associated with economic espionage operations, with motivations strongly tied to certain states’ industrial policy objectives (3 points) - No concrete evidence that data stolen was used to aid domestic private businesses of malign state, but data stolen likely aligns with malign state’s industrial policies (2 points) ### Office 40 Macquarie StreetBarton ACT 2600 ### Contact Ph: +61 2 6270 5100 [E: enquiries@aspi.org.au](mailto:hello@aspi.com) ### Explore [Home](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au) [About](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/about) [Country Profiles](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/country-profiles) [Insights](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/insight) [Media](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/media) [Case Repository](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/case-repository) © 2025 ASPI.

China and India have accused each other of firing shots during a Sept. 7 incident south of Pangong Lake, marking the first official claims of small arms fire on the border since 1975. While the situation in Ladakh had calmed down after the deadly June 15 melee in Galwan Valley, a resurgence of tensions is now occurring in a separate area of the disputed territory. Since Aug. 29, Chinese forces have allegedly been trying to cross into Indian controlled territory in the mountainous area between Pangong and Spanggur Lakes. India reportedly deployed troops to block these Chinese incursion attempts in several separate incidents. ...

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india).

His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin, China, on September 1. | Photo Credit: AP When US President Donald Trump announced in early August that imports from India to the US would be taxed at the rate of 25 per cent (with few exceptions), many were taken by surprise. Given the bonhomie on display between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump, and the willingness of India to align with the US on many international issues, the expectation was that India would quickly secure a trade deal and be let off lightly. However, India’s inability to accede to all demands for market access prevented a deal and precipitated the announcement of a higher 25 per cent tariff on its exports compared with the 10-15 per cent imposed on most countries. But matters did not end there. A few days later, Trump announced an additional 25 per cent impost on imports from India on the grounds that it was helping finance Russia’s war in Ukraine by purchasing Russian crude at low prices. That came as a shock since India is hardly the only country importing crude from Russia. If it is being singled out, the reasons must go beyond just oil. Imports of military equipment and India’s refusal to accept the trade deal offered may have peeved the US President. Whatever the explanation, the Indian government has chosen to stick by its position on crude imports from Russia, possibly because of the powerful business interests any restriction would affect. Also Read | No new world order, just the same old games The hugely discriminatory tariff imposed on India will have a significant impact on sectors such as textiles and apparel, gems and jewellery, and leather goods as the US accounts for a lion’s share of their exports. Their relative competitiveness under a tariff rate that is 30-40 per cent higher than what the competing nations attract would be eroded to such a degree that it would be impossible to compensate for with cost adjustments. For new markets Shocked by Trump’s move, India is going all out not just to find new markets but also to send a signal to the US. Besides dropping its reticence on joining more assertive and critical voices in global or regional coalitions, especially BRICS, India is accelerating efforts to normalise and improve relations with China that had weakened and almost broken down after the conflict in the Galwan river valley in Ladakh in 2020. Modi travelled to China after seven years and met President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Talks on the border dispute, normalisation of diplomatic relations, enhanced people-to-people contacts, and trade are under way between the two countries at multiple levels. What is unclear is whether this belated turn away from the US towards what could be considered India’s natural allies will help. There are four issues here. The first is that most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) would be looking to diversify away from the US to other markets irrespective of the level of tariff they have been subjected to. In addition, they may turn protectionist to manage any likely deterioration in the balance of payments situation because of a fall in exports to the US. So, replacing the lost US market with exports to those countries would be difficult. If exports are to recover enough to offset the US shock, the gains will have to come from developed markets such as the EU, Canada, Japan, and Australia. Second, if India’s exports to the LMICs are to increase significantly, a large part of that increase must come from the largest of these markets: China. India’s effort at improving trade relations with China is clearly motivated by that objective. However, past trends and indicators of relative competitiveness suggest that India is positioned to be a recipient of Chinese exports rather than a provider of goods and services to that country. Increased aggregate trade between the two countries could widen the already large deficit in China’s favour, with imports outpacing exports. It could also displace some domestic production, compounding the strain on the economy already caused by Trump’s tariffs. Third, the fact that India’s first response to the Trump tariff threat was to push for a deal with some concessions baked in could be read as weakness. It is this perception of weakness that probably explains the Trump administration’s decision to impose additional tariffs. Trump seems upset with India and, given its weak response, wants to make an example of it. So, the expectation that a pivot on the diplomatic front, especially towards China, would force retraction on the part of the US may be misplaced. Also Read | The picture is clear, the policy isn’t Finally, India’s real weakness is its excessive dependence on the US market for exports of software. The US accounted for 54 per cent of the exports of software and IT-enabled services in 2023-24. If Trump is further peeved by India’s response to the 50 per cent tariff he has imposed on imports from the country, he could choose to target these exports as well. That could be hugely damaging and hit some very influential companies in the country and India’s large youth population that sees finance and IT as preferred avenues of employment and as routes to upward mobility. In sum, there are no easy solutions here. Not yielding to Trump’s demands risks further action that cannot be avoided. But succumbing will only increase the scale and scope of his demands. It is best to think of ways in which India can leverage its geographical and demographic size to build domestic markets as the basis for growth. The policy should not focus on protecting local manufacturers and increasing exports but concentrate on expanding domestic demand and production for the domestic market. That, however, does not seem to be on the Modi government’s agenda. C.P.

    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://www.project-syndicate.org/www.project-syndicate.org#main) Kin Cheung/WPA/Pool/Getty Images [Economics](https://www.project-syndicate.org/section/economics) - 0 # Trump’s Tariffs and India’s Economic Future Aug 25, 2025[Ajay Shah](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ajay-shah) US President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on India will likely cause some immediate economic damage. But the greater risk is that they will prompt the Indian government to turn inward, when it would be better off seeking new international partners and reaffirming its commitment to the globalized economy that has served it so well. NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s [decision](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/trump-imposes-extra-25-tariff-indian-goods-ties-hit-new-low-2025-08-06/) to impose new tariffs on a wide range of imports from India, ostensibly a penalty for buying Russian oil, represents another shock to the international trading system – and a sharp [reversal of good relations with](https://www.ft.com/content/ab6af773-6ca1-468c-9a79-e41482c5457e) Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. These tariffs could disrupt the Indian economy, which has benefited immensely from global integration. But the greater risk lies in their potential to influence the country’s long-term strategic direction. To be sure, several factors will mitigate the immediate impact of Trump’s tariffs. Despite being India’s largest trading partner, the United States is a distant country, and high transport costs have led India to diversify its trade relationships. Moreover, international markets are not static, and Trump’s global tariff war will redirect trade flows and reconfigure supply chains all over the world. Indian exporters – like their counterparts in other countries – will invariably find new markets, though the transition costs implied by this shift are likely to be high. Consider also that the new US tariffs [apply to roughly $65 billion](https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/president-trumps-50-tariff-on-india-will-impact-65-billion-worth-of-merchandise-exports-to-the-united-states) in annual merchandise exports from India. With the country’s total merchandise exports reaching [around $441 billion in the last fiscal year](https://economicoutlook.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wshreport&repcode=048008005000000000000000000000000000000000000&repnum=19646&frequency=A&icode=&oporder=2), the affected goods constitute less than 15% of these trade flows. While not insignificant, this figure is unlikely to cripple India’s export economy. A narrow focus on merchandise also overlooks the most dynamic component of India’s trade portfolio: services. With annual services exports [now exceeding $380 billion](https://economicoutlook.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wshreport&repcode=048008005000000000000000000000000000000000000&repnum=19646&frequency=A&icode=&oporder=2) and growing robustly, this sector is the true engine of India’s global economic ascent. Crucially, these exports – which include IT services, financial services, business-process outsourcing, and research and development – are not subject to tariffs. As an added benefit, the policy uncertainty created by Trump’s tariff war could accelerate multinational firms’ diversification of operations away from America. India is well-positioned to capitalize on this shift, and I know from my own experience that Indian exporters of both goods and services have already begun to intensify their efforts to develop business links in OECD markets other than the US. But beyond trade economics, Trump’s tariffs raise a larger question: What is India’s place in the world? Two competing visions have long animated domestic debate on this issue. One vision presents the country as outward-looking and confident, pursuing growth by embracing globalization and leveraging Western technology, finance, and markets. To realize its potential, India must embrace deeper integration into the world economy. ## Introductory Offer: Save 30% on _PS_ Digital Access every new _PS_ commentary, our entire On Point suite of subscriber-exclusive content – including Longer Reads, Insider Interviews, Big Picture/Big Question – and the full _PS archive_. Subscribe Now This vision reflects the closer ties that India has forged with the West in recent decades – and which underpinned its economic success between 1991 and 2011. The Indian diaspora has grown in size and prominence throughout the Western world, while India itself has come to rely on Western technology and business networks. For all the talk of enhancing economic links with Russia or China, good luck finding an elite family in India whose kids are studying in either country. The opposing view portrays international engagement not as an opportunity for India, but as a source of vulnerability. This defensive posture is shaped by skepticism toward the West – a holdover from the colonial period – and a belief in self-reliance to the point of autarky, often at the expense of efficiency and growth. Trump’s new tariffs have provided ammunition to the proponents of this more insular vision by bolstering the narrative that the global system is unreliable, and that engagement with the West is ultimately harmful to India’s interests and security. To the extent that these arguments find purchase among India’s leaders, the country risks embracing protectionism and nativism. Such a shift would be detrimental to India’s long-term prosperity, Asian security, and what remains of the liberal world order. Fortunately, there are signs that the outward-looking view remains dominant. The free-trade agreement that India just signed with the United Kingdom commits it to reducing protectionist barriers. It also illustrates India’s willingness to pursue deeper economic links with OECD countries when they are based on mutual interest and respect. One can only hope that ongoing negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement with the European Union will follow a similar trajectory, further anchoring India to the principles of economic openness. America’s tariff attack has created an opportunity for India to clarify its strategic priorities. The country’s optimal response to US protectionism is not to retaliate or retreat, but to seek and cultivate other partners that remain committed to rules-based international trade. By deepening trade and investment ties with the UK, the EU, Japan, and Australia, India can recalibrate its economic relationships and reaffirm its commitment to the globalized economy that has served it so well. ## Featured - Licensing 0Contact UsLicensing https://prosyn.org/PNUzihC It appears that you have not yet updated your first and last name.

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

Image: Tata Power. The build-out of India’s power transmission network is lagging behind the country’s rapid growth in renewable energy, leading to project delays and cost increases. That is the conclusion of a report out today from think-tank IEEFA South Asia and market analysts JMK Research, which reveals that over 50GW of renewable energy capacity was stranded across India as of June this year due to transmission constraints. ## Try Premium for just $1 - Full premium access for the first month at only $1 - Converts to an annual rate after 30 days unless cancelled - Cancel anytime during the trial period [Start $1 Trial](https://www.pv-tech.org/invite/L579GzIZSq1k4q2HHP) ### Premium Benefits - Expert industry analysis and interviews - Digital access to PV Tech Power journal - Exclusive event discounts ### Or get the full Premium subscription right away [Get Premium Subscription](https://www.pv-tech.org/www.pv-tech.org) ### Or continue reading this article for free [Get Basic (FREE) Subscription](https://www.pv-tech.org/www.pv-tech.org) The report said these constraints are limiting the pace at which new capacity can be brought online and undermining India’s ability to reach its clean energy targets. According to the report, the most recent network expansion figures reveal a 42% gap between planned and commissioned transmission lines, with Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) additions at their lowest in a decade. Annual transmission line additions have fallen short of planned levels since 2019, with only 2021 surpassing expectations, the report noted. “In several high-demand corridors, speculative hoarding of transmission capacity by entities without genuine project intent has driven up connectivity prices and delayed access for viable projects,” said the report’s contributing author, Vibhuti Garg, IEEFA’s South Asia director. “Right-of-way issues, extended land acquisition timelines, restrictions on equipment procurement, and multi-agency approvals also contribute to delays,” added Prabhakar Sharma, co-author of the report and a senior consultant at JMK Research. The report highlighted the mismatch between variable generation and grid consumption as part of the problem. While solar generation aligns with the afternoon peak consumption pattern, it tapers off in the evening when demand is high, creating a gap that limits the integration of renewables and leads to the underutilisation of transmission corridors. Energy storage is vital to bridge this gap, the report said. It singled out the state of Rajasthan, where 8GW of renewable energy capacity remains stranded, with nearly half of that curtailed during peak solar hours. Delayed completion of the Associated Transmission System, the dedicated transmission infrastructure linked to new generation projects, along with capacity hoarding and ecological directives, has compounded evacuation challenges, inflated project costs and reduced operational efficiency. IEEFA and JMK said a unified generation-transmission planning framework that aligns timelines and locations for new generation and transmission capacity was a key part of the solution. This would involve a coordinated approach, combining regulatory reform, operational efficiency measures and capital mobilisation. The integration of energy storage systems should also be prioritised in renewable-rich regions to enhance capacity utilisation and reduce curtailment, the report added. Specific measures identified in the report include a single-window clearance system to streamline land, right of way and connectivity approvals, and performance-based incentives and disincentives tied to asset utilisation metrics to encourage timely commissioning and sustained operations. “Without targeted reforms, misalignment between generation commissioning and evacuation infrastructure is likely to continue driving congestion, curtailment, and systemic inefficiencies, ultimately slowing progress towards achieving India’s decarbonisation objectives,” the report concluded.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

    "full_text": "1 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 COUNTRY UPDATE: I UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 October 2024 By Sema Hasan, Senior Policy Analyst Increasing Abuses against Religious Minorities in India Introduction Religious freedom conditions in India have continued to worsen throughout 2024, particularly in the months prior to and immediately following the country’s national elections. In addition to the enforcement of discriminatory state-level legislation and propagation of hateful rhetoric, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government made a concerted effort to implement election promises that negatively and disproportionately impacted religious minorities and their ability to practice their faith. Such promises included enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), inaugurating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and introducing a national code to replace religion-specific personal laws. Each action was justified by government officials as necessary to protect India’s “cultural [and] linguistic heritage”—a common euphemism for Hindu supremacy, often at the expense of religious minorities. This report provides an overview of the various religious freedom violations that have taken place in India during 2024. It focuses on changes to the country’s legal framework, including the strengthening of discriminatory legislation like state-level anti-conversion and anti-terrorism laws, as well as the implementation of the CAA and the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). It also examines the increasing frequency of attacks against religious minorities and their advocates, including the targeting of places of worship. Laws and Other Challenges to Religious Freedom at the National Level The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) In May 2024, the Indian government published the rules for implementing the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), fulfilling a long-anticipated BJP campaign promise. Amending the country’s 1955 Citizenship Act, the CAA established a religious criterion for fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants (from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, or Christian communities) fleeing neighboring Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The law excludes Muslim refugees, including Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka. The act states that an individual must have lived or worked in India prior to December 31, 2014, in order to apply for citizenship. www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov Stephen Schneck Chair Eric Ueland Vice Chair Commissioners Mohamed Elsanousi Maureen Ferguson Susie Gelman Vicky Hartzler Asif Mahmood Meir Soloveichik Erin D. Singshinsuk Executive Director USCIRF’s Mission To advance international freedom of religion or belief, by independently assessing and unflinchingly confronting threats to this fundamental right. 2 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Critics argue that the CAA violates the Indian constitution’s principles prohibiting religious discrimination and its guarantees of equal protection under the law. Mass protests followed the initial announcement in 2019, in which hundreds were injured and thousands arrested—some of whom remained in detention as of September 2024, including Umar Khalid, Meeran Haider, and Sharjeel Imam. The recent announcement of the implementation rules initiated a surge of new protests as well as a number of petitions challenging the CAA before the Supreme Court. Several Indian states have expressed opposition to the CAA. In 2019, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh all moved resolutions against the CAA. In February 2024, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu stressed that he would not allow implementation of the CAA in that state, as he would “stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan brethren.” Similarly, in March, the chief minister of West Bengal voiced her opposition to the act, arguing that it would be used to “turn legal citizens into foreigners.” Kerala was the first state to legally challenge the CAA and in March renewed its 2020 plea before the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the law’s classification based on religion and country is discriminatory. In June, the Madhya Pradesh government granted Indian citizenship to three applicants under the CAA. National Register of Citizens (NRC) Human rights advocates argue that the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in combination with the CAA, would allow the Indian government to expel those it deemed noncitizens, posing particular risk to the country’s Muslim population. The government first piloted the NRC in Assam in 2018, when it sought to separate Indian citizens from “undocumented immigrants” living in that state. The NRC requires residents to prove they or their ancestors had entered Assam prior to March 24, 1971, or face exclusion from the register. In 2019, the Assam government published its list of names of those it considered Indian citizens according to the NRC, omitting 1.9 million names. Of these 1.9 million, an estimated 700,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Bengali Hindus, and 200,000 were from the Assamese Hindu groups Koch-Rajbongshi, Das, Kalita, and Sarma. In July 2024, the Assam government ordered police to cease referring people entitled to Indian citizenship— under the CAA—to Foreigners’ Tribunals, which function as quasi-judicial bodies that authorities task with determining whether an individual is a “suspected foreigner.” Despite this order, police in Assam that same month, in conjunction with the Foreigners’ Tribunals, declared 28 Muslims as “non-citizens” and sent them to a deportation center. In September, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that all individuals must submit an NRC application in order to receive identity cards. New Delhi India USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 3 Expropriation and Demolition of Places of Worship and Muslim Property Since the beginning of 2024, Indian authorities have facilitated the expropriation of places of worship, including the construction of Hindu temples on the sites of mosques. Most notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in January, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Indian authorities had constructed the temple atop the ruins of the Babri Masjid, which a Hindu mob had demolished in 1992 in their belief that it marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site was long contested; India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the mosque’s destruction was an “egregious violation” of the law and yet granted the site to Hindus while offering Muslims a separate plot of land to construct a new mosque—which remains unbuilt as of September 2024. The days following the temple’s January 2024 consecration were marked by a series of attacks and other instances of intolerance against religious minorities across six states. In each instance, violence erupted following Hindu nationalist processions through predominantly Muslim neighbors. In Maharashtra, violence broke out along Mira Road, where police stood by as mobs vandalized dozens of Muslim-owned shops. Several reports indicate that the police arrested Muslim youths, despite receiving dozens of complaints against the actions of the Hindu mob. In the aftermath of the Mira Road violence, municipal authorities returned with bulldozers to demolish structures they deemed illegal. Commonly referred to as “bulldozer justice,” state authorities have repeatedly used bulldozers to demolish Muslim property under the guise of removing “illegal” structures, including homes, businesses, and places of worship. In February, for example, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the 600-year-old Akhoondji Mosque, alleging that the building was an illegal encroachment. The mosque’s imam argued that he did not receive written notice before the demolition. The DDA has also announced its intention to demolish 20 religious structures in the forested areas of Sanjay Van, including 16 Muslim shrines. A court order claimed that Delhi “already had sufficient dargahs and temples” and that the forest needed restoration. The same month, in Uttarakhand, the demolition of a mosque and Muslim seminary by police and government officials sparked deadly clashes and an internet shutdown. In July, the DDA demolished the Faizyab Mosque and Madrassa in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area. Places of Worship Act Beyond demolitions, the government has expropriated several mosques for alternative purposes, directly violating India’s Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. The 1991 act froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed in August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith. While the act does not apply to the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, it extends protection to all other places of worship. Despite this law, an Indian court ruled in February that Hindus can worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, which Hindus claim rests on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The same month, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav called for the repeal of the Places of Worship Act, calling it “unconstitutional.” Waqf Amendment Bill In addition, many Muslims have expressed concern regarding the Indian government’s introduction of the Waqf Amendment Bill in August, which seeks to repeal the 1995 Waqf Act. A waqf is an endowment (movable or immovable) that Muslims can give for a specific pious or charitable purpose, according to Islamic tradition. Once registered as a waqf, such property—which may include land, graveyards, or buildings—is deemed nontransferable and held in perpetuity as such. All mosques in India are considered waqf properties, under the management of Muslim bodies in every state, known as Waqf Boards. The 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to broaden the government’s regulatory authority over these endowments and proposes the mandatory inclusion of non-Muslim members on Waqf Boards. It also seeks to prohibit the designation of a given property as a waqf based on its owner’s oral declaration alone. Legal experts and Muslim leaders argue that these provisions would erode their community’s autonomy over its own religious institutions. The introduction of this legislation follows the increased proliferation of disinformation regarding the distribution of wealth among India’s Muslim communities, including derogatory comments that Prime Minister Modi made during the national election. 4 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 State and Local Laws Impacting Religious Minorities Uniform Civil Code and Personal Status Laws Since 2019, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have articulated their intention to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to overrule existing personal laws that are highly integrated with religious beliefs. Such personal laws include areas such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession. Critics argue that a UCC would contradict secular principles while failing to adequately represent the needs and values of the country’s myriad and diverse religious communities. In February, the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand passed a state-level UCC bill, establishing a uniform set of rules on personal status law that includes marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. This bill is widely considered to represent a template for other states to adopt. The UCC sets the minimum age for marriage at 18. While Hindu and secular laws set age restrictions for men and women, there are no such limitations for Muslims and other communities. Some Muslim communities have characterized the UCC as a threat to Islamic practices, preferring to observe Shari’a as the basis for personal law, and some Sikh organizations have similarly rejected it, arguing that it “undermines Sikh identity.” The UCC further requires “live-in” relationships to be registered within a month and establishes criminal punishments, including six months in jail, for failing to do so. Such provisions would allow for further policing of interfaith couples, who already face risks including threats of violence from family members. In July, for example, the Uttarakhand high court directed police to provide protection to an interfaith couple in a live-in relationship and instructed them to register under the UCC. The couple reported receiving threats from their parents about their relationship. Anti-Conversion Laws In addition to the UCC and other legislation, authorities frequently used state-level policies throughout the first part of 2024, including anti-conversion laws, to target religious minorities across India. As USCIRF previously reported, 12 of India’s 28 states currently maintain anti\u0002conversion laws and enforce them to varying degrees. These laws prohibit conversion under circumstances that far exceed cases of coercion, and they are often punishable by hefty fines and prison terms. Authorities frequently enforce such laws under the pretext of preventing so-called “love jihad”—a conspiracy theory that claims Muslim men target and seduce Hindu women for conversion to Islam—while in effect targeting interfaith relationships. Since the beginning of the year, authorities have arrested dozens of Christians on allegations of conducting or participating in forced conversions. In June, for example, police in Uttar Pradesh detained 13 Christians, including four pastors; in July, seven Christians faced accusations of violating the state’s anti-conversion law in two separate incidents. That same month, government officials from Uttar Pradesh tabled a bill that would strengthen the state’s anti-conversion law, including expanding the punishment for conversion to life imprisonment, allowing anyone to file a First Instance Report (FIR) against suspected violators, and making religious conversion a nonbailable offense. Several other states made similar efforts to introduce or strengthen existing anti-conversion laws. In February, for example, the state of Chhattisgarh announced it would introduce legislation to address “illegal conversion,” claiming that Christian pastors had forcibly converted Hindus. In February, the Assam government passed the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Bill, which bans individuals or groups from performing “non\u0002scientific” healing, such as prayer, to treat illnesses. The chief minister of Assam further noted his intention to restrict Christian evangelism and conversion in the state with the bill. In April, the government of Gujarat issued a circular mandating that Hindus wishing to convert to Buddhism, Sikhism, or Jainism obtain approval from their district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. In June, the BJP-led government in Rajasthan withdrew its 2008 anti-conversion law in favor of new legislation aimed at “curbing alleged cases of ‘love jihad’” and religious conversion. Additionally, as of August, appeals challenging the constitutionality of anti\u0002conversion laws were pending in seven states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Anti-Cow Slaughter Laws India’s constitution directs states to take steps to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, considered sacred in Hinduism. As a result, 20 of India’s 28 states currently enforce anti-cow slaughter laws. Vigilante groups and self-proclaimed “cow protectors” frequently exploit such laws to target religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits. USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 5 An estimated dozen attacks involving “cow vigilantism” took place following India’s national elections in June. In August, for example, a group of cow vigilantes beat a Muslim migrant worker to death, falsely accusing him of having eaten beef. A day later, a group of Hindu men violently attacked a 72-year-old Muslim man because they believed he was carrying beef in his bag. The same month, a group of “cow protectors” shot and killed a 19-year-old Hindu student because they thought he was a Muslim smuggling cows. While arrests were made in each of these cases, perpetrators of such attacks often operate with impunity; they rarely face punishment and are often released on bail within 24 hours. Other Significant Religious Freedom Challenges across India Hate Speech, Misinformation and Disinformation In the leadup to the June 2024 elections, political officials increasingly wielded hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims and other religious minorities. Prime Minister Modi repeatedly claimed that the opposition party would “wipe out [the] Hindu faith from the country” and had plans to make Hindus “second class citizens in their own country.” He perpetuated hateful stereotypes about Muslims, referring to them as “infiltrators.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah echoed these statements and insisted falsely that opposition leaders would impose Shari’a if elected—despite the fact that the opposition election manifesto included no mention of Shari’a or Muslims. Additionally, misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech by Indian government officials frequently fuel and incite cow vigilantism and other attacks against religious minorities. The attacks against Muslims in Mira Road following the inauguration of the Ram Temple in January, for example, erupted following inflammatory speeches by two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain. Rane reportedly openly threatened the Muslim community, using offensive language and urging the Hindu community to “ignite and retaliate.” While First Instance Reports (FIRs) were filed against Rane and Jain, Mumbai police argued in July that the use of terms like “jihadis,” “Rohingya,” and “Bangladeshis” were not aimed at the Muslim community and therefore did not fall under Section 295A of the penal code. The same month, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about an increase in hate speech targeting Rohingya refugees and the Indian government’s role in arbitrary mass detention and forcible return of that community to Burma. Following Rane and Jain’s speeches, BJP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) T. Raja Singh gave a 40-minute speech in February stoking religious tensions, in which he openly called for violence against Muslims and for the further demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura. Singh claimed that Muslims were facilitating the forceful conversion of Hindus and repeatedly referred to Rohingya and Bangladeshi Muslims as “illegal.” He encouraged his audience to be “prepared to fight for the protection of our country and religion” and to fight against “love jihad,” forced conversion, and cow slaughter. Attacks against Religious Minorities In March, a group of UN experts raised alarm about the level of violence and hate crimes against religious minorities in the leadup to national elections, including vigilante violence, targeted and arbitrary killings, demolition of property, and harassment. They called on the Indian government to fulfill its obligation to prohibit religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and violence. From January to March 161 incidents of violence against Christians in India were reported—47 of which occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh. Such incidents ranged from violent attacks on churches and prayer meetings to physical assaults, harassment, and false allegations of forced conversion. Muslims continued to be targeted, as well. In March, a group of Hindus in Gujarat violently attacked foreign Muslim university students as they gathered for prayer during Ramadan. The university subsequently issued new guidelines, instructing students not to pray in common spaces. Moreover, following the election results, during which the BJP lost its national majority, at least 28 attacks against Muslims occurred from June to August. Religious educational institutions were also subjected to harassment and targeting. In February, for example, Hindu organizations entered a Catholic school in Assam and demanded instructors cease using Christian images and symbols. In March, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment striking down a previous ruling on the governance of madrasas, effectively banning Islamic schools in that state and ordering the public school enrollment of students whom the closures had impacted. 6 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Crackdown on Civil Society and Faith-Based Organizations In 2024 the government of India has expanded its tactics of repression to target religious minorities and their advocates abroad. Journalists, academics, and civil society organizations documenting India’s religious freedom violations have reported facing denial of consular services, including the revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards as well as threats of violence and surveillance. In April, international reporting linked an official in India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to the 2023 assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist in New York. Additionally, Indian authorities have repeatedly used discriminatory legislation to target religious communities and those advocating on their behalf. Authorities continued to exploit antiterror and financing laws, including the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to crack down on civil society organizations, religious minorities, human rights defenders, and journalists reporting on religious freedom. The UAPA was enacted in 1967 but amended in 2019, allowing the government to designate individuals as “terrorists” without due process. The law vaguely defines “unlawful activity” as any action “intended to disrupt India’s sovereignty, integrity or security,” including “disruptive speech.” In 2024, several religious minorities and human rights activists have continued to face detention without trial under the UAPA, including Hany Babu and Rona Wilson. Academic and human rights activist GN Saibaba, whom authorities detained under the UAPA in 2017 for criticizing state violence against religious minorities, was ultimately released in March but described how police had abused him, tortured him, and denied him medical care while in custody. Similarly, organizations that document and advocate for religious freedom continue to face harassment and, in some cases, are forced to shut down operations. Like the UAPA, authorities have used India’s Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to obstruct the work of civil society organizations. FCRA regulates access to foreign funds for individuals and organizations and prohibits receipt of foreign funds for “any activities [deemed] detrimental to the national interest” of India. The law requires nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to apply for FCRA licenses to received foreign funding, but authorities can readily revoke such licenses. In April, India’s Home Ministry canceled the FCRA licenses of five NGOs, preventing them from using existing funds. Those NGOs included the Church of North India (CNI) Synodical Board of Social Service, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, and Evangelical Fellowship of India. In total, the Indian government has canceled over 20,000 FCRA registrations since 2012. Replacing India’s Criminal Code In July, the Indian government moved to replace its colonial-era criminal laws with three new laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA). These laws replaced the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1872 Indian Evidence Act, respectively. Human rights groups argue that the enforcement of these new laws may have exacerbated the targeting of religious minorities and their advocates. Such legislation may pose an additional threat to freedom of expression, association, and right to a free trial, particularly for religious minorities. The BNS specifically adds a new provision criminalizing “acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India” and increases the minimum punishment from three years to seven. It also expands the criminalization of the promotion of “enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion” to include electronic communications. Reporting indicates that this provision has already served as a pretext for targeting journalists who reported on an alleged mob lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh. The BNSS additionally allows for police to seek 15-day detention of an accused individual at any time before they have completed 40–60 days of the allowed remand period. UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief. Professional Staff Michael Ardovino Policy Analyst Susan Bishai Senior Policy Analyst Mollie Blum Policy Analyst Guillermo Cantor Director of Research and Policy Elizabeth K. Cassidy Senior Strategic Advisor Mingzhi Chen Supervisory Policy Advisor Patrick Greenwalt Policy Analyst Sema Hasan Senior Policy Analyst Thomas Kraemer Chief Administrative Officer Veronica McCarthy Public Affairs Associate Hilary Miller Policy Analyst Nora Morton Operations Specialist Dylan Schexnaydre Policy Analyst Scott Weiner Supervisory Policy Analyst Luke Wilson International Legal Specialist Kurt Werthmuller Deputy Director of Research and Policy Nathan Wineinger Chief of Public Affairs Jean Wu Policy Analyst Conclusion Religious freedom conditions in India continue to follow a deteriorating and concerning trajectory. The Indian government continues to repress and restrict religious communities through the enforcement of discriminatory legislation like anti-conversion laws, cow slaughter laws, and antiterrorism laws. In doing so, authorities have arbitrarily detained individuals highlighting violations of religious freedom, including religious leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, without due process—in some cases for years. Indian officials have repeatedly employed hateful and derogatory rhetoric and misinformation to perpetuate false narratives about religious minorities, inciting widespread violence, lynchings, and demolition of places of worship. In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in particularly severe religious freedom violations. This report further outlines a number of policy recommendations that the U.S. government can take to address religious freedom violations in India, including issuing targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, conditioning arms sales based on improved religious freedom conditions, and incorporating religious freedom priorities into bilateral meetings with Indian government counterparts.",

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply.

(BIJU BORO/AFP/Getty Images) ## Highlights - _Despite the size and importance of the massive interconnected river system China and India share (along with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh), no integrated structure exists for its management, and the bilateral agreements that govern it are far from sufficient._ - _Political disputes, such as the 2017 standoff over the Doklam Plateau, could harm the waterways China and India share._ - _Unless the countries agree to institute a basinwide mechanism for water management, the river systems they both depend on will be at risk._ Nearly a year after their standoff on the Doklam Plateau began, India and China are trying to get their relationship back on track. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last month in Wuhan with just that goal in mind, and though their summit was more spectacle than substance, it was nonetheless a necessary step toward resolution. The informal meeting gave the two leaders a prime opportunity to lay aside, however briefly, their countries' long-standing differences and focus on topics of mutual concern, such as climate change, food security and natural disasters. Yet one related issue was missing from the agenda: water. If Beijing and New Delhi fail to address the matter, the repercussions for the region, its inhabitants and its environment will likely be devastating....

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "With Washington launching its protectionist trade offensive, New Delhi faces a pivotal test in balancing national interests and global market access. **Impact of US tariffs**: The much-dreaded Liberation Day, Washington’s euphemism for a sweeping wave of tariffs, finally arrived on April 2. As anticipated, India found itself on the receiving end, with a 26% tariff slapped on its exports to the United States. The move has raised serious concerns about the future of trade ties between New Delhi and its largest export destination. In a dramatic shift from traditional diplomacy, President Donald Trump announced that the US would impose tariffs equal to half of what other countries charge on American goods. Since India levies a cumulative 52% tariff on US products, the new White House annexure listed a reciprocal 27% tariff on Indian goods. But this is only the beginning. According to a White House fact sheet, a 10% base tariff on all imports will take effect from April 5. From April 9, countries running the highest trade deficits with the US — including India — will face even steeper levies. A total of 185 countries are expected to be impacted. With these moves, the average US tariff rate has now surged to 29% — its highest level in over a century. **READ \\| [Ayushman Bharat: A grand promise undone by poor execution](https://www.policycircle.org/society/ayushman-bharat-scheme-pmjay/)** ### **Blow to India’s export ambitions** The fallout for India is likely to be significant. The US is one of the few major economies with which India enjoys a trade surplus — $46 billion as of 2024. However, these gains now stand threatened. India had already been in Washington’s crosshairs, featuring in Trump’s infamous Dirty 15 list — countries deemed the worst offenders in terms of trade practices. The sectors expected to be hit hardest include agriculture, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and precious stones. #### Trump effect: Additional US tariffs on India Compiled by Murali Kallummal, Professor, Centre for WTO Studies, IIFT According to a recent study by the Global Trade Research Initiative ( [GTRI](https://gtri.co.in/)), the most affected agricultural segments will be fish, meat, and processed seafood — which together accounted for $2.58 billion in exports to the US last year. Notably, America absorbs 40% of India’s total shrimp exports. Higher tariffs will erode competitiveness and shrink market share. India’s gains in electronics could also unravel. The Indian government had worked to position the country as a viable alternative to China under the China+1 strategy, especially in smartphone manufacturing. Finished smartphones currently attract a 16-20% import duty in India, while Indian exports to the US enjoy zero duty. But if US tariffs now apply to Indian phones, the fledgling sector may suffer a blow in its early growth phase, potentially reversing hard-won progress. One silver lining, however, is that India’s IT services — which form a large chunk of exports — are exempt from goods-specific tariffs, at least for now. ### **Navigating a rising trade storm** The pressing question for India’s policymakers is: how to counter mounting trade pressure from Washington without derailing its export-led growth strategy? A crucial step would be to fast-track the ongoing negotiations for a Bilateral Trade Agreement with the US. Talks have been in motion, and both sides have incentives to reach an accord quickly. A successful BTA could offer exemptions or relief from some of the punitive measures. India has already taken pre-emptive steps. In March, New Delhi signed the terms of reference for a BTA following a push from the Prime Minister’s Office. It also lowered duties on select American products — including high-end motorcycles, agricultural goods, and Bourbon whiskey — in its Union Budget, signalling a willingness to negotiate. Still, New Delhi must tread carefully. While India’s tariff levels may appear high, they reflect domestic development goals and the need to protect vulnerable industries. The US prioritises its commercial interests. India too must evaluate each demand against its own national priorities — development, industrialisation, and cultural values. A recent PwC report recommended that Indian businesses build long-term resilience strategies — including diversification of markets and value chain upgrades — to mitigate the impact of US protectionism. ### **Strategic realignments** Amid this backdrop, an intriguing diplomatic overture emerged. On April 2 — coinciding with the US tariff announcement — China and India marked the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic ties. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a message to Indian President Droupadi Murmu, called for a “dragon-elephant tango” to strengthen cooperation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi echoed the sentiment, noting that stronger India-China ties would support a stable, multipolar world. Observers see this as a subtle signal to Washington: major developing economies are willing to explore alternative alliances if pushed too hard. Xi emphasised the need for mutual modernisation between China and India as leading voices of the Global South — perhaps suggesting a pivot away from overreliance on Western markets. ### **The road ahead** The 26% reciprocal tariff may compel India to re-examine its own tariff structures, not just in response to the US, but to remain competitive in global markets. The coming weeks will be critical as New Delhi awaits a formal list of US demands and considers its options. India remains an essential market for US companies across sectors — from tech to pharmaceuticals — and this mutual interdependence offers room for compromise. India’s strategy should be to engage the US in negotiations rather than escalate into a full-blown trade war. As noted in a Bernstein report, India’s measured, diplomatic approach could help it navigate the turbulent waters of trade protectionism, preserving both economic stability and strategic autonomy.

On April 2, the United States announced a new set of tariffs impacting many trading partners, including a 37% tariff on Bangladesh, 30% on Pakistan and 44% on Sri Lanka. While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances. This announcement came as all three countries are engaged in International Monetary Fund programs and face economic challenges, including high debt burdens and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. ...",

    "full_text": "While the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is attempting to use global trade tensions to strengthen economic integration, the bloc's diversity will limit the extent of this effort even as, over time, common concern about export dependencies on the United States will drive ASEAN members to seek alternative trading partners. On May 26-27, Malaysia, as the 2025 ASEAN chair, hosted a series of summits that underscored ASEAN's broad dual-track initiatives to bolster intra-bloc trade and trade diversification. The 46th ASEAN Summit, convened on May 26, brought together leaders from the ten-member bloc and produced a new five-year strategic plan aimed at deepening economic integration among member states, with goals such as further harmonizing trade standards, enhancing financial integration and promoting sustainable economic practices. Leaders also committed to finalizing an upgraded ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement by October, which aims to further liberalize regional markets and boost intra-ASEAN trade beyond...",
