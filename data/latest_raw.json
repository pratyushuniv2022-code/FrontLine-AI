Of these, the threat posed by Naxalism, a Maoist insurrection active in the eastern half of the country for over four decades, is the most overlooked and analytically neglected in Western academic and security circles. In the past seven years, Naxalite activity has grown in scope, breadth, and violence, in a “Red Corridor” stretching from Nepal to Tamil Nadu, and killed or displaced tens of thousands of people. By 2006, the problem was so severe that India’s Prime Minister characterized the insurgency as the greatest internal security threat ever faced by his country. Given India’s bloody history with separatist and communal violence, such a pronouncement is truly startling. This thesis undertakes an historical analysis of the Naxalite movement to assess how great a danger its current iteration truly poses, and what the implications might be for India’s continued rise. Soberingly, it finds that the insurgency is indeed stronger and more dangerous today than at any time in the past. Furthermore, while it does not pose an existential threat to the state in the same way as its counterpart in Nepal, it will prove extremely disruptive to India’s further growth and development if not swiftly and effectively countered. New Delhi’s efforts in this regard are so far unimpressive, but it is not too late to act. The United States has a vested interest in the emergence of a strong and stable India, and may be able to help its new “strategic partner” address the challenge of Naxalism’s resurgence.

PURPOSE “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problem of Naxalism is the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”1 With this startling pronouncement in April 2006, India’s Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, finally drew the West’s attention to an insurgency that had plagued his country for more than four decades, taking nearly 20,000 lives in the process.2 While the world was fixated on the violence in Kashmir, fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and intermittent bouts of Hindu\u0002Muslim sectarian violence, an archaic Maoist ideology, rejected even in the land of its birth, was growing in scope, breadth, and violence. Over the past seven years in particular, Naxalite rebels have come to control large swathes of the Indian countryside in a “Red Corridor” stretching from Nepal to Tamil Nadu and killed thousands of Indian security forces and civilians. This thesis will examine the evolution of the Naxalite threat, from its humble beginnings in 1967 to the present, to ascertain the true danger posed to India’s rise as a twenty-first century Asian power. B. IMPORTANCE Since the end of the Cold War and economic reforms in the early 1990s, India’s performance has been truly staggering. It would be difficult to overstate the key role the country is expected to assume in the global community over the coming decades. With a population of over 1.2 billion, a young, growing, and increasingly educated workforce, and persistent real GDP growth rates in the area of 8 percent over the last decade, India is emerging as a powerful driver of the world economy.3 Its demographic clout and 1 Manmohan Singh, “Prime Minister’s Speech to the 2nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of Chief Ministers on Naxalism,” (speech, New Delhi, India, April 13, 2006), Government of India Press Information Bureau, http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=17128 (accessed August 10, 2007). 2 Jane’s Information Group, “India’s Mosaic of Conflict,” Jane’s Terrorism and Security Monitor, July 14, 2004, http://www8.janes.com/ (accessed August 7, 2007). 3 Ibid. 2 political ambitions are also thrusting it increasingly into positions of international leadership, as the debate on its accession to permanent membership on the UN Security Council attests. If the twenty-first century is truly to be the “Asian Century,” India, along with China, will likely be leading the way. Since the late 1990s, India has also emerged as an increasingly important strategic partner to the United States. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, India was one of the first countries in Asia to extend its support in the Global War on Terror, offering refueling rights to U.S. ships and aircraft on their way toward Afghanistan. The strategic partnership has grown since then, most famously with the 10-year defense accord signed in 2005 and the U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation agreement of 2006.4 The United States has been assiduously cultivating a closer relationship with New Delhi, and greater military and strategic ties between the two countries are clearly important components of future U.S. foreign policy in Asia. However, India’s effectiveness as a world leader and U.S. strategic partner is contingent upon its continued internal stability and economic development. If Naxalism is as great a threat as many believe, its continuing spread will have serious negative repercussions on both fronts, to the detriment of India, the United States, and the larger world. A comprehensive examination and analysis of the phenomenon, and its potential to derail India’s development, is therefore both timely and important. C. LITERATURE REVIEW The Naxalist movement emerged in 1967 as an uprising of disaffected and disenfranchised peasants in Naxalbari, West Bengal. Given its four decade long existence, there is generally a surprising dearth of academic study on the movement. Western scholarship on insurgency in South Asia usually focuses on the conflict in Kashmir and (perhaps surprisingly) the plethora of smaller insurrections in India’s 4 Jane’s Information Group, “Sentinel Security Assessment - South Asia: India, External Affairs,” Jane’s Military and Security Assessments, April 26, 2007, http://www8.janes.com (accessed August 6, 2007). 3 Northeast.5 What little attention is paid to Naxalism is focused almost solely on the underlying causes of insurgent movements in general, treating Naxalism simply as one case in a larger group. Nevertheless, these treatments do provide valuable insight on contributing factors to the movement’s rise and persistence. There seem to be two main schools of thought on this issue. The first is that insurgencies arise out of unmet political demands, usually from a minority that feels it is being oppressed.6 The second school of thought cites economic inequality as a reason for insurgent uprising, typified by the revolts of lower class social groups against what they feel is lack of access to economic gain.7 A third, smaller body of literature stresses the importance of contributing factors, asserting that uprisings are more likely to occur where the terrain provides sanctuary to small groups that can train, equip, and educate their followers outside the reach of government forces.8 In the case of Naxalism, elements of all three theories seem to be at play, and are echoed in the literature from outside the West. Unsurprisingly, the study of the Naxalite movement is more extensive in India itself. Here, however, the problem seems to be not so much a lack of analysis, but the questionable objectivity, quality, and relevance of much of the scholarship. A few works on the early phases of Naxalite activity are extant, but many of these are biased to varying degrees, written by the movement’s sympathizers or even the Maoist revolutionaries themselves.9 Of somewhat greater objectivity are a handful of histories authored by journalists, but their scope, too, is limited to the earliest years of Naxalite 5 Lawrence E.

With respect to more recent analysis, there appears to be relatively little peer- reviewed research on the subject. In its place is a fairly large volume of study, of varying quality, from numerous interested parties and private organizations. While this situation presents a unique opportunity for original research, it also poses the challenge of separating objective, factual analysis from more biased or skewed reporting. Within this latter body of more recent literature, the vast majority of debate focuses on the causes of the current phase of Naxalite insurgency and speculation as to the most effective ways to deal with it. Broadly speaking, two groups with competing viewpoints emerge from all this contention. The first, or “law and order” camp, considers the Naxalite problem primarily a security issue. The main proponents of this point of view are security analysts and researchers like K.P.S. Gill and Ajai Sahni, many of them associated with India-based think tanks like the Institute for Conflict Management.11 While acknowledging socio-economic marginalization as a contributing factor, they view the lack of effective state and municipal policing, poor coordination of security efforts with New Delhi, and lenient policies toward Naxalite groups as the root causes of the insurgency. Citing numerous failed efforts at peace talks with what they view as an intransigent, nihilistic enemy, this group advocates strongly for the active suppression of Naxalism by force, with increased utilization of central government forces if necessary.12 10 For examples, see: Sankar Ghosh, The Naxalite Movement: A Maoist Experiment (Calcutta: Firma K.L. Mukhopadhyay, 1974); Sohail Jawaid, The Naxalite Movement in India: Origin and Failure of the Maoist Revolutionary Strategy in West Bengal 1967-1971 (New Delhi: Associated Publishing House, 1979). 11 The Institute for Conflict Management, “An Introduction,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/icm/index.html (accessed July 19, 2007). 12 Much of the literature generated by these analysts is published on the ‘South Asia Terrorism Portal.’ Organized by K.P.S. Gill, the controversial ‘supercop’ who crushed the Sikh insurgency in Punjab in the early 1990s, the SATP is a comprehensive resource for writings and analysis on terrorism and related security issues in South Asia. In particular, see: K.P.S. Gill, “Imperatives of Justice,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, April 30, 2005, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/07june25pio.htm (accessed July 20, 2007); K.P.S. Gill, “Blood Sweat and Anger,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, July 13, 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/06dailynewsjuly13.htm (accessed July 20, 2007); Ajai Sahni, “The Angry Men of Mao,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, February 4, 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/ajaisahni/dailynews&analysis13022007.htm (accessed July 20, 2007). 5 In contrast, the “development” camp views Naxalism as fundamentally the result of poverty and political disenfranchisement. Represented by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and the Asian Center for Human Rights, and think tanks such as the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, this camp takes a far more holistic attitude toward the most desirable means of combating Naxal violence.13 Stressing the need for poverty reduction, land reform, and better local governance, adherents to this line of reasoning reject government sponsored violence as a solution to the Naxalite problem except in the most extreme circumstances.14 As P. V. Ramana puts it, “If the military option were effective, then the problem should not have resurfaced after the initial Naxalbari uprising was suppressed.”15 Indeed, this group views overly aggressive action on the part of security forces as one of the contributing causes of further radicalization in the countryside. At first blush, the position of Ramana and his cohorts strikes one as an oversimplification of an extremely nuanced security situation. How, for example, is development aid supposed to be distributed if the people in the process of doing so are consistently under the threat of Naxalite attack? The same can be said, however, of the “law and order” argument, and its rather singular emphasis on the use of force to quell an insurgency that doubtless draws much support from the disaffection of the rural poor. Analysis of many prior guerrilla conflicts has certainly drawn attention to the need for addressing the underlying causes of rural discontent in order to draw support away from 13 For examples, see: Asian Centre for Human Rights, “Naxal Conflict in 2006,” Asian Centre for Human Rights Report, http://pdfdownload.bofd.net/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.achrweb.org%2Freports%2Findia% 2FAR07%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Freports%2Findia%2Fnaxal0107.pdf (accessed August 6, 2007); Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, “Left Extremism in India: Naxal Movement in Chattisgarh & Orissa,” Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Special Report 25, June 2006; http://pdftohtml.ganjalinux.org/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipcs.org%2FIPCS-Special\u0002Report-25.pdf (accessed August 6, 2007). 14 Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, “Naxalism and Internal Security in India,” Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Seminar, August 4, 2007, http://www.ipcs.org/newIpcsSeminars2.jsp?action=showView&kValue=2362 (accessed August 6, 2007). 15 Ibid. 6 the insurgent base.16 Additionally, neither group adequately examines the efficacy of previous governmental policies and responses, a rather glaring oversight if one hopes to prescribe a current course of action. Compounding the debate is disagreement on the nature of the threat currently posed by the insurgency. The “law and order” crowd focuses almost exclusively on the movement’s implications for political stability in India, but their analysis tends to be a bit shrill.17 While there has certainly been a greater level of political instability in the regions affected by Naxalism, it has tended to remain in the country’s remote rural areas. Their assertions that the ‘Red Menace’ threatens to split India in two and seriously undermine central authority seems hyperbolic, especially given the fact that the movement draws on, at the most, 10,000 - 20,000 hard-core cadres.18 The “development camp,” by contrast, tends to view the Naxalist threat primarily in terms of its humanitarian dimension. These analysts focus on the recent internal displacement of tens of thousands of rural and tribal peoples, and the atrocities committed by both Maoist rebels and the government security forces, as the insurgency’s greatest dangers.19 While this argument is emotionally compelling, it is by no means clear that this aspect of the threat represents a serious strategic problem for New Delhi in and of itself. India’s population is enormous, and the small percentage directly affected account for only marginal contributions to overall GDP.20 What seem to be greater threats are the larger economic implications of the Naxalite insurgency in the context of India’s growth and development, and its potential for further spread as the social impacts of globalization are felt throughout the country. 16 For an excellent example of this argument, see Jeffrey Race, War Comes to Long An: Revolutionary Conflict in a Vietnamese Province (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1972). 17 Ajai Sahni, “Left Wing Extremism in India: Evolving Strategies for Containment,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, October 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/ajaisahni/crpfdelhi.htm (accessed August 6, 2007). 18 Reuters, “Indian Maoist Violence,” Reuters AlertNet, June 27, 2007, http://www.alertnet.org/printable.htm?URL=/db/crisisprofiles/IN_MAO.htm (accessed August 6, 2007). 19 See the aforementioned Asian Center for Human Rights Report, “Naxal Conflict in 2006” and Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Seminar, “Naxalism and Internal Security in India.” 20 Ibid. 7 As The Economist recently noted, the five states most affected by insurgent violence account for significant mineral deposits and a majority of the nation’s energy resources.21 Also, while Naxalist expansion into the Western and Southern Deccan has received some scrutiny, no serious attention is being given to its possible spread into India’s wild Northeastern states. On initial inspection, the political stability, development level, and demography of this region appear eerily similar to those areas already afflicted by Naxalite violence.22 The fact that the Northeast also contains significant fossil fuel deposits only adds to the threat of the Maoists gaining a foothold.23 Clearly, any worthwhile examination of the dangers posed by Naxalism must take into account the changing nature of the social and economic contexts within which it operates. The analytical oversights and divergences of opinion discussed above are also reflected within the administration in New Delhi, where contradictory statements, confusion, and inconsistent policymaking characterize governmental responses to the most recent Maoist threat.24 As might be expected, these efforts have proven less than effective in countering the Naxalite problem, or even checking its growth in recent years. This manifest intellectual incoherence on the part of leaders, analysts, and policymakers has many causes, but is mainly due to a lack of perspective on the nature of the challenge confronting them. In an examination of the literature on this subject, from all the various points of view, the most striking feature is the absence of any comprehensive historical analysis of the Naxalite movement, the evolution of its organization, aims, and leadership, or how India’s own political, economic, and social development has contributed to (or ameliorated) the virulence of the movement. Given the relatively long lifespan of this 21 Economist, “India’s Politics,” Economist Intelligence Unit ViewsWire, March 19, 2007, http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8875555 (accessed August 7, 2007). 22 Cline, 126-149. 23 Jane’s Information Group, “Sentinel Security Assessment - South Asia: India, Natural Resources,” Jane’s Military and Security Assessments, April 27, 2005, http://www8.janes.com (accessed August 6, 2007). 24 P.V.

With the recent spread of Naxalite activity and the notable concern it has elicited from high levels of the Indian government, this lack of an objective, realistic, and comprehensive examination represents a significant gap in the existing literature on the subject. This thesis will aim to fill that gap. D. METHODOLOGY AND SOURCES This thesis will use the comparative case study method to analyze the evolution of the Naxalite movement and assess the danger posed by the most recent upsurge in Naxalite activity. To draw an important distinction, it will not directly address the veracity of Prime Minister Singh’s assertion that “Naxalism is the single greatest internal security challenge ever faced” by his country. Given the plethora of insurgencies and violent communal movements still active in India, such an assessment would provide enough material for several lengthy theses. Instead, the central question posed here is whether the Naxalite movement currently represents a qualitatively different, and more dangerous, challenge to Indian political stability and development than it has in the past. As mentioned previously, the Naxalite insurgency is not a new phenomenon in India, and has been a thorn in the side of the country for over four decades. Generally speaking, its history can be broken down into three distinct periods, most easily distinguished by their level of insurgent activity and violence. The first period runs from the movement’s beginning in 1967 to its temporary suppression in 1972. This era encompassed the initial organization of the Naxalite movement and the rather rapid spread from its birthplace in West Bengal to a number of other states, notably Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. The second period, from 1972 until about 1991, was notable for the ideological and physical fragmentation of the movement, and its mostly localized activity in pockets of rural India. The third period (perhaps not coincidentally contemporaneous with India’s economic reforms) runs from 1991 to the present, and is distinguished by a process of gradual consolidation, culminating in the merger of the two most powerful insurgent groups (Maoist Communist Center and the 9 People’s War Group) in late 2004.25 The years since 2000 have witnessed the most dramatic escalation in the scope, breadth, and intensity of Naxalite violence. These three periods of activity will comprise the individual cases under investigation. To assess the nature and danger of the insurgency in each era, we will examine how variations in three independent variables (the socio-economic and political milieux, internal characteristics of the Naxalite movement, and governmental response) affected the dependent variable, the overall level of threat posed by the movement. These three cases will then be compared to determine whether or not the Naxalite movement indeed represents a greater danger to India than it has in the past, what specifically that danger is, and how it is likely to develop in the future. Finally, I will explore the implications for India’s continued rise and its prospects as a strategic partner of the United States. Primary and secondary source materials are utilized to the maximum extent practical. Primary sources consist largely of internal documents from the Government of India and Naxalite organizations, as well as quotes and speeches from government and insurgent leaders. As mentioned in the literature review, there is not as much rigorous academic source material on this issue as one might like. What peer-reviewed work there is receives primacy of place, but publications and studies from interested NGOs, think tanks, and security analysts also contain valuable information, and are included in this study. Finally, significant tertiary source material, in the form of coverage from reputable news media like The Economist, Frontline (an Indian weekly), and the Times of India, is required to fill factual gaps in the existing literature. E. TERMINOLOGY ISSUES For the purposes of this thesis, the generic term Maoist will refer to the Indian variety and be used interchangeably with Naxalite. Obviously, Maoist movements and organizations exist in many forms throughout the world and there are a number of others active in South Asia, most famously in Nepal. Other than a shared political ideology and 25 P.V. Ramana, “The Maoist Movement in India,” Defense and Security Analysis 22, no. 4 (December 2006): 435-449. 10 sympathy with each other’s causes, these groups remain separate and distinct entities, and care should be taken not confuse or conflate Naxalism with other Maoist movements more generally. When referring to Maoist organizations other than the Naxalites, the full name and country of origin are provided to avoid ambiguity. 11 II. THE ORGANIZATIONAL PERIOD (1967–1972) A. INTRODUCTION To inform an assessment of the relative threat posed by the current Naxalite insurgency, this chapter will undertake an historical analysis of the movement’s organization and initial activity in the period from 1967 to 1972. This era encompasses the birth of Naxalism and its fairly rapid rise as a force on the Indian political scene, and therefore presents a potentially illuminating parallel to the resurgence of violent Maoism in recent years. It also witnessed the movement’s initial failure, and so may contain useful lessons for countering the modern threat. To begin, a brief look at the history of Indian communism is in order. For the world’s largest democracy, India has a surprisingly long and complicated relationship with Marxist ideology. First emerging in 1920, in the fires of the Indian independence movement, it has grown into a major force on the sub-continent’s political scene. While all of its proponents adhere to the ultimate goal of building a utopian classless society, they have not always agreed on the most desirable method of achieving it. Nevertheless, whether motivating an underground subversive element or an aboveground, election-contesting political party, the basic ideology has proven remarkably resilient in the Indian context. Any examination of the birth of the Naxalite movement in the latter half of the 1960s requires an understanding of its development within this larger phenomenon. Jawaid Sohail, an Indian academic studying the origins of the Naxalites, divides the evolution of the Indian communist movement into six broad periods.26 From its birth until 1941, the Communist Party of India (CPI) suffered from poor organization and leadership. Outlawed by the British colonial authorities, it languished in relative obscurity. However, when Great Britain formed an alliance with the Soviet Union following the outbreak of World War II, the communists enjoyed a new legitimacy, 26 Jawaid, 4. 12 which they exploited by allying themselves with the popular Indian National Congress from 1941-1945. After World War II, this alliance foundered on the emerging international split between East and West, and the CPI moved into opposition against the growing power of Congress in New Delhi. Around the time of India’s independence in 1947, a struggle erupted between the peasants and their ruler in the princely state of Hyderabad, which was vacillating on accession to the Indian union. Inspired by the contemporaneous example of Mao’s “People’s Revolution” in China (and encouraged by its ideological benefactor, the Soviet Union), the CPI embarked on the fourth phase of its activity, supporting an armed agrarian uprising against feudal oppression in Hyderabad that became known as the Telangana movement. In 1948, when the Indian armed forces moved in to forcibly annex the Hyderabad principality, the Telangana insurgents turned against New Delhi. While this initial struggle achieved some degree of early success, temporarily “liberating” more than 3,000 villages and 16,000 square miles of territory, a confluence of events resulted in its ultimate demise. The strength of the Indian armed forces eventually proved overpowering, and a large number of the rebels were killed. Additionally, in an attempt to curry favor with India, the Soviet Union (which had encouraged the uprising in its earlier days) summarily withdrew its support. Taking the hint, the CPI dutifully followed suit in 1951.27 The failure of Telangana inaugurated the fifth period of communist activity, when the CPI, again at Soviet urging, sought to contest national and state elections in a bid to bring about the peaceful imposition of communist rule through democratic conduct. For many of the CPI’s more radical cadres, however, this decision was viewed as a betrayal of the Party’s revolutionary heritage. The memories of Telangana loomed large in their ideological imaginings and a sizeable faction of the CPI began to drift toward a more Maoist interpretation of Marxism-Leninism as the 1950s progressed.28 27 Ajay Mehra, “Naxalism in India: Revolution or Terror?” Terrorism and Political Violence 12, no. 2 (2000): 40-42. 28 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 20-22. 13 This rise of factionalism within the CPI defines the last of Sohail’s six phases and would reach its zenith in the 1960s. With the growing Sino-Soviet split from 1958-1964, the ideological tensions within the CPI continued to mount. These were only exacerbated by the emerging Sino-Indian border dispute in the early 1960s, in which the CPI leadership came down firmly on the side of New Delhi. The pro-Chinese leftists within the party branded this policy as revisionism of the worst sort, and attempted to wrest control from the pro-Soviet faction. Unable to muster sufficient support, they instead broke away from the CPI in 1964 to form the Communist Party of India-Marxist, or CPI- (M).29 However, the CPI-(M) was almost immediately beset by the same kind of ideological infighting that had precipitated its formation. The relatively more restrained group that formed the party’s leadership, though still hostile to the Soviet Union, grudgingly embraced electoral politics as a means of bringing about a more or less peaceful revolution in India. Consequently, when the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War broke out, it quickly condemned Pakistan and its Chinese patron in an effort to capitalize on the wave of nationalist sentiment sweeping India. This tactic proved remarkably successful, and CPI-(M) candidates enjoyed surprising success in the 1967 elections in West Bengal, firmly entrenching the new party within the Indian political process. This proved to be too much for the more radical Maoist faction, and it was within this contentious milieu that the Naxalite movement was born.30 There were now three major communist strands within India: the CPI, the CPI- (M), and the violently radical Maoists. This last group, eventually named for the birthplace of their armed struggle in Naxalbari, West Bengal, would in due course form a third, underground organization, the Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist, or CPI- (ML). Unlike its progenitors, the CPI-(ML) was totally opposed to the electoral process and espoused violent revolution as the only legitimate means of realizing its political agenda. In short, this entailed nothing less than the complete overthrow of the existing 29 Dipak K. Gupta, “The Naxalites and the Maoist Movement in India: Birth, Demise, and Reincarnation,” Democracy and Security 3, no. 2 (May 2007): 166. 30 Jawaid, 76-78. 14 political structure, corrupted as it was by the four evils of “U.S. imperialism, Soviet social-imperialism, feudalism, and comprador-bureaucrat capital.”31 From 1967-1972, this group embarked on a campaign of political terror that caused no small amount of consternation to national and state governments, and resonated, at least initially, with many poor residents of West Bengal, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh. To understand why, one must appreciate India’s broader political, economic, and social contexts during this period. B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments The first seventeen years of India’s independence were marked by the political hegemony of the Congress Party, personified in the undisputed leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru.32 Under his charismatic influence, the fissiparous tendencies of India’s many ethnic, linguistic, religious, and social groups were kept in check, and the country emerged as a surprising beacon of political stability in South Asia. His passing in 1964, however, (and the subsequent death of his successor, Lal Bahadur Shastri, after only two years in power) left the Congress Party rudderless, and the leadership that had united India’s various groups under the mantle of nationalism was gone. Over the next few years, the INC embarked on a process of infighting that diminished its iron grip on political power and allowed alternative forces of social mobilization to pose new challenges to its authority.33 From 1966-1972, this drama played out at the national level in the struggle between Indira Gandhi and Morarji Desai for the position of Prime Minister and head of 31 Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist),” May 1970, reprinted in Sankar Ghosh, The Naxalite Movement: A Maoist Experiment, (Calcutta: Firma K. L. Mukhopadhyay, 1974), 190-199. 32 For outstanding one volume histories of India, see: John Keay, India: A History (New York: Grove Press: 2000);0 Stanley Wolpert, A New History of India: 7th Edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004). 33 Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952-2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 80, 94-96. 15 Congress. While Mrs. Gandhi emerged at the head of a coalition of Congress factions, the structure proved too unwieldy to contest the 1967 national elections as effectively as it had in the past. Beset by a number of economic and social crises (discussed below), Congress suffered its worst electoral performance in history, winning only 40% of the popular vote and barely hanging on to majority in a parliament it had previously dominated.34 With its attention again focused inwardly, factional battles quickly resumed. Following another disappointing performance in the mid-term elections of 1969, the party officially split into two competing camps: Congress (O) under Morarji Desai, and Congress (R) under Indira {later Congress (I)}.35 Though she still commanded a plurality in parliament, Mrs. Gandhi now had to rely on a coalition of leftist parties to give her a working majority, a fact that complicated her ability to respond forcefully to the growing Naxalite movement. The decline in Congress hegemony at the center was mirrored by its performance in the state elections of 1967. From a position of complete dominance in nearly all the state legislatures, the party won only 1,661 of a total 3,453 contested seats.36 Moreover, for the first time, non-Congress led coalition governments came to power in a number of states. These included West Bengal and Orissa, both of which would shortly be affected by the growing Naxalite movement. Notably, the United Democratic Front (UDF) government that formed in West Bengal contained a large and influential bloc of CPI-(M) legislators, a fact that proved important on a number of counts. As previously mentioned, the party’s successful embrace of electoral politics served to further radicalize the already restive militant faction within the CPI-(M). Additionally, while the moderate members of the CPI-(M) and the Naxalites did become bitter enemies, as we shall see, the legacy of their earlier cooperation and shared ideology would greatly complicate the state government’s efforts to effectively counter their activities. The structural shifts underway on India’s political scene thus served to facilitate the emergence and spread of Naxalism in a number of ways. The temporary decline of 34 Wolpert, 382-383. 35 Ibid., 385. 36 Ibid., 383. 16 legitimacy at the center created greater instability that allowed alternative ideologies to take root, while the rise to power of a number of leftist parties (including the Communists) provided breathing room for their more extreme ideological brethren. Concurrently, the new requirements of coalition building diverted politicians’ attention from the essential task of ensuring security in their constituencies.37 To these must be added one more consideration: the fractious nature of political activity undoubtedly complicated the policymaking process at a time when the country faced a range of serious economic problems. While these did not necessarily arise as a result of the political turmoil, the ability of the system to effectively address them was certainly curtailed. 2. Economic Developments In spite of a series of Soviet-inspired Five Year Plans from 1951-1966, India remained a predominantly rural, agrarian economy. Burdened by generally inefficient and backward agricultural methods, it was extremely prone to underproduction and food shortages, a situation exacerbated by the country’s rapidly expanding population. The lack of proper irrigation and over-dependence on the seasonal monsoon rains caused widespread famine in 1952-53, and severe (if localized) food shortages in Bihar and West Bengal from 1965 to 1967.38 Perennially reliant on foreign food aid, particularly from the United States, Indira’s government was forced to seek even greater assistance from America in 1966, which she received in the form of increased wheat shipments and over $400 million U.S. for the implementation of India’s fourth Five-Year Plan.39 The focus of this plan was, in the words of Mrs. Gandhi, to “lay the foundation for a breakthrough in agriculture in the countryside,” primarily through state subsidization for a host of agrarian technology reforms that came to be known as the Green Revolution. Indeed, the combination of expanded irrigation networks, increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, and the utilization of higher-yielding crop varietals that had become available in 1965 did improve the food situation; by the early 1970s, India 37 Rabindra Ray, The Naxalites and their Ideology (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1988), 115. 38 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 212; Wolpert, 362, 380. 39 Wolpert, 380-381. 17 was self-sufficient in grain production for the first time in its history.40 Like most revolutions, however, this one took time to develop and produced a large amount of economic dislocation. Nowhere was this more evident than in West Bengal. These new technologies, while partly government sponsored, still required a fairly significant initial capital outlay to procure and utilize to their fullest advantage. Moreover, they tended to be best employed on relatively large tracts of land so cultivators could reap economies of scale in the new methods of production. As Edward Duyker points out in his study of the predominantly agrarian Santal tribe in West Bengal, this had the effect of economically favoring large landholders over smaller farmers, widening what were already significant income disparities between the two.41 In a system that had its roots in the Zamindars of the British colonial era, most of these smaller farmers were in fact sharecroppers, forced to give up as much as 50% of their harvest in rent to their jotedars, or landlords. To make matters worse, if smaller farmers were to avail themselves of the new technology at all, they often had to take out loans from village moneylenders at exorbitant rates of interest, usually only worsening their economic situation.42 What these long-suffering peasants were most in need of was a comprehensive system of land reform and rural development. Given the strongly socialist leanings of both Nehru and his daughter, the failure of the government to effectively tackle these problems previously was an indication of the power of entrenched vested interests. To be sure, a number of initiatives had been implemented, notably the Community Development and Rural Extension Program under the auspices of the Ford Foundation, the Panchayati Raj program, and a series of land reform laws in the 1950s and 60s.43 Unfortunately, a combination of corruption, cronyism, and loopholes in the legislation prevented any of these measures from having much of an impact on the landless laborers, 40 Keay, 524. 41 Edward Duyker, Tribal Guerrillas: The Santals of West Bengal and the Naxalite Movement (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1987), 55-57; Sumanta Banerjee, India’s Simmering Revolution: The Naxalite Uprising (London: Zed Books Ltd., 1984), 9-12. 42 Jawaid, 40-41; Gupta, 163. 43 Wolpert, 363-364. 18 tribals, and small farmers they were designed to help.44 On the contrary, larger landowners and jotedars were often able to twist the new regulations in their favor, worsening the plight of many of the rural poor, particularly in West Bengal. Nor were economic hardships confined to the countryside. Like most of India, Calcutta had been suffering from economic stagnation for a number of years, and when the Indian government was forced to devalue the rupee in 1966, it had financial repercussions that hit the city hard. The resulting inflation spawned an industrial recession in 1966-67, causing unemployment to increase to dangerous proportions, particularly among the educated youth. While precise figures for this period are unavailable, anecdotal evidence suggests that from one third to one half of all the unemployed were aged 16-24.45 With so much economic frustration in the cities and the countryside, it is not surprising that incidents of social unrest increased as well. 3. Social Developments Given the feudal socio-economic nature of much of its history, peasant uprisings in India were not uncommon. From 1783 to 1900 alone, at the height of the British Raj, over 100 such incidents affected the region to greater or lesser degrees, many of them in the perennially restive province of Bengal.46 As the Telangana uprising in the late 1940s showed, post-independence Indian society was no less susceptible to their occurrence. In retrospect, it appears obvious that many of the factors that had precipitated these events in the past were present in the latter half of the 1960s. As the living situation deteriorated for a substantial number of India’s peasants, strikes and food riots became increasingly frequent in the later 1960s.47 By 1967, many Bengali newspapers carried accounts of impoverished rural citizens driven to suicide by their dire economic straits.48 While the 44 Banerjee, 7-9. 45 Ibid., 32. 46 Mehra, 39. 47 Wolpert, 382. 48 Banerjee, 1. 19 authenticity of all these accounts is difficult to establish, they were emblematic of the desperation and discontent of a large segment of the Indian countryside. The situation in urban society was showing signs of similar strain. Disease, overcrowding, and a lack of adequate infrastructure had long been endemic to most of India’s major cities. Now, as a result of the chronic unemployment discussed in the previous section, increasing numbers of young people were also turning to petty criminality and other anti-social behavior. Known as the “lumpen-proletariat” in Marxist circles, the activities of these idle and angry youth served to further destabilize an already fragile social situation.49 Compounding this tendency was the wave of student radicalism sweeping the world in the latter 1960s. Anti-establishment rhetoric and leftist activism were common on university campuses throughout India, but especially prevalent in Calcutta. In 1965, the Communist faction captured the leadership of the student’s union at the prestigious Presidency College and embarked on a campaign of disobedience, strikes, and protests, many of them violent.50 As clashes between police and urban youths worsened over the ensuing years, Calcutta’s student population grew more radicalized. Watching these developments from their safe houses, the leaders of the Maoist faction in the CPI-(M) grew more confident by the day. The contradictions inherent in India’s “semi-feudal and semi-colonial” society, it seemed to them, were reaching their breaking point, and the situation was ripe for the masses to rise up and finally deliver India from its centuries of capitalist domination. To ignite this potent mixture of urban and rural unrest, all that was needed was a spark. 49 Banerjee, 33. 50 Ibid., 50-52. 20 C. INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NAXALITE INSURGENCY 1. Organization and Leadership Two men in particular laid the groundwork for Naxalism’s emergence in 1967. Kanu Sanyal, a long-time CPI-(M) organizer active among the Santal tribals in Darjeeling, was among those within the party who disagreed strongly with its newly conciliatory leanings toward New Delhi and electoral politics. He discovered an ideological mentor in a passionate but lesser known party functionary, Charu Mazumdar.51 Mazumdar, born to a high caste family in Darjeeling district in 1918, had joined the Communist movement as a young man while attending university, and remained active in the CPI and CPI-(M) for most of his adult life. By the mid-1960s, he had wholeheartedly embraced Maoism as the only valid form of Communist struggle for the Indian situation. Adhering to Mao’s dictum that “political power grows from the barrel of a gun,” Mazumdar utterly rejected electoral politics and sought to apply the lessons of the Chinese revolution, as he saw them, to the struggle in his own country.52 In this, he was greatly influenced by the writings of Lin Biao, the Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and his strategic formulations for guerrilla warfare.53 Mazumdar laid out his theories in a series of essays penned between 1965 and 1967 that served as something of a manifesto for his more radical comrades, particularly in West Bengal.54 In those two years, elements of the CPI-(M) started veering on a more overtly militant course. Under the guidance of Sanyal and Mazumdar, on March 3, 1967, an uprising of poor tribals and peasants erupted in the village of Naxalbari, in the Siliguri sub-division of Darjeeling. While initially confined to the seizure of land and food-grains hoarded by the jotedars, it soon turned violent and began spreading to other villages in Siliguri. By 51 Prakash Singh, The Naxalite Movement in India (New Delhi: Rupa & Co., 2006), 268-274. 52 Jawaid, 55. 53 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 126-127. 54 Biplab Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” Social Scientist 6, no. 12 (July 1978): 8- 10. 21 July 5, the movement had grown large enough to attract the attention of its ideological progenitor, the Communist Party of China (CPC), which, in an editorial in Beijing’s People’s Daily, lauded it as “a peal of spring thunder [that] has crashed over the land of India,” and “a development of tremendous significance for the Indian people’s revolutionary struggle.”55 In reality, the rebellion was not quite that momentous at this stage, as the ease with which it was put down by the West Bengal government would attest. In late July, increased police action and a near total lack of coordination within the movement began to take their toll, and the initial uprising disintegrated by September.56 Nevertheless, the fire had been lit. Mazumdar emerged as a revolutionary leader and his ideology attracted an increasing number of adherents. Now known as Naxalites, militant groups inspired by Mazumdar’s theories began appearing throughout India. Emboldened by China’s rhetorical support, Mazumdar and these like-minded radicals officially broke from the CPI-(M). In November 1967, the All India Coordination Committee of Revolutionaries (AICCR, later renamed the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries, AICCCR) was formed in an attempt to gather the various strands of Naxalism under the banner of one revolutionary party.57 Though largely successful, the deliberations in this body revealed a number of ideological differences among the groups that would prove extremely divisive in a few years. In two cases, that of the Andhra faction of the AICCCR led by Nagi Reddy and another group known as Dakshin Desh, the differences proved insurmountable at an early stage, resulting in their exclusion from the nascent organization. Nevertheless, in April 1969, the formation of the CPI-(ML), with Mazumdar at the head, was announced in Calcutta and quickly endorsed by the CPC.58 It had an estimated 17,000 members at its founding, the majority in Andhra 55 People’s Daily, “ Spring Thunder Breaks Over India,” July 5, 1967, reprinted in Prakash Singh, 259-264. While China did offer significant rhetorical support to the Naxalite movement early on, particularly through editorials in the People’s Daily and broadcasts on the government controlled Xinhua News Agency, there is little evidence of any more concrete assistance. . 56 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 12. 57 Ibid., 31. 58 Ibid., 33. 22 Pradesh and West Bengal.59 For the next three years, the CPI-(ML) would be the dominant face of Naxalism in India. With the pronouncement that the “Chinese Chairman is our Chairman, the Chinese path is our path,” Mazumdar’s agenda for the Naxalites was codified at the First Party Congress in May 1970. It explicitly called for a Maoist inspired violent overthrow of the Indian government by establishing liberated bases in the countryside, surrounding the cities, and eventually subsuming all of India within its “people’s democratic revolution.”60 While Mazumdar’s heady optimism may be understandable in the international political context of the late 1960s, the techniques he advocated for accomplishing these objectives were questionable, to say the least. 2. Strategy and Tactics Mazumdar’s strategy was predicated on the assumption that the contradiction between feudalism and the masses of India’s rural poor had reached the breaking point.61 In his estimation, the situation was ripe for a spontaneous uprising of the beleaguered peasants that would sweep the old political order from the scene in a few short years. In a 1968 article in Liberation, the Naxalites’ primary propaganda mouthpiece, Mazumdar opined that the People’s Liberation Army would be marching through the countryside “by the beginning of 1971, if not in 1970.”62 This outlook informed his strategic formulations in a number of ways. The first was an emphasis on the rural peasants as the true base of the revolution.63 The focus of revolutionary activity was squarely on the countryside, with urban agitation initially prohibited. However, with the majority of the rural population illiterate, Mazumdar was forced to rely on educated ideologues to form the ground level leadership of his organization. To this end, he encouraged the recruitment and 59 Rabindra Ray, 108. 60 “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist),” May 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 199; Jawaid, 36. 61 Ibid.,194. 62 Charu Mazumdar, writing in Liberation, Nov 1968, as reported in Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 62. 63 “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist,” May 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 194. 23 participation of educated urban youth, but demanded they leave the cities and adopt the ways of the local villagers to better indoctrinate and lead them in their revolutionary struggle.64 While a large number of radicalized college students (especially from Calcutta) heeded this call, their insinuation into rural society was highly problematic. Most were quite incapable of adapting to village life, and their different customs engendered suspicion from the more parochial tribals and farmers.65 As a result, while peasants were often capable of being motivated for local actions, they generally failed to adopt Naxalism’s broader ideology.66 As Dipak Gupta notes, the vast majority of activist cadres were educated and from upper caste Hindu families, with poor, illiterate peasants accounting for less than 20% of the committed membership.67 One reason for this apathy among the peasants may have been the Naxalites’ renunciation of mass movements, the second pillar of Mazumdar’s strategy. In his estimation, since the country was on the verge of a spontaneous revolution, it needed no organizing force to guide it. Indeed, mass organizations could only hurt the movement, as they would give the enemy a focus for retaliation.68 While the formation of the CPI- (ML) may seem to contradict this outlook, in reality, the party functioned more symbolically than as a classical political or military organization. While Mazumdar’s ideology did reign supreme, operational control was actually quite decentralized, with village and district level organizations enjoying almost complete autonomy. This situation utterly precluded the development of any sort of broader economic or social agenda that might have been useful in attracting greater peasant support. In fact, Mazumdar believed that attention devoted to social or economic programs could only detract from the primary goal of seizing political power from the state, and actively discouraged their formulation.69 64 Ghosh, 109. 65 Gupta, 173-174; Jawaid, 95. 66 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 57-59. 67 Gupta, 171. 68 Ghosh, 101. 69 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 58-59. 24 Rather than offering hope, Mazumdar contended that the way to inspire India’s poor was to offer the opportunity for revenge. This accounted for the third pillar of his overall strategy, which he dubbed the “annihilation of class enemies.”70 As the name suggests, this entailed the deliberately brutal murder of jotedars, moneylenders, and agents of the government in an effort to spread “red terror” throughout the countryside.71 With the injunction that “he who has not dipped his hand in the blood of class enemies can hardly be called a communist,” the implementation of this campaign became the primary goal of Naxalite cadres throughout India.72 While it did succeed in driving off the landowning elite in some of the affected areas, the sadistic nature of the killings eventually alienated many more of the peasants than it inspired.73 The tactics that Mazumdar prescribed for the execution of the annihilation strategy were similarly self-defeating. Believing that an obsession with the acquisition of firearms would only distract the peasants from their spontaneous revolutionary zeal, he initially forbade their use by any but the party’s leadership, and even these he limited to purposes of self-defense. In the application of the terror campaign, the cadres were only permitted to use traditional weapons like spears, sickles, and bows and arrows. His emphasis on decentralization also stressed the primacy of village level squads, usually of no more than seven members, at the expense of larger formations of fighters.74 Though he later paid lip service to the need for organizing a ‘People’s Liberation Army’ along more conventional lines, there was never any serious attempt to form such a force.75 These tactical decisions left the Naxalites at a decided disadvantage against the comparatively well armed and organized government security forces that eventually moved in to counter them. 70 Charu Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” Liberation, February 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 290-297. 71 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 45-46. 72 Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” reprinted in Ghosh, 294. 73 Dasgupta. The Naxalite Movement, 58, 64. 74 Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” reprinted in Ghosh, 291. 75 Banerjee, 204-206. 25 For all their operational errors, however, a temporarily accommodating political climate allowed the Naxalites to embark on a series of campaigns that caused no small amount of instability in the regions they affected. From the formation of the party in 1969 until July of 1971, they were a force to be reckoned with in a number of Indian states. 3. Naxalite Activity While Naxalite activity and violence in this period were reported from as far afield as Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, the Punjab, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, the bulk remained confined to West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.76 It was in these two states that the annihilation program was most effectively implemented and where the Naxalites had their greatest political impact. Perhaps surprisingly, the first large-scale campaign after Naxalbari came not in West Bengal, but in Srikakulum district of Andhra Pradesh. Srikakulum’s history of peasant unrest predated the Naxalites, emerging as early as 1961 in the form of agitation by the native Girijan tribals against the economic oppression of the landholding class. While this was usually relatively peaceful, the example and influence of Naxalbari soon turned it violent. By late 1968, under the leadership of a number of imported Naxalite cadres, the Girijans were becoming increasingly militant. In 1969, they embarked on a classic annihilation campaign for political control, killing more than 150 people and eventually extending their writ over more than 500 square miles. While Mazumdar’s hopes were high for this “liberated area,” the movement proved more fragile than it appeared. Coordinated action by the security forces resulted in the deaths or arrests of top Naxalite leaders in the district, and Girijan support for the insurgency dissipated by mid-1970.77 In late 1969, the Naxalites launched another offensive in the Midnapur district of West Bengal. Like Srikakulum, it was a classic annihilation campaign with exclusively 76 Singh, 45-81. 77 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 46-52. 26 political aims. In Midnapur, however, the leadership that instigated the rebellion was not composed of older party cadres, but young students from Calcutta.78 Led by Ashit Chatterjee and Santosh Rana, the movement achieved some early success, accounting for the deaths of around 100 ‘class enemies’ and considerable economic disruption. Like Srikakulum, however, the uprising proved unsustainable and collapsed in the face of pressure from the security forces in early 1970.79 Birbhum in West Bengal, Muzzafarpur in Bihar, and the Palia district of Uttar Pradesh also witnessed organized Naxalite activity in 1969-1970. Like all the other rural uprisings, however, their early intensity masked fundamental weaknesses, and they died out almost as dramatically as they had flared up.80 Ironically, Naxalism’s last major campaign in this period occurred not in the countryside, but in Calcutta. Perhaps in desperation at the failures of its rural campaigns, the CPI-(ML) made an abrupt strategic reversal and launched a “cultural revolution” in West Bengal’s teeming capital in April 1970.81 While some observers have described this surprising development as a spontaneous movement by the urban Naxalite cadres, it is clear that Mazumdar himself guided the emergence of this new front at an early stage. Initially, the focus of the movement was on the destruction of symbols of bourgeoisie culture. These included cinemas, universities, and statues of iconic Indian figures like Mahatma Gandhi. Within a few months, however, the annihilation campaign appeared in Calcutta. Initially targeting police officers, its focus soon shifted to CPI-(M) politicians and activists, and even middle-class businessmen.82 The fact that Naxalite violence had now arrived in a major city occasioned great alarm throughout the country, not least in New Delhi. As the insurgency grew more violent through 1970 and early 1971, however, it became apparent that it was losing its ideological focus. In large part, this was due to a dramatic shift in the makeup of the party’s membership. While upper class university 78 Ghosh, 78-79; Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 57. 79 Singh, 63. 80 Ibid., 64-74. 81 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 68-77. 82 Ibid., 79-91. 27 students had been an important component of the early Naxalite movement, by 1970, most had either been arrested or dropped out in revulsion at the excesses of the annihilation campaign. In their place, shiftless youth, petty criminals, and other anti\u0002social elements had risen to prominence in the urban faction of the CPI-(ML). Under the guise of class struggle, extortion, theft, and personally motivated murders by party cadres grew increasingly common. Unsurprisingly, this did little to endear the Naxalites to the majority of Calcutta society. Already alienated by the statue smashing campaign and other petty vandalism, the public turned decisively against them in 1971.83 As a result of this string of failures, the ideological cracks in the leadership of the CPI-(ML) that had been evident at its founding widened into chasms. Mazumdar was increasingly the target of pointed criticism from other Naxalite leaders on a number of issues.84 Prominent among these were his adoption of the annihilation strategy as the primary form of struggle, his total neglect of the urban proletariat as a target of agitation, and the wisdom of his prohibition of all mass organization - in short, all the tenets of his grand strategy. To make matters worse, he had also lost the rhetorical support of the CPC. In late 1970, the Chinese government sent a message to Mazumdar echoing many of the same criticisms that were emanating from within his own party.85 Shortly thereafter, its radio broadcasts in support of the CPI-(ML) ceased.86 Though still claiming allegiance to Beijing, Mazumdar diverged from the CPC line in 1971 by vocally supporting the uprising in East Pakistan against Yahya Khan’s government. This proved to be the last straw for many other Naxalite leaders, who finally broke ranks with this betrayal of China’s ideological direction.87 With the leadership hopelessly divided, the rural campaign in tatters, and the lumpen-proletariat dominating the urban scene, the 83 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 94-102. 84 Sohail, 45-49. 85 Ghosh, 12-21. 86 Banerjee, 170. 87 Banerjee, 247-248; Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 192-193. 28 Naxalite movement was foundering badly. Nevertheless, it would take concerted action by the central and state governments to definitively put an end to this era of Naxalite activity. D. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 1. Center Responses Initially, the government in New Delhi paid scant attention to the outbreak of violence in Naxalbari. Viewing the situation primarily as a localized law and order problem, it did little more than express its opinion to West Bengal that the situation should be dealt with swiftly.88 To be fair, in spite of the attention it received as a result of the CPC’s endorsement, the early movement was too weak and disorganized to merit much more of a reaction. Even as Naxalism organized and spread through 1968-69, it still failed to elicit much of an official response. As mentioned previously, this was probably due to the distraction provided by the leadership battles and other political machinations that occupied the center during these years. By 1970, however, the situation was beginning to change. The emergence of Naxalite violence in Calcutta, one of India’s largest cities, was too worrisome a development to ignore. On August 11, 1970, Indira Gandhi pronounced that the government would fight the Naxalites with “all the strength at its command.”89 Securing the elections in early 1971 provided a pretext for the deployment of military and paramilitary forces to some of the worst Naxal-affected districts.90 In July 1971, the center launched Operation Steeplechase, a coordinated campaign by the Indian army, the Central Reserve Police Force, and local police across contiguous districts in West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa that were still affected by Naxalite violence. This area encompassed West Bengal’s Midnapur and Birbhum districts, and the cadres still active were largely holdovers from those earlier campaign. While Steeplechase was not a complete success, 88 Ghosh, 37. 89 Singh, 112. 90 Ghosh, xxii. 29 in that a sizeable number of activists escaped the police dragnet, it did achieve some noteworthy results: hundreds of Naxalites were arrested, large caches of weapons were seized, and most importantly, the rural population’s confidence in the strength of the government was restored.91 New Delhi also attempted to undercut the grass-roots appeal of Naxalism by championing a number of rural development and land reform schemes.92 The West Bengal Land Reform Act, passed in January 1970, was one such initiative. It imposed ceilings on the total acreage individual families were allowed to hold and reduced the maximum rent that landlords could charge their sharecroppers. As usual, the law was filled with loopholes, and the ever-present corruption and conflicts of interest severely curtailed its overall efficacy.93 Nevertheless, it did help some of the landless poor and scored political points at the expense of the Naxalites. For all the efforts of the central government, however, Naxal violence remained fundamentally a state problem. India’s Constitution devolved authority over internal security to the states, and it was their policies and initiatives that mattered most.94 Of course, if a state proved incapable of handling its own affairs, there was a constitutional answer for that, too. 2. State Responses In Andhra Pradesh, a determined state government, united under firm Congress Party rule, was able to cope with the violence in Srikakulum on its own. While allegations of police brutality and ‘encounter killings’ were common, the swift and effective application of force by the state police broke the back of the insurgency there in a matter of months.95 The situation in West Bengal was somewhat more complicated. With the CPI-(M) occupying key leadership positions in the United Democratic Front 91 Singh, 99-100. 92 Wolpert 389; Jawaid, 98-100. 93 Jawaid, 86-89. 94 Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Annual Report 2006-07, 1. 95 Ghosh, 84. 30 government, West Bengal’s response to the emergence of Naxalism was initially quite tepid. This was largely due to infighting between the members of the coalition. While other parties argued for a strong response to the initial outbreak of violence in Naxalbari, the CPI-(M) vacillated. Though it wanted to reign in its adventurist cadres in Siliguri, it was fearful of damaging its revolutionary credentials by authorizing too forceful a response. Additionally, the agitators were still members of the CPI-(M) at this stage, and the party was hopeful of bringing them back into its fold. As a result, police actions in response to the increasing violence through July 1967 were quite circumscribed.96 By the time a deteriorating situation forced the government’s hand in August and September, the movement had already attracted a sizeable following. While the insurrection in Naxalbari was effectively put down in a relatively short period of time, the damage had been done. Though the inability of the UDF to effectively govern forced its dissolution in November 1967, mid-term elections returned it to power in February 1969. With broadly the same makeup, it proved even less capable of agreement in policymaking, particularly with respect to the Naxalites. Not only did the government fail to outlaw the movement, some of its constituent parties actually sought to curry favor with the Maoists in a bid to strengthen their popularity with rural voters.97 Again, this resulted in a generally weak security response, with the police budget actually reduced just as the activity in Midnapur and Calcutta was beginning to heat up.98 With the coalition hopelessly polarized and the security situation deteriorating, New Delhi imposed President’s Rule on West Bengal in March 1970. President’s Rule, an administrative device under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, allows the center to assume executive authority in a state if the ruling government can no longer form a majority in the state legislature.99 With the governor 96 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 9. 97 Jawaid, 96-97. 98 Ibid., 73. 99 Government of India, Constitution of India, Ministry of Laws and Justice, http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/welcome.html (accessed December 11, 2007). 31 (as an agent of New Delhi) now firmly in charge, the security situation began to improve rapidly. The 1932 Bengal Suppression of Terrorist Outrage Act was quickly revived, giving the police expanded powers of detention.100 Funding for the state police forces more than doubled, and the number of officers rose dramatically.101 Augmented by personnel from the center’s Border Security Force, these additional men were posted to hotbeds of Naxalite activity, especially Siliguri, Midnapur, and Calcutta. In April, a joint operation by the Indian military and the Central Reserve Police Force, in coordination with state police, successfully put down the Midnapur uprising in a matter of weeks.102 Though it took a while longer, the expanded presence in Calcutta also proved effective. Aided by government sponsored volunteer militias, ironically drawn from the same lumpen-proletariat element the Naxalites had utilized, forceful policing resulted in the deaths or arrest of thousands of Naxalite cadres and sympathizers.103 As in Andhra Pradesh, abuses by the anti-Naxal forces were not uncommon – in one notorious instance, 300 armed members of a volunteer militia rampaged through a Naxalite stronghold in the Cossipore-Baranagore neighborhood of Calcutta, killing nearly 100 suspected Naxalites in cold blood.104 Though brutal, the tactics were effective. By the end of 1971, Mazumdar was forced to officially abandon the urban campaign in the face of mounting losses.105 The movement was by this time a spent force, and its fortunes continued to decline as top leadership was caught up in the tightening police dragnet through the first half of 1972. Finally, on July 16, 1972, Charu Mazumdar himself was arrested from a safe house in the Calcutta suburb of Entally. On July 28, he died in police custody at the age of 54. The death of Mazumdar was a fittingly symbolic denouement to the movement that had burned so brightly for over five years. With the departure of its spiritual and ideological leader, the first phase of Naxalite activity in India was over. 100 Jawaid, 83-84. 101 Ibid., 85. 102 Gupta, 171. 103 Jawaid, 84. 104 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 92. 105 Banerjee, 213. 32 E. CONCLUSION This chapter has analyzed the birth, rise, and eventual decline of the Naxalite insurgency from 1967-1972. The emergence of Naxalism in 1967 was ultimately attributable to a number of factors. Persistent poverty and growing inequality in the countryside produced a groundswell of discontentment in the poor rural population. Deeply frustrated with their government, some peasants and tribals were willing to entertain any alternative ideology that promised empowerment and greater equity; though it was certainly the most violent, Naxalism was just one of a number of socio-political movements that began to emerge at this time.106 Concurrently, political instability brought by the initial weakening of the INC’s hegemony provided room for these alternative ideologies to grow. Finally, leftist revolutionary rhetoric was ubiquitous in the late 1960s, both domestically and internationally. This provided a veneer of ideological sophistication to a movement that offered little more than violence, and allowed it to challenge the state’s legitimacy, at least for a while. However, while the Naxalite movement during this period drew much attention from the press and occasioned a great deal of worry in New Delhi and elsewhere, it seems clear in hindsight that the danger was not as great as many feared at the time. Although Naxalism touched almost every part of the country from 1967-1972, its activities were widely dispersed, and it never controlled more than 200 of India’s 56,000 rural villages at any one time.107 As militant Communism blossomed throughout much of the third world in the late 1960s, it may seem surprising that it failed to gain more traction in the Indian context, beset as it was by many of the same socio-economic problems evident in Southeast Asia or Latin America. In the final analysis, much of the responsibility for the ultimate failure of the Naxalite movement in this period must be laid at the feet of Charu Mazumdar. 106 Some others included movements based on language, caste, and even the rural-urban divide. For a discussion of these phenomena, see: Yadav and Palshikar, 92-96. 107 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 62. 33 The man regarded as ‘India’s Mao Zedong\" proved to be a much less competent leader than his Chinese namesake. Ideologically, his blind application of the Chinese revolutionary model to India overlooked fundamental differences between the two countries. India’s governmental apparatus was much more powerful than its Chinese counterpart had been in the late 1940s. The institution of parliamentary democracy had become well entrenched in India, and it would take more than temporary economic hardships to undermine its widespread support. Additionally, despite its faltering in the elections of 1967, the Congress Party proved to be enduringly popular. The INC was granted an impressive mandate in the 1971 and 1972 elections at both the state and national levels, demonstrating that it retained the support of a majority of the Indian population.108 Therefore, while Mazumdar correctly identified the rising levels of discontent in Indian society, he totally misread the resultant potential for a rapid revolution. The majority of India’s peasants were concerned with local social and economic issues, and remained unmoved by Naxalite political ideology. As it turned out, most of Mazumdar’s strategic and operational initiatives actually proved counterproductive in winning over India’s masses. His single-minded focus on the seizure of political power and utter contempt for mass organization precluded the development of any socio-economic agenda that might have been useful in garnering broad rural support. While this was supposed to be achieved through the application of the annihilation campaign, the brutality of this program actually alienated the majority of peasants. When it was extended to urban areas during the Calcutta campaign, it had the same effect on most city residents; the ill-conceived “cultural revolution” and the excesses of the lumpen-proletariat faction only exacerbated this revulsion. In the end, Mazumdar’s strategic choices effectively denied his movement any base of popular support. Nor did he better acquit himself in his tactical formulations. The curious prohibition on firearms left his cadres woefully outgunned by the military and police. Additionally, his penchant for decentralization severely restricted the Naxalites’ ability to 108 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 229-231; Wolpert, 389. 34 adapt to changing military circumstances. Even as the scale of the government’s security operations grew from 1967-1972, the Maoists continued to emphasize small, village-level units at the expense of a more sizeable and coherent military organization. Time and again, these proved incapable of mounting an effective resistance to the larger, better equipped, and more highly organized forces arrayed against them. While Mazumdar’s inept leadership set the stage for the movement’s demise, the overall effectiveness of the government’s response must also be acknowledged. With the exception of the UDF initiatives in West Bengal, robust and forceful responses by state and central security forces were eventually successful in putting down all the uprisings. While these did involve a number of human rights abuses, the growing public disgust with Naxalite violence meant that most Indians seemed to accept these aggressive policing methods.109 Simultaneously, all levels of government increased funding for land reforms and rural development programs in an effort to address the socio-economic inequities that had helped spark the outbreak of violence. While these did not always work as they were intended, they did succeed in winning back the support of the rural poor. The final contributor to the failure of the Naxalite movement in this period was its overall organizational weakness. Mazumdar’s charismatic personality had papered over the movement’s fissiparous tendencies in 1967, but these forces could not be contained for long. Ideological differences and powerful egos erupted again in late 1970, and the leadership had irrevocably fractured by 1972. The CPI-(ML) splintered into a number of different factions, including the Maoist Communist Centre, the Proletarian Party, and a grouping of the CPI-(ML)’s Regional Committees of West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.110 Along with Dakshin Desh and the Nagi Reddy Group, these localized, weakened, and divided organizations would be the diminished face of Naxalism through its next period of activity, 1972-1991. 109 Gupta, 173 110 Jawaid, 94. 35 III. THE FRAGMENTARY PERIOD (1972-1991) A. INTRODUCTION In 1972, the Naxalites emerged from the failures and setbacks at the end of the Organizational Period in a critically weakened state: their founder and most influential leader, Charu Mazumdar, was dead; their surviving leadership was rotting in jail after a brutally effective government crackdown; their activists were disillusioned and demoralized after a succession of defeats; and the excesses of revolutionary zeal had alienated them from the vast majority of the Indian public. Given this litany of woes, most observers could be forgiven for assuming that the movement was as good as dead. As it turned out, the flame ignited at Naxalbari had not extinguished – it was, however, reduced to a smoldering ember that was very nearly snuffed out over the course of the next two decades.111 The years from 1972-1991 unquestionably marked the nadir of the Naxalite movement in India. Battered by the government’s security forces in the previous period, it desperately needed to reunify and consolidate its position. Instead, it was repeatedly fragmented by disagreements over ideological abstractions, strategic formulations, and even personal egos. The result was a proliferation of small, localized groups that proved utterly incapable of mounting any effective challenge to the Indian government. In short, the story of the Naxalites in this period is a rather boring one compared to the events of 1965-1972. It is, nonetheless, one worth examining. For the purposes of analyzing Naxalism’s resurgence after 1991, this period is important on three counts. First, it acted as a bridge between the two periods of relatively high Naxalite activity. Secondly, it gave rise to the factions that turned into the dominant Naxalite groups of the current era; clearly, any study of these organizations must take into account the circumstances of their birth. Lastly, determining the reasons for the movement’s inability to gain traction in the past should help in prescribing effective ways to counter its spread in future. 111 This analogy is borrowed, with appreciation, from Prakash Singh’s The Naxalite Movement in India. 36 B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments The 1970s and 80s were a transitional period in Indian politics. The instability of 1965-1971, discussed in the preceding chapter, was the first indication that the institution of one-party hegemony known as the ‘Congress System’ was not as unshakeable as it had previously appeared.112 Though Indira’s party enjoyed landslide victories at the state and national levels in 1971 and 1972, successfully consolidating the INC and the country under the banner of her leadership, this apparent return to the stability of the old ‘Congress system’ belied a number of emerging structural changes in the Indian polity. Chief among these were the increasing politicization of lower and middle classes and castes, the rising importance of local-level issues, and the resultant emergence of regional and state level parties. While these processes evolved gradually, they set the stage for the tremendous changes that would occur on the Indian political scene in the 1990s, and helped make politics in these two decades more complex than it had been in the past. Though a thorough examination of these phenomena is outside the scope of this thesis, they indirectly impacted the course of Naxalism in a number of ways.113 One was through political developments in New Delhi. As previously alluded, Congress (I) emerged in 1972 with firm control of the national government. In light of the changing political scene, the party was remarkably effective in maintaining its grip on power for the remainder of this period, only relinquishing it during two brief interludes of Janata Party-led coalition government, in 1977-1980 and 1989-1991. In retrospect, this success was largely due to Indira’s political guile and capacity for heavy-handed authoritarianism. Recognizing that anti-colonial nationalism was no longer an effective rallying cry for the masses, she sought to mobilize support by turning to a more populist 112 Rajni Kothari, “The Congress ‘System’ in India,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 58-70. 113 For an excellent examination of structural changes in Indian politics during this period, see: Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952- 2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 73-113. 37 message.114 Though Congress remained the party of India’s industrial classes, it also began to reemphasize its socialist roots. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, agricultural development, poverty reduction, and economic self-sufficiency featured prominently in Congress’ platform, successfully attracting significant portions of the lower classes and castes.115 This shift in message did more than win elections – it also boosted the government’s legitimacy with India’s poor, thereby undercutting the appeal of alternative ideologies like Naxalism. When rhetoric proved insufficient in maintaining Congress hegemony, however, the party was not averse to taking more extreme measures. The imposition of the ‘Emergency’ from June 1975 to March 1977 demonstrated this most strikingly. Faced with declining popularity and a series of legal challenges to her rule, Mrs. Gandhi temporarily abrogated the constitution, suspended all civil rights, jailed opposition political figures, and instituted martial law throughout the country.116 Though democracy and the rule of law were reinstated with the national elections in 1977, Indira, and the Congress Party more generally, showed themselves more than willing to deal harshly with political opposition. As we will see, this resulted in a usually muscular response to separatist movements and other insurrections, including those of the Naxalite groups. Developments at the state level were also important. Throughout the early 1970s and the period of the Emergency, Congress governments retained power in the vast majority of the Indian states. However, after the INC’s temporary defeat at the center in 1977, the number and influence of state-level parties accelerated dramatically. Significantly, this phenomenon began in those areas most affected by Naxalism during the previous period, with the emergence of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh and the resurgence of the CPI-(M) in West Bengal.117 The growth of these parties, many of which depended on tenant farmers and landless laborers for their 114 Yadav and Palshikar, 96. 115 Wolpert, 389-410. 116 Ibid., 398-399. 117 Yadav and Palshikar, 106-112. 38 primary constituencies, gave a new political voice to groups that had been effectively disenfranchised in the past. Their inclusion in the political process helped keep rural unrest in check and brought an added impetus for meaningful action on economic issues that were dear to this large demographic. 2. Economic Developments India’s economy during this period was something of a mixed bag. At the macro level, Congress’ socialist policies, the persistence of an overbearing public sector epitomized by the ‘License Raj’ and a strategy of import-substitution industrialization introduced significant distortions in the economy that stifled growth the country so desperately needed. While overall GDP increased at an average of 3.5 percent throughout the 1970s, an exploding population meant the corresponding rate per capita was only 1.3 percent, far below that of the rest of the developing world. Though tepid attempts at liberalization resulted in slightly higher growth rates in the 1980s, their incomplete nature resulted in a balance of payments crisis that ultimately proved unsustainable and precipitated the economic reforms of the 1990s.118 On the other hand, the benefits of the Green Revolution were finally becoming more evenly distributed, and Congress’ newfound political populism translated into a slew of rural and agricultural development initiatives and aid programs.119 For the country’s poor farmers at least, the picture was finally becoming a bit brighter. Indira’s initial reforms after the 1971 elections were ambitious in scope and included land-reform legislation, rural employment programs, nationalization of food markets, and investment in transportation infrastructure designed to help farmers get their product to market. These were consolidated in the country’s Fifth Five Year Plan, launched in 1974, the explicit aims of which were the “removal of poverty” and the “attainment of economic self-reliance.” For all its optimism, the plan’s designs were complicated by the same corruption and conflicts of interest that had plagued reform efforts in previous eras. Additionally, the worldwide oil shocks of the early 1970s 118 Gurcharan Das, “The India Model,” Foreign Affairs 85, no. 4 (July/August 2006): 4-5. 119 Wolpert, 387-388; Jawaid, 100-102. 39 brought massive inflation that substantially diminished economic growth in real terms. Bihar and Gujarat erupted in riots and protests at the diminishing economic situation, and a national railroad strike threatened to bring the country to a standstill and compound its economic problems.120 Though political factors contributed more directly to the imposition of the Emergency in 1975, Indira used her newfound power to tackle the economic challenges facing the country. Her ‘Twenty-Point Program’ of economic development was very similar to the country’s Fifth Five Year Plan, but with political opposition sidelined, Mrs. Gandhi was able to force its implementation more effectively.121 For all its authoritarianism, the Program was remarkably successful in getting the economic situation under control and finally bringing some relief to farmers and the rural poor. Inflation was successfully tamed, food prices retreated to their 1971 levels, and agricultural investment and subsidies began reaching the people that truly needed them.122 When the Emergency was repealed and the Janata government came to power in 1977, the coalition proved so weak and the government so ineffectual that economic problems returned almost immediately. Inflation and unemployment skyrocketed, and Congress returned to power in 1980 with the slogan “Elect a Government that Works!”123 Though she initially tried to cut agricultural subsidies, the political backlash convinced Indira and her party that the rural interests would still have to be placated. The Sixth Five Year Plan brought numerous anti-poverty initiatives like the Integrated Rural Development Program and the National Rural Employment Program, and inaugurated huge agricultural subsidies that continued throughout the 1980s.124 In sum, while overall economic performance throughout this period was relatively mediocre, the numerous development initiatives meant the plight of the rural poor ceased to deteriorate as it had 120 Wolpert, 396-397. 121 Ibid., 400. 122 Ibid., 403. 123 Ibid., 407-410. 124 Banerjee, 293. 40 from 1965-1972. In fact, the rural poverty rate declined relatively dramatically over this period, from 56% in 1973 to only 39% by 1988.125 This is not to imply that these programs were unqualified successes; corruption and conflicts of interest continued to hamper their implementation, and their benefits were far from uniformly distributed. Nevertheless, they were successful enough to alleviate some of the income disparities that had stoked the fires of Naxalism in the previous period, and diminished economic and class issues as a source of social unrest.126 3. Social Developments Despite the attenuation of economic inequity as a source of social strife, the 1970s and ‘80s witnessed the birth of new ethnic and religious cleavages in India’s heterogeneous society, precipitating the rise of a number of new communal and secessionist movements. Though none of these were directly connected to the phenomenon of Naxalism, their emergence and the government’s response did have implications for the Maoists’ fortunes. Two of the most prominent of these movements occurred in the Punjab and India’s wild Northeast. In the late 1970s, a wave of unrest swept India’s ‘Seven Sisters,’ the small and predominantly tribal states east of the Siliguri corridor. While the trouble started in response to an influx of Bengali refugees in the wake of the 1971 Indo-Pak War, it soon took on a distinctly separatist character.127 Historically, the region had only the loosest association with the rest of the subcontinent and was much more culturally bound to neighboring areas of Burma than to the rest of India. By the early 1980s, the Assamese, Bodo, Naga, and Mizo peoples had launched a series of violent secessionist movements, many of which continue to the present day. In response, New Delhi imposed martial law and dispatched the military and central police forces to put down the rebellions.

The Sikh community had agitated for a separate Sikh nation, notionally known as Khalistan, since around the time of Partition and Independence in 1947. The movement had been largely peaceful in the intervening decades, but by the late 1970s, it was becoming more belligerent. Under the leadership of J. S. Bhindranwale, a Sikh religious guru, armed members of the separatist Akali Dal Party stormed the Golden Temple at Amritsar in a direct challenge to New Delhi’s authority. In response to the rising violence and lawlessness throughout the Punjab, Indira’s actions were swift and uncompromising. In June of 1984, the Indian Army launched ‘Operation Bluestar,’ retaking the Golden Temple by force and inflicting massive casualties on its Sikh defenders.129 The operation cost Mrs. Gandhi her life (she was shortly thereafter assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards) and did not end the Khalistan movement immediately. It did, however, set the tone for the center’s response through the remainder of the decade.130 Extremely aggressive security actions continued, and ultimately proved successful in putting down the insurrection by the early 1990s. For the Naxalites, the impact of unrest in the Punjab and the Northeast was twofold. First, it seems likely that the threats to the integrity of the nation served to rally significant portions of the electorate to the government, giving New Delhi an added source of legitimacy. Much as the government enjoyed a boost of popularity in 1971-72 during the Indo-Pak war, the actions against the animist tribals and (especially) the Sikhs played well with India’s majority Hindu polity.131 This doubtlessly helped curtail the popularity of an anti-government ideology like Naxalism. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the aggressive response to each of these movements presented a daunting 128 Wolpert, 425-426. 129 Ibid., 416-418. 130 Ibid., 423-425. 131 Ibid., 418. 42 challenge to any other would-be troublemakers. As historian Stanley Wolpert notes, “The stunning, shocking violence of Operation Bluestar served to put every minority in India on immediate notice of just how dangerous continued opposition to Delhi could be.”132 The Naxalites could certainly be included as one of these minority groups. As we shall see, however, the most potent enemy of Naxalism in this period was the internal disarray of the movement itself. C. INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NAXALITE INSURGENCY 1. Organization and Leadership Following the death of Charu Mazumdar in 1972, the Naxalites underwent a process of fragmentation that severely crippled the movement over the ensuing decades. Though their total numbers stayed relatively steady, with most estimates in the neighborhood of 15,000 activists nationwide, the leadership was increasingly driven by ideological and operational differences of opinion.133 While the failures of the previous period were the immediate catalyst for this phenomenon, the movement had displayed factionalist tendencies almost from its inception. At the organizational meetings of the AICCCR in 1969, two groups parted ways with the nascent CPI-(ML) from the outset. The first of these was the Andhra faction of Naxalites under the leadership of Nagi Reddy. Reddy differed with Mazumdar’s formulations on a number of points, most crucially the blanket ban on elections and the single-minded emphasis on the annihilation strategy at the expense of economic struggles and mass organization.134 After being disaffiliated from the AICCCR, Reddy formed his own organization in 1969, the Andhra Pradesh Revolutionary Communist Committee (APRCC). While the APRCC was initially larger than the CPI-(ML), Reddy’s arrest in late 1969 severely curtailed its activities.135 In the 1970s, the APRCC broke up into a 132 Wolpert, 418. 133 New York Times, “Maoist Extremists Reappear in India,” October 12, 1980. 134 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 154-156. 135 Ibid., 34. 43 number of smaller organizations, the two most significant of which were the Unity Center of Communist Revolutionaries of India (UCCRI) led by Nagi Reddy himself and Chandra Pulla Reddy’s Revolutionary Communist Center (RCC).136 While both groups were marginally active in Andhra Pradesh through the 1970s, they underwent numerous splits themselves in the latter half of the decade. By 1990, these smaller groups had either withered to inconsequence or been absorbed by other Naxalite outfits. The other faction that split from the AICCCR in 1969 was known as Dakshin Desh. Its leaders, Amulya Sen and Kanai Chatterjee, also disagreed with Mazumdar over the necessity of mass organization and established their own group, initially based in West Bengal. With the government crackdowns of 1970-71, Dakshin Desh moved its operations to Bihar, changing its name to the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) in 1975.137 Though relatively small, the MCC remained a more or less coherent organization over the course of these two decades. The same could certainly not be said for Charu Mazumdar’s CPI-(ML). The party had always been a relatively fragile construct of disparate personalities and ideologies, but after the setbacks of 1971-1972, it underwent a dizzying process of fractionalization that resulted in the emergence of literally dozens of competing groups. As the smaller organizations were often short-lived and of little real significance in the future development of the movement, only the most important will be enumerated here. Following Mazumdar’s death in 1972, the CPI-(ML) split into two broad camps: those who supported his ideology, strategy, and tactics, and those who opposed them. The pro-Mazumdar camp was further divided in 1973, with Lin Biao’s fall from grace in the Chinese Communist Party. A source of great inspiration for Mazumdar’s ideology, his disavowal by the Chinese generated contentious ideological debate within this branch of Naxalism.138 The pro-Mazumdar/pro-Lin Biao faction, a distinct minority, regrouped in West Bengal under the leadership of Mahadev Mukherjee.139 The pro-Mazumdar/anti- 136 Banerjee, 166, 298. 137 Prakash Singh, 115-116. 138 Banerjee, 246. 139 Ghosh, 175-177. 44 Lin Biao faction emerged in Bihar as CPI-(ML) Liberation, and in Andhra Pradesh as the Central Organizing Committee CPI-(ML), or COC-(ML).140 The COC-(ML) would itself split in 1977, with one faction, led by Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, reestablishing itself in 1980 as CPI-(ML) People’s War Group, or PWG, in Andhra Pradesh.141 Among the anti-Mazumdar camp, the shakeout in this period was somewhat less confusing. The largest group emerged under the leadership of Satyanarayan Singh, the erstwhile Secretary of the CPI-(ML)’s Bihar State Committee. Singh had fallen out with Mazumdar in late 1971 over the latter’s authoritarian tendencies and seemingly suicidal tactical injunctions. In November of that year, Singh and a number of similarly disenchanted leaders formed a parallel leadership and actually expelled Mazumdar from his own party.142 Though most of the Naxalite rank-and-file did not initially accept this, Singh attracted a sizeable following after Mazumdar’s passing. His organization, known as CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh, was the largest and most influential of the post-Mazumdar Naxalite groups in the 1970s.143 The only other sizeable anti-Mazumdar group to emerge was Bihar’s CPI-(ML) Unity Committee, led by Khokan Mazumdar (no relation to Charu). In 1982, this group merged with the Bihar faction of the COC-(ML) to form the CPI-(ML) Party Unity, with Naveen Prasad as its new leader.144 While the proliferation of groups in this period might give an impression of vitality, the splintering of the movement was actually indicative of a great deal of uncertainty and acrimony in the ranks. While all still agreed on the need for a Maoist\u0002inspired political revolution in the country, Mazumdar’s death and the fallout from the failures of the 1965-1972 period had left the Naxalites confused and quarrelsome, on issues both practical and ideological. Cries of ‘revisionism’ by one group were answered with counteraccusations of ‘left-adventurism’ from another. The resultant infighting left 140 Prakash Singh, 156; Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 22. 141 Prakash Singh, 130. 142 Ghosh, 139-144, 151. 143 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 10. 144 Prakash Singh, 159-160. 45 the cadres demoralized and the leadership even more hopelessly divided.145 Perhaps no issue generated more contention than the most appropriate strategy to pursue in the post\u0002Mazumdar era. 2. Strategy and Tactics Following the security crackdowns in 1971-72, most of the Naxalite groups initially continued to advocate a violent strategy. With the memories of government repression fresh in their minds, this was not altogether surprising – most of their leaders continued to languish in prison, often under harsh conditions. Dakshin Desh and the pro\u0002Lin Biao faction in West Bengal were particularly vociferous in their agitation for a continuation of the annihilation policy. The other groups placed more rhetorical emphasis on building up mass organizations, but they too were initially unwilling to forswear armed struggle against the hated oppressors.146 However, with the end of the Emergency and the rise of the first Janata government, a more moderate position began to emerge within a key segment of the Naxalite movement. The CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh was the first major organization to change tack. Negotiating with Janata politicians from his jail cell after the 1977 elections, Singh’s aversion to electoral politics and compromise with the state softened. In a surprise move, he released a press statement in April 1977 expressing his “critical support” for the new Janata government and vowing that his group would participate in the assembly elections of June of that year.147 The formerly staunch advocate of the annihilation strategy went so far as to announce, “We wish to state categorically here that violence is not our ideology. Our ideology is Marxism-Leninism.”148 Though he justified this ideological reversal on the grounds that it would secure the release of political prisoners and enable the Maoists to present their platform to more of the population than ever before, his move 145 Jawaid, 94-95. 146 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 11. 147 Ibid., 14. 148 Prakash Singh, 121-122. 46 was viewed as treason by the rest of the movement.149 However, when the Janata government delivered on its promises of clemency and one of Singh’s candidates was actually elected in West Bengal (Santosh Rana, formerly the leader of the Midnapur uprising), his approach was vindicated in the eyes of many Naxalites. Even such old\u0002school stalwarts as Kanu Sanyal and Ashim Chatterjee eventually gave Singh’s strategy their grudging endorsement.150 Throughout the rest of the 1970s and 80s, CPI-(ML) Liberation and various lesser organizations followed the CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh’s lead and slowly moderated their stance. To be sure, it took time for the incidences of violence to diminish, and many of these groups stressed that they still retained the option of armed revolution.151 Nevertheless, they increasingly normalized their activities, allying themselves with leftist political parties and contesting elections at the state level through front organizations in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal.152 For other groups, however, rapprochement with any government forces, whatever their political stripes, remained anathema. The MCC, COC-(ML), and CPI-(ML) Unity Committee acknowledged the need for a greater emphasis on mass organization, but only in support of armed agrarian revolution.153 The latter two organizations splintered in the late 1970s, but their descendants carried on their two-pronged strategy of mass mobilization and violent opposition in the subsequent decade. Both the PWG and Party Unity continued the killing of jotedars and other class enemies, but not as single-mindedly as the CPI-(ML) had in the past. They also established aboveground organizations to agitate for land reform and minimum wages, and began setting up parallel administrations to dispense justice and other government functions that were lacking in the remote areas where they operated.154 Interestingly, the PWG was also able to attract some support by waging a 149 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 14-15. 150 Prakash Singh, 123. 151 Ibid., 158. 152 Tilak, 19-20; Prakash Singh, 123. 153 Prakash Singh, 123. 154 Ibid., 133-134. 47 campaign against social vice in the villages, which included crusades against drunkenness, gambling, and prostitution.155 Despite their avowed commitment to a similarly multi-pronged approach, the MCC was generally less successful in these secondary endeavors. During the 1980s, the group was best known for the gruesome nature of its continuing annihilations, still directed primarily at upper caste landlords.156 At the tactical level, those groups espousing violence began implementing more realistic methods in their continued pursuit of armed revolution. Discarding the Charuist aversion to modern weaponry, most actively encouraged the capture of guns from jotedars and police.157 While this slowly improved the Naxalites’ firepower, their operations remained dominated by small squad-level actions, and were generally unsophisticated in terms of their planning and execution. In the late 1980s, the PWG did receive some training from LTTE rebels in more advanced tactics, including the use of explosives. This enabled them to successfully carry out a land-mine attack against police forces in 1989, providing a deadly portent of things to come.158 For the most part, however, major improvements in the Maoists’ operational capabilities would not come until well into the next decade. 3. Naxalite Activity As fundamental as it was, the split between those groups that followed the Singh line of political normalization and those that continued with the strategy of violence was just one of a host of divisions that spread like a cancer through the movement. Even groups on the same side of the strategic divide remained pitted against one another over issues of personality or ideology, and fratricide was not uncommon.159 In this contentious environment, there was little hope of consolidation or cooperation. Split as 155 Prakash Singh, 137-138. 156 Ibid., 151-153. 157 Ibid., 136 , 151. 158 Ibid., 140-141. 159 Ibid., 155. 48 they were into numerous smaller groupings, the Naxalites’ activity in this period was generally circumscribed and remained restricted to a few small geographic areas. Throughout the early and mid-1970s, a combination of effective security efforts and the imprisonment of most of the leadership put a stop to almost all violent Naxalite activity. Indeed, brief periods of unrest were recorded in only two places: northern West Bengal and Bhojpur district in Bihar. The agitation in West Bengal erupted in 1973, led by the pro-Mazumdar/pro-Lin Biao faction of Mahadev Mukherjee. For about a year, actions against police forces resulted in several dozen deaths and the seizure of a similar number of firearms, but the uprising fizzled with Mukherjee’s arrest towards the end of 1974.160 The activity in Bhojpur was slightly longer lived, lasting from 1972-1977, and was led by CPI-(ML) Liberation. Still committed to violent revolution at this stage, the group carried out a number of annihilations against class enemies with the support of local tribes. Still, the uprising was a small-scale affair, accounting for only around ninety deaths over the entire five-year period, with its longevity due more to the state government’s anemic response than the actual strength of the insurgency. Like its counterpart in West Bengal, it was put down relatively easily with the introduction of more aggressive security measures, this time from the center.161 The late 1970s witnessed the dramatic announcements of Satyanarayan Singh and the political normalization of a number of Naxalite groups. Though gradual, this proved to be an enduring phenomenon, and the CPI-(ML) S.N.Singh and its followers largely retreated from violent activities. Though still active politically, their strategic course change effectively removed them from the Naxalite fold by the early 1980s, at least for the purposes of this thesis. As for the more recalcitrant Maoists, two dozen smaller groups remained minimally active in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and a number of southern states.162 Between them all, however, they accounted for only a handful of incidents and even fewer deaths. Throughout the 1980s, the only groups of 160 Ghosh, 175-177. 161 Prakash Singh, 117-119. 162 Ibid., 124. 49 any real significance were the PWG in Andhra Pradesh, and what the Indian security official Prakash Singh dubbed the ‘New Left’ in Bihar.163 Formed in April 1980 by Kandapalli Seetharamaiah, the PWG quickly became the most powerful Naxalite organization in the country. Though this latter fact was admittedly not much of a boast during this period, they were a disruptive influence in their primary area of operations, the perennially restive and underdeveloped Telangana region.164 While the group did engage in rudimentary social projects and set up a number of peasant organizations to help mobilize the masses in pursuit of economic goals, Seetharamaiah was also a firm believer in Mazumdar’s annihilation strategy. As Table 1 shows, the group grew increasingly violent under his leadership, with attacks on jotedars, police, and police informants.165 Though still relatively contained by the end of the 1980s, the PWG was already demonstrating the bloody ruthlessness that would distinguish it in later decades. The ‘New Left’ in Bihar emerged at roughly the same time as the PWG. Comprised of the MCC, Party Unity, and CPI-(ML) Liberation, the title may give a misleading impression of cooperation amongst the groups. In reality, they fought each other nearly as often as they engaged ‘class enemies,’ often in petty squabbles over turf or ideological nuances. 163 Prakash Singh, 124. 164 Ibid., 129-141. 165 Ibid., 140 YEAR INCIDENTS KILLED 1981 53 10 1982 98 18 1983 172 17 1984 306 30 1985 308 30 1986 161 25 1987 252 63 1988 453 59 1989 456 84 1990 735 94 Table 1. Naxalite Violence in Andhra Pradesh 50 Nevertheless, they too managed to make an impact at the state level. Like Telangana, Bihar remained beyond the reach of many of the government’s reform initiatives, and pockets of rural unrest continued to provide havens for Naxalite cadres.166 Though Liberation was the largest of the three groups, its gradual embrace of electoral politics over the course of the decade made it the least violently active. It maintained an armed wing into the 1990s, but its aboveground political organization, the Indian People’s Front, increasingly supplanted the influence of its more belligerent cadres.167 The faction favoring normalization gained dominance in 1992, and Liberation thereafter functioned primarily as an aboveground outfit, focused almost exclusively on peaceful mass organization.168 In a telling signal of the extent of their moderation, its leaders even called for rapprochement with the formerly despised CPI and CPI-(M), in an effort to build a more coordinated leftist political front.169 By contrast, the MCC and Party Unity remained exclusively committed to armed revolution. Mass organization was desirable, but in the context of a burgeoning caste conflict in the state during this period, often difficult to mobilize along exclusively class lines. Instead, the annihilation strategy was pursued with a decidedly grisly purpose, particularly by the MCC. In most cases, upper caste jotedars and their families were the primary targets but, with the conflation of caste and class conflicts in the state, the sadistic nature of the killings failed to generate the same backlash that had occurred previously. As a result, both the MCC and Party Unity were able to carve out small areas of influence in Bihar over the latter half of the 1980s.170 As in Andhra Pradesh, however, this level of activity remained a far cry from that of 1967-1972. 166 Prakash Singh, 148-160. 167 Tilak, 19. 168 Prakash Singh, 158. 169 Tilak, 20. 170 Prakash Singh, 148-156, 159-160. 51 D. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 1. Center Responses From the halls of power in New Delhi, Naxalism appeared to be a spent force after 1972. With the center caught up in the drama of systemic political change and the growth of ethnic secessionist movements over these two decades, relatively scant attention was paid to the fractured and localized Maoist movement in the country. Nevertheless, as alluded in Section 3.2, developments at the national level did have an impact on the Naxalites. With the INC’s turn to a more populist platform, new rural development and land reform initiatives effectively undercut the movement’s base of support. With rural inequality receding rather than growing, the more militant cadres had a much harder time finding sympathetic base areas from which to operate. Even for those sections of the movement that drifted in a more moderate direction, the government’s schemes were successful in stealing their rhetorical thunder and foiling most attempts at mass organization; Naxalite candidates did not generally have much success at the polls, Santosh Rana’s success notwithstanding.171 While these developments posed indirect problems for the Naxalites, a much more immediate challenge emerged with the imposition of the Emergency in 1975. Though not primarily directed at the Naxalites, the resultant political and security crackdowns hit the movement hard. Like most other opposition groups, all Naxalite organizations were banned and scores of leaders and party activists rearrested under the newly instituted Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA).172 Among them were some of the Maoists’ most effective organizers, including Kanu Sanyal, Ashim Chatterjee, and Satyanarayan Singh. Moreover, the security forces were given wide latitude in dealing with whatever opposition escaped the prison cell. Frequently, this entailed direct action like that of ‘Operation Thunder,’ which crushed the long-simmering 171 Prakash Singh, 211-212. 172 Banerjee, 297. 52 unrest in Bhojpur with combined operations by the military and Central Reserve Police forces in 1977.173 Already in tatters after Mazumdar’s death, the Naxalite movement was nearly destroyed by the center’s expanded powers during the Emergency.174 Ironically, it was also New Delhi that granted it a new lease on life. The Janata government’s promises to undo the excesses of the Emergency resulted in the release of hundreds of Naxalite prisoners all across the country in 1977 and 1978, the legalization of most of their organizations, and the easing of pressure by government security forces.175 While this ultimately had the effect of moderating several factions and co\u0002opting them into the political process, it also freed the more hard-core cadres to resume their subversive activities. Though the INC returned to power in New Delhi in 1980, it did not resume its previous activities against the Naxalites. In part, this was due to the still extremely weak state of the movement. More importantly, however, the government already had its hands full with the growing unrest in Punjab and the Northeast. Nevertheless, the center’s security initiatives with respect to these other regions reverberated among the Naxalites. The extremely aggressive response to these insurgencies likely helped convince the more moderate Maoists that the path of armed rebellion was untenable and provided some deterrent effect even to their more violent-minded brethren. Whatever the case, Naxalite violence remained at a sufficiently low ebb through the 1980s to permit the central government to largely dismiss it as a local law and order problem. The same could not necessarily be said for those states that were more directly affected. 2. State Responses As the birthplace of Naxalism, West Bengal had the longest history in dealing with the insurgency. While effective policing put down the 1973-74 uprising of Mahadev Mukherjee’s faction, rural unrest continued to simmer under a series of Congress administrations. When a Left Front coalition government returned to power in 1977, 173 Prakash Singh, 119. 174 Mehra, 51-52. 175 Prakash Singh, 122; Tilak, 12. 53 however, the situation changed dramatically. Led by the CPI-(M), the new administration proved much more competent and enduring than its predecessors. Under its direction, West Bengal instituted a series of land redistribution and rural development initiatives that proved remarkably successful. One of these was ‘Operation Barga,’ which established strict ceilings on total landholdings by individuals and granted inheritable ownership rights to tenant farmers and sharecroppers.176 Unencumbered by the political compromises, conflicts of interest, and enforcement issues that so often plagued center\u0002led efforts, these state-level reforms removed the Maoists’ raison d’etre in a few short years. By the early 1980s, Naxalism had ceased to be a force of any consequence in the state.177 Though not as successful as West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh was able to mount an intermittently effective counter to its Naxalite problem. The TDP, which came to power in 1983, initially pursued a policy of appeasement with the PWG in an effort to lure them to peace talks. When it became clear that the group had no intention of negotiating in good faith (and had, in fact, used the opportunity to consolidate and strengthen their positions), the state’s Chief Minister, N.T. Rama Rao, adopted a hard line against the Naxalites.178 Rao authorized aggressive policing measures against PWG cadres and oversaw the formation of the Greyhounds, the state’s elite anti-Naxal police unit, in the late 1980s.179 Though he supported aggressive security measures, Rao did not neglect the rural development initiatives that had proved so successful in West Bengal. Land reform and rural employment initiatives were implemented with moderate success, but a lack of government infrastructure in remoter parts of the state made their implementation there difficult.180 In 1989, the INC returned to power in state elections, but initially made the same early mistakes as the TDP. The new Chief Minister, Chenna Reddy, tried to 176 Prakash Singh, 179. 177 Mehra, 56; Prakash Singh, 236. 178 Prakash Singh, 139. 179 Andhra Pradesh State Police, “Units: Greyhounds,” http://www.apstatepolice.org/AboutUs/units/units_greyhounds.htm (accessed February 4, 2008). 180 K.C. Suri, “Telugu Desam Party,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 294-295. 54 appease the PWG in a vain attempt to lure them into the mainstream, releasing several hundred Naxalite prisoners rounded up under the previous administration.181 When this approach failed again, Reddy reverted to Rao’s combination of tough policing and socio\u0002economic development. Despite these ups and downs, the state was relatively successful in confining the PWG to the Telangana region and a few neighboring districts throughout the 1980s. By contrast, the containment of the MCC and Party Unity in Bihar had little to do with the state government. The Janata Party captured control of the state briefly, from 1977 to 1980, but the remainder of this period was dominated by INC administrations. In reality, however, it scarcely mattered who controlled the government. Corruption, cronyism, and maladministration took root in Bihar in the 1970s and continued to flourish through the 1980s.182 Unable to mount effective security or development initiatives of any kind, the government essentially left the rural parts of the state to their own devices, providing space for the embers of Naxalism to smolder. While the growth of caste conflict in the state, as well as internecine fighting between the MCC and PU, were enough to keep the Naxalites more or less in check during these decades, the state’s appallingly poor governance would become an issue in the future resurgence of Naxalism. E. CONCLUSION The Fragmentary Period was a prolonged low point in the history of Naxalism in India. After its brief but significant surge from 1967 to 1972, the movement underwent a period of stagnation and decay that lasted nearly two decades and effectively removed it from the public consciousness. Though not as captivating a story as the vitality of the previous period, the impotence of the movement and its singular inability to gain traction during these years are still worthy of examination. 181 Sanjoy Hazarika, “Indian Rebel Group is Linked to Train Attack,” New York Times, October 21, 1990. 182 Prakash Singh, 148-150. 55 The most obvious reason for the failure of Naxalism in this period was its own organizational weakness. Fractured into dozens of smaller, competing factions, it was too dispersed and fragmented to mount any kind of meaningful challenge to the forces of the Indian state. In large part, this was a failure of leadership. Consumed by their personal egos, strategic and tactical differences, and ideological arguments incomprehensible to any but the most dogmatic Marxists, the heads of the various Naxalite organizations were utterly incapable of resolving their disputes and coordinating the activities of their disparate groups. As a consequence, a large portion of the movement effectively abandoned the revolutionary line, and those that remained were confined to a few small pockets of activity in the hinterlands. With the structure of the movement in such a state, its success would have been unlikely in even a permissive security environment. As it turned out, the security environment was decidedly unfavorable. The imposition of the Emergency in the 1970s granted the state a great deal of leeway in dealing with opposition movements, and it used them to devastating affect against the already fragmented Naxalites. Indeed, the movement was very nearly destroyed by policing actions like Operation Thunder and the imprisonment of hundreds, if not thousands of its activists. The situation in the 1980s was hardly any better. Though New Delhi’s aggressive reactions to the various secessionist uprisings in the country were not directed against the Maoists, they still provided a powerful deterrent effect. Lastly, the social, economic, and political conditions in the country were not conducive to the spread of Naxalite ideology. Political changes at the systemic level gave a new voice to groups the Maoists traditionally relied on for support, making the government more responsive to their needs. As a result, land reforms and rural development became a priority at both the state and national levels. While these programs were not always perfectly implemented, poverty rates did decline, and real and perceived inequity were alleviated to some degree. These issues had been drivers of rural unrest in the previous period, and the government’s efforts to address them proved generally successful in keeping the countryside peaceful during these decades. 56 To most observers in 1991, the Naxalist threat appeared to be over. The movement had been wiped out in the state of its birth, sizeable numbers of its former adherents were embracing electoral democracy, and, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Communism was being discredited around the world. In isolated pockets of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, however, the embers of the Maoist revolution continued to smolder. In places the rural reforms had scarcely reached, the People’s War Group, Maoist Communist Center, and Party Unity continued to cling to existence, waiting for the right moment to reignite the fire of Naxalbari. 57 IV. THE RECONSOLIDATION PERIOD (1991-PRESENT) A. INTRODUCTION With an analysis of the first two periods of Naxalite activity complete, this chapter now turns to the most recent iteration of Maoist violence in India. In an examination of the historical evolution of Naxalism, the period from 1991 to the present is certainly the most paradoxical. In the course of little more than 17 years, India has transformed from a large, but isolated and relatively weak state, to one of the central players in the emerging geopolitical order. Its macroeconomic growth is astounding, second only to China in the developing world, and its diplomatic clout on the world stage has increased commensurately. To many outside observers, India looks to be successfully integrating itself into the modern world. And yet, in those same 17 years, an archaic Communist ideology, rejected even in the place of its birth, was also in the ascendancy. Written off by most security analysts in the ashes of the Fragmentary Period from 1972-1991, Naxalism staged a spectacular comeback in the following decades, growing in scope, breadth, and violence. By 2006, its impact was so great that Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was forced to declare, “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problem of Naxalism is the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”183 This is certainly a startling announcement for a nation that suffered through the chaos of Partition, witnessed the violence of a Sikh rebellion in the Punjab, and is still confronted by the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, various insurgencies in the Northeast, fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and continuing Hindu-Muslim communal strife. What explains Naxalism’s phoenix-like rebirth in a period that has witnessed such phenomenal growth and national development? 183 Manmohan Singh, “Prime Minister’s Speech to the 2nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of Chief Ministers on Naxalism,” 13 April 2006, Government of India Press Information Bureau, http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=17128, (accessed August 10, 2007). 58 B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments Since 1991, the most striking development in Indian politics has been the emergence of a truly multi-polar power structure. The declining hegemony of the INC (discussed in the previous chapter) dramatically accelerated during the 1990s, fuelled by the emergence of the “Three M’s” on the political scene: Mandir, Mandal, and Market Reforms.184 In 1998, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition unseated the previous INC administration and inaugurated the longest period of uninterrupted rule by a non\u0002Congress party since independence. Though the INC returned to power in 2004, the BJP’s ascendancy in the 1990s definitively marked the end of one-party dominance in India, resulting in a more complex and contentious political setting than at any other time in the nation’s history. Minority governments and coalition politics are now the order of the day, severely restricting New Delhi’s freedom of action in addressing many pressing issues. In many ways, this increasing gridlock at the national level is reflected in interactions between the central government and those of the states. India’s political structure is distinctly federal, with the 28 state and 7 union territory governments retaining high levels of autonomy from New Delhi, barring the infrequent imposition of ‘President’s Rule’ from the center. This is particularly true with respect to internal security, an area in which the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India grants the individual states great authority and latitude.185 Such a division of powers presents obvious problems for policy coordination, especially when different parties control the various levels of government. This situation was not much of an issue in earlier decades, 184 ‘Mandir’ refers to Hindu Nationalism, ‘Mandal’ to the recommendations of the Mandal Commission report on the status of backward castes, and ‘Market Reforms’ to the economic reforms inaugurated in 1991. For an excellent exposition of these phenomena and their impact on Indian politics, see: Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952- 2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed.

Previously, operations in remote and interior areas used to be paused during the rains, inadvertently giving space to Maoists to carry out recruitment drives or hold meetings with villagers. For the past three-four years, however, specially trained units of state and central security forces have pressed on with operations in forests in monsoon, resulting in the killing of 29 Maoists in encounters since 2020. The past years’ operations have been an example against the perceived notion that security forces wouldn’t be able to carry out operations due to overflowing nullahs, canals and slippery terrain in the forests of Bastar, a Police officer said. Bastar range Inspector general of Police (IGP) Sundarraj P told that security camps established in more than 60 spots in the remote areas have “choked the Maoists” and become “bottleneck points” for movement of the insurgents, while giving forces access to the forests. “Earlier, operations would be stalled but for the past 3-4 years, our ops continue during the (rainy) season, bringing results. CRPF \\[Central Reserve Police Force\\], CoBRA \\[Commando Battalion for resolute Action\\] and Special Task Force \\[STF\\] will be carrying out operations as they are well trained in jungle warfare. An action plan is in place to deal with the challenges of monsoon in the forest and conduct searches,” Sundarraj said. The inter-state operations on bordering areas like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra will also be intensified in the coming weeks and the jawans were well equipped for it. The morale of SFs is high despite casualties, the senior Police officer said. “We have recorded significant positive operational outcomes during this monsoon, since we have made decisive inroads into the erstwhile Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] strongholds by opening strategic operational base camps,” said Sundarraj. **Read less...** | | July - 12 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kot **Read more...** The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kothagudem of Telangana on July 12, reports Telangana Today. Jagan called upon the public to revolt against the ‘fascist Brahmanical Hindutva agenda of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of the UCC. As the people’s opposition towards the BJP’s nine-year rule was on the rise, the BJP was planning to execute its divisive and communal agenda. Through the UCC, Hindutva forces want to create a nefarious divisive line based on religion prior to the five state elections and the general election in 2024. In the last nine years of Narendra Modi's rule, the Indian economy has witnessed prolonged stagnation and decline, he said. Poverty, diseases, the gap between the rich and the poor, and attacks on minorities, dalits, and adivasis have reached levels never seen before. More than 800 million people have been pushed below the poverty line. Jagan noted that the BJP was trying to divert all these from the public’s mind. There would be a threat to the religious rights of minorities, tribals, and even Hindus because of the UCC. The BJP was also dehumanising the Muslim community and wrongly projecting them. There was a need to build a mass movement against the UCC, Jagan added. **Read less...** | | July - 13 | The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. The Maoist leaders for whom wanted notices were issued are Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, and Venkata Ravi Chaitanya alias Aruna. In its statement, the NIA said Aruna and Gajarla Ravi are the key executors of the Maoist strategies in Andhra Pradesh. The NIA informed us further that Aruna led the Maoist group that killed the former MLAs. The double murder took place while Kidari Sarveshwara Rao and Siveri Soma were visiting an interior village in the Araku assembly constituency of Andhra Pradesh. NIA re-registered the case on December 6, 2018 and took up the investigation. In June 2021, the NIA filed a supplementary chargesheet in the case against a woman area committee member of the Maoist group. The NIA said the woman Maoist leader, whom they identified as Kalavathi alias Bhavani, was instrumental in providing logistical support to the team that carried out the killing. **Read less...** | | July - 14 | Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Time **Read more...** Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Times of India on July 15. Maharashtra forces, which have already alerted the Central Government about the Maoists trying to bounce back in Chhattisgarh, have put their security and intelligence units on high alert on the stretch between Kanker-Narayanpur and Bijapur national park. A senior official from the security and intelligence wings said around 1,000 cadres have been recruited by the Maoists in Dantewada and Sukma regions. Another 200–250 new cadres were recruited by the Maoists in South Bastar. \"Earlier, there were barely 50–100 cadres in south Bastar and 200–400 in Dantewada and Sukma, which now have swelled to a substantial number after fresh recruitment,\" said the official. He said the concern was that Maoists would regroup and try to bounce back to their former strength in Chhattisgarh, which would not augur well for Gadchiroli and Gondia across the border in Maharashtra. Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) Sandip Patil, also the chief of the Anti-Naxal Operations (ANO) for Maharashtra, said the central government has been briefed about the developments in Chhattisgarh, which may now affect Maharashtra too, but did not divulge further details. \"Maharashtra forces are ready with strategies to counter any fresh threats,\" he said. It’s been learned that the Maoists are planning major attacks on Police posts that the Governments of different states are opening in their strongholds in central India. The Maoists’ ‘technical and research’ wing is said to be developing Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED) to blow them up near Police posts after mounting them on tractors or four-wheelers used in the rural areas. The Maoists are also developing drones to carry and drop up to five kilograms of explosives on Police Stations. In the latest issue of their mouthpiece, the Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] claim to have well responded to the aerial attacks and surveillance in Chhattisgarh with their counter strategy. **Read less...** | | July - 15 | To choke the flow of funds to Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists (LWEs)\\] in the state, the Bihar Police has intensified its crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts, reports Deccan Herald on July 16.

The anti-Naxal crackdown by the Special Task Force (STF) along with other Security Forces (SFs) has dried up the weapons pipeline, leading to the number of armed extremists dropping drastically in the state, said a senior Police officer. \"Now the Bihar Police, in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and other concerned wings of the government, have intensified their crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui districts in the state\", Sushil Mansingh Khopde, Additional Director General (ADG-operations), STF, said. The ADG said despite law enforcement agencies destroying hundreds of acres of poppy plants each year, inputs suggest that clandestine opium poppy cultivation is present in certain pockets in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts. \"Inputs also suggest that Maoists \\[Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist)\\] have been using opium cultivation as a source of revenue in these areas. They levy a 'tax' on poppy cultivators and small enterprises. Law enforcement agencies destroyed around 600 acres of poppy plantation in these areas in 2021, and in 2022, around 1200 acres were destroyed\", the ADG said, adding, \"The concerned district police and other agencies have been instructed to keep a vigil on clandestine opium poppy cultivation in specific areas in the district.\" Further, ADG Khopde said, \"The number of Maoist-affected districts will further reduce in the coming months. No major Maoist incidents have been reported till June this year. Some armed cadres are only concentrated on the hills of Chakarbandha on the Gaya-Aurangabad border near Jharkhand and in the hilly areas of Jamui and Lakhisarai-Munger.

In a press note issued on November 23, the OSD reminded people that Maoists had issued a statement urging the people to boycott the impending Assembly elections slated for November 30. He, however, reassured the public of the foolproof security arrangements in place to ensure the smooth conduct of the elections. The Maoist action team, reportedly comprising members such as Kunjam Idumal alias Mahender, Kovvasi Ganga alias Mahesh, and others, has reportedly crossed into the Mulugu area with intentions to disrupt the elections. Their strategies allegedly involve targeting security personnel, people’s representatives, political leaders, and officials involved in election duties, instigating fear and chaos among the public. “To combat this threat, Mulugu police have initiated stringent measures, including drone surveillance, cordon search operations, tactical vehicle checks, and area dominance,” the OSD said, emphasizing the grave risk posed by the Maoists to politicians and others, urging the people to remain vigilant and cautious. **Read less...** | | November - 23 | Jharkhand Chief Minister (CM) Hemant Soren, on November 23, declared that the state Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) are in the concluding stages of eliminating Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] menace in the state, reports The Telegraph.

He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&nbsp;_ _In this Q&A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world._ ## **The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it?** The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed.[1](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote1) So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( _see graph below_). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.[2](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote2) Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts.[3](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote3) Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. Close footnote ## How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also [targeted locals](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/) whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes.[4](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote4) Close footnote ## What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk.[5](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote5) And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so.

Not receiving a fair deal after India’s independence, the Naxals adopted Maoist ideology. By 2010 the insurgency engulfed one-third of India and posed a serious security challenge. Since then, the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments have adopted different strategies to curtail the insurgency, but it still persists. Against this backdrop, this article briefly discusses the historical antecedents; delineates in detail the operational strategies adopted by the Naxals, the counter-insurgency strategies adopted by the Congress and BJP governments; developmental challenges faced by the Adivasis; and suggests recommendations for how the President of India, an Adivasi herself, can be instrumental in containing the Naxal insurgency threats through empowerment. ## References Ahlawat, Dalbir. 2018. “Maoist Insurgency in India: Grievances, Security Threats and Counter-strategies.” Journal of Policing, Intelligence and Counter Terrorism 13(2): 252-266.

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with “unspecified casualties” on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi’s China and Modi’s India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China’s ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China’s abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India’s protest in denying Beijing’s claims as “exaggerated and untenable” is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi’s “clarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat”_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India’s active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China’s nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India’s nuclear strike range_** **_(right) – estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India’s national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China’s “containment of India,” the modernization of the PLA and its “growing assertiveness on the border”, and recommended a shift of India’s national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China’s unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or “string of pearls” that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India’s security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India’s peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China’s energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China’s power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China’s “Malacca dilemma,” by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing’s interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of “the quad”, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing’s ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India’s nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India’s boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India’s dismay. When BRI’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India’s doctrine of “strategic autonomy”. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek “equivalence” with the great powers — China, Russia, US — in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi’s party and support the base’s nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem “techno-nationalism”.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India’s dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India’s military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China’s relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. Commensurate to China’s 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a “peaceful rise” of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world’s longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India’s options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India’s strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India’s preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India’s “Neighborhood First” policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi’s ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal’s stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the “Asian Century” may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India’s geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide “chicken’s neck” connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China’s favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi’s strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India’s advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ”partners” with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh’s deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China’s border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its “like-minded partners” in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India’s diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war – for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India’s irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China’s assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-à-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, “wolf-warrior diplomacy”, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India – the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its “NORMS — New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System” approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India’s quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact – an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China – to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia – India’s soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter’s unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese “iron brother”, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China’s increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India’s disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled. In the _Art of War_, Sun Tzu posits, “a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.”\\[31\\] In their international positioning, whether it will be India or China’s thinking and preparedness that is victorious, only the real geopolitical battle will tell — one that far exceeds the LAC battlegrounds. * * * **References** [_**\\[1\\]**_](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/india-china-standoff-from-precarious-peace-to-the-point-of-no-return/?srsltid=AfmBOopMYRpkammY3JbuSv0VQLBVgNroFN1MwcBzigwT7ZYGZBeChO-Y#_ednref1) _Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas, New Delhi, November 29, 1996, United Nations Peacemaker, available from_( [https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%20IN\\_961129\\_Agreement%20between%20China%20and%20India.pdf](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%2520IN_961129_Agreement%2520between%2520China%2520and%2520India.pdf)).

assistance in setting it up using our simple webchat available at: [https://wikileaks.org/talk](https://wikileaks.org/talk) If you can use Tor, but need to contact WikiLeaks for other reasons use our secured webchat available at **http://wlchatc3pjwpli5r.onion** We recommend contacting us over Tor if you can.

In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor. #### Tails If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called [Tails](https://tails.boum.org). Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.

Please review these basic guidelines. #### 1\\. Contact us if you have specific problems If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please [contact us](https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/52/5286513_stratfor-india-country-brief-nov-2-2011-.html#submit_help_contact). In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations. #### 2\\. What computer to use If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use [Tails](https://tails.boum.org) to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer. #### 3\\. Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.

Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations. #### 2\\. Act normal If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour. #### 3\\. Remove traces of your submission If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used. In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media. If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion. #### 4\\. If you face legal action If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at [https://www.couragefound.org](https://www.couragefound.org). # Submit documents to WikiLeaks WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed.

The e-mails date between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods. ## STRATFOR India Country Brief - Nov. 2, 2011 Released on 2012-09-03 09:00 GMT | Email-ID | 5286513 | | Date | 2011-11-02 14:49:23 | | From | Anya.Alfano@stratfor.com | | To | fred.burton@stratfor.com, Declan\\_O'Donovan@dell.com, John\\_McClurg@DELL.com, Anders\\_De\\_La\\_Motte@Dell.com, Vinod\\_Dora@Dell.com | STRATFOR India Country Brief - Nov. 2, 2011 Basic Political Developments o A day after Anna Hazare threatened to launch another hunger strike if a strong Jan Lokpal Bill was not passed in the Parliament's Winter Session, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh today said his party is not afraid of the Gandhian's threats. o CBI has called Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for questioning on November 4 in connection with alleged multi-crore iron ore mining scam. o Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram, who arrived in Imphal on Wednesday on a two-day visit to Manipur, toured Naga-dominated interior Senapati hill district and appealed to people to settle all issues through dialogue. Inaugurating a mini-secretariat building at Senapati district headquarters, Mr. Chidambaram said all efforts would be made to bring peace, harmony and development in the state. o BJP leader L.K. Advani today asked the government to make public names of those who have stashed black money abroad and sought their immediate prosecution.\"Without any further delay prosecution must be initiated and appropriate follow up action taken,\" Mr. Advani said referring to the people whose names have been provided to India by various foreign governments in this regard. o The government Wednesday unveiled a bill that seeks to get committed standards of public service and redressal of grievances in a stipulated time frame. The Citizens Right to Grievance Redress Bill, 2011 will look at complaints of violation of the citizens' charter to be formulated by each government department, identify liabilities of public servants in case of default and impose penalities for failure to deliver services or redress grievances in a time-bound manner. o Taking exception to BJP leader LK Advani seeking answers on the PMO's role in the 2G issue, Law Minister Salman Khurshid today said as the case was already before the courts, a \"parallel trial\" cannot take place outside. National Economic Trends . A United Nations study has ranked India at 134 out of 187 countries in terms of Human Development Index even as it has observed that life expectancy at birth in the country has increased by 10.1 per cent a year over the last two decades. In the 2010 Human Development Report, prepared by UNDP, India had been ranked at 119 out of 169 countries. But the new report for 2011 says it is misleading to compare values and rankings with those of previously published reports, because the underlying data and methods have changed, as well as the number of countries included in the Human Development Index. Business, Energy or Environmental regulations or discussions o Gujarat NRE Coke has entered a $100 million (about 490 crore) long-term loan agreement to meet the capital investment requirements of its Australian subsidiary. o Larsen and Toubro (L&T)'s construction division has bagged new contracts worth Rs 1,629 crore in the buildings and factories segment. o Mining company Coal India Ltd (CIL) has got the Finance Ministry's nod for acquiring stake in overseas unlisted firms. o An equal joint venture agreement between state-run SAIL and South Korean major Posco is likely to be inked during Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma's proposed visit to Korea starting November 5. The shareholding pattern of the proposed venture is seen as a hurdle in signing the pact. The proposed joint venture aims to set up a plant at an investment of Rs 16,000 crore (Rs 160 billion) in Bokaro to produce three million tonne auto-grade steel.

Full Text Basic Political Developments Congress not worried by Anna's threats of fast, says Digvijaya Press Trust of India, Updated: November 02, 2011 17:22 IST http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/congress-not-worried-by-anna-s-threats-of-fast-says-digvijaya-146234 Rampur (Uttar Pradesh): A day after Anna Hazare threatened to launch another hunger strike if a strong Jan Lokpal Bill was not passed in the Parliament's Winter Session, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh today said his party is not afraid of the Gandhian's threats. \"Congress is neither bothered, nor afraid of Anna's threat to resume his fast on the last day of Parliament's Winter Session if the government fails to get a strong Jan Lokpal Bill passed by then,\" he said at a religious function in Sambhal town of Moradabad district, around 70 km from here. Digvijaya said Team Anna's claim that they have the support of over one crore people on the Jan Lokpal Bill issue is \"unfounded, hollow and fictitious\". Replying to a query on 'gupt daan' (secret donations) to the NGO, India Against Corruption, run by Arvind Kejriwal during Anna's hunger strike in Delhi, Singh said sarcastically, \"Na khata na bahi, jo Kejriwal kahe wahi sahi (There is no account book. Whatever Kejriwal says, is correct and unquestionable).\" CBI summons Jagan for questioning in alleged mining scam http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/andhra-pradesh/article2591464.ece CBI has called Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, son of former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, for questioning on November 4 in connection with alleged multi-crore iron ore mining scam. The agency is probing an alleged nexus between Mr. Jagan and Janardhana Reddy whose company Obulapuram Mining Company (OMC) has been accused of violating mining norms in the Ananthpuram district of Andhra Pradesh, CBI sources said. The clearance for mining leases to OMC was given during the tenure of Rajasekhara Reddy as Chief Minister. CBI has recently questioned the then cabinet colleagues of the late Rajasekhara Reddy in connection with the mining scam as it found that mining leases for OMC were cleared in an unusual haste, they said. Kadapa MP Jagan is also facing allegations of amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income as well as alleged dilution of stake of Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructural Corporation (APIIC) which is having a joint venture with Emaar for the development of township on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The sources said CBI has called Mr. Jagan for questioning in connection with these allegations on November 4 at the Hyderabad office of the agency. Chidambaram appeals for peace in Manipur PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2591394.ece Chidambaram appeals to Manipur groups to withdraw blockade Manipur: SHDC withdraws blockade Nagas call for three-day total blockade NIA will not oppose bail of Malegaon accused: Chidambaram 48-hour bandh in hill districts of Manipur from Monday Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram, who arrived in Imphal on Wednesday on a two-day visit to Manipur, toured Naga-dominated interior Senapati hill district and appealed to people to settle all issues through dialogue. Inaugurating a mini-secretariat building at Senapati district headquarters, Mr. Chidambaram said all efforts would be made to bring peace, harmony and development in the state. On October 31, Sadar Hills District Demand Committee SHDDC, which had launched economic blockades on Imphal-Dimapur -- Guwahati (NH-39) and Imphal-Jiribam-Silchar (NH-53), called off the 92-day strike after the state government assured them that their demands would be looked into. The SHDDC was demanding conversion of Kuki-dominated Sadar Hills area into Naga-majority Senapati district, Official said Mr. Chidambaram preferred to visit the interior hill district because both Nagas and Kukis there were well disposed towards the demand of the SHDDC for conversion of the Sadar Hills area into a full-fledged revenue district. Mr. Chidambaram would visit various parts of the interior hill district during his two-day visit. The minister after spending about one hour in the district visited another Naga-dominated district Ukhrul, bordering Myanmar, where he inaugurated a SDO office. Officials said he would hold a meeting with Chief Minister O Ibobi Singh to take stock of the law and order situation in Manipur. Meanwhile, the United Naga Council said it will continue its economic blockade on the two national highways on Manipur side and called a three-day bandh from midnight on Thursday to protest against the government's assurance of turning Sadar Hills area in Senapati district into a separate district. An UNC spokesman said the bandh will be supported by All Naga Students Association Manipur. He said the ongoing economic blockade on the Manipur parts of the NH 39 and NH 53 which the group had launched on August 21 would continue. He said the bandh would cover all Naga-settled areas in Manipur. Reveal names of black money account holders: Advani to govt. PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2591671.ece BJP leader L.K. Advani today asked the government to make public names of those who have stashed black money abroad and sought their immediate prosecution. \"Without any further delay prosecution must be initiated and appropriate follow up action taken,\" Mr. Advani said referring to the people whose names have been provided to India by various foreign governments in this regard. \"Already there is a talk about three MPs having been identified, and the Government of France has given India a list of names of those possessing illegal wealth in Swiss and other foreign banks. The country eagerly expects their names to be made public. The UPA government will try to evade the issue once again, as has been its dismal record,\" he told reporters here. Mr. Advani said the Directorate of criminal investigation of Income Tax department had sent notices to persons involved in black money cases following scrutiny of classified banking data received from foreign countries about Swiss bank accounts. \"This is an issue on which there should be no hush hush...All information with the government on money stashed away abroad should be shared,\" he demanded. The BJP leader said, \"I have repeatedly asked for a White Paper on the issue of black money giving facts, giving names and above all giving details of all the steps taken by the government to get back this money which legitimately belongs to India. I believe that it cannot be allowed to be kept in foreign banks.\" Mr. Advani said that the American think tank \\`Global Financial Integrity' had estimated the amount of Indian black money in foreign banks at around Rs. 25 lakh crores. \"It is a staggering amount,\" he said, adding that this money should be used for the development of rural India. Government unveils bill for time-bound public services http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/government-unveils-bill-for-time-bound-public-services/articleshow/10582090.cms NEW DELHI: The government Wednesday unveiled a bill that seeks to get committed standards of public service and redressal of grievances in a stipulated time frame. The Citizens Right to Grievance Redress Bill, 2011 will look at complaints of violation of the citizens' charter to be formulated by each government department, identify liabilities of public servants in case of default and impose penalities for failure to deliver services or redress grievances in a time-bound manner. Speaking about the bill, the Minister of State for Personnel V. Narayanasamy said its architechture will ensure an appropriate decentralised and citizen-friendly mechanism to redress public grievances. \"The citizen's charter will have to be defined by the authorities at various levels, including panchayats, municipalities, states and the centre. For every authority, there will be a Grievance Redress Officer,\" Narayanasamy told mediapersons at a joint briefing with Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh. He said the bill will be put up on the website of the department of personnel for 21 days for people to give their comments. \"We will like to introduce it (the bill) in the winter session (of parliament Nov 22-Dec 21) after cabinet approval,\" he said. Narayanasamy said the bill can be enacted as a central legislation under the concurrent list and cover central schemes and central government departments. It will provide a platform to states to make a grievance redressal mechanism for state schemes and departments. Ramesh said the bill was another landmark in the \"rights-based approach followed\" by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. \"It (the) bill gives people legal entitlement,\" he said. Parallel trial cannot take place outside courts: Salman Khurshid Published: Wednesday, Nov 2, 2011, 17:32 IST http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report\\_parallel-trial-cannot-take-place-outside-courts-salman-khurshid\\_1606519 Taking exception to BJP leader LK Advani seeking answers on the PMO's role in the 2G issue, Law Minister Salman Khurshid today said as the case was already before the courts, a \"parallel trial\" cannot take place outside. \"A parallel trial cannot go on outside the courts... There is a basic thing that I want Mr Advani to know, that there is a principle of sub judice that you cannot discuss what's happening in the court,\" he told reporters here. He said if things which are before the court are discussed outside, \"there is a danger that you will influence what the courts will do.\" Khurshid was reacting to Advani's comment that if the PMO felt that then Finance Minister P Chidambaram had not taken timely measures to prevent 2G scam, the Prime Minister should have permitted a probe against him. \"It was incumbent upon the Prime Minister to permit investigation into his(Chidambaram's) role instead of expressing confidence in him saying he is innocent.\" National Economic Trends India ranked 134th in terms of Human Development Index Press Trust of India, Updated: November 02, 2011 18:45 IST http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/india-ranked-134th-in-terms-of-human-development-index-146261 New Delhi: A United Nations study has ranked India at 134 out of 187 countries in terms of Human Development Index even as it has observed that life expectancy at birth in the country has increased by 10.1 per cent a year over the last two decades. In the 2010 Human Development Report, prepared by UNDP, India had been ranked at 119 out of 169 countries. But the new report for 2011 says it is misleading to compare values and rankings with those of previously published reports, because the underlying data and methods have changed, as well as the number of countries included in the Human Development Index. The report said India's Human Development Index (HDI) value for 2011 was 0.547 positioning the country in the 'medium human development category'. Neighbouring Pakistan was ranked at 145 (0.504) and Bangladesh at 146 (0.500) respectively in terms of HDI. It said between 1980 and 2011, India's HDI value increased from 0.344 to 0.547, an increase of 59 per cent or an average annual increase of about 1.5 per cent. However, the report pointed that the country's HDI of 0.547 was below the average of 0.630 for countries in the medium human development group and below the average of 0.548 for countries in South Asia. The HDI is a measure for assessing long-term progress in three basic dimensions of human development such as a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living. The report said the \"mean\" year of schooling for the country increased by 3.9 years between 1980 and 2011 and expected years of schooling increased by 3.9 years. Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh, who was present at the report release function, however, sounded dismissive about the figures in the report. He said a better way of analysing the progress made by countries including India is to measure comparative success they have achieved on this count in the last few years from their previous record rather than by the number of their positions in the international chart. Ramesh said such presentation of human development indices is \"grossly misleading\" and the country's progress in this respect should be seen from a 20-year perspective. He said India has made huge strides in the field of education and water supply system but admitted that the biggest block in the human development indices for India is in the field of sanitation where 58 per cent of open defecation in the world takes place in India. He also rued that a mere expenditure of Rs. 2000 crore in the field of sanitation is being made while the budget for water supply was Rs. 20,000 crore. Ramesh said that the answer to the problem of sanitation is massive public investment in the sector on the lines of what the Central Government has done in education sector.

Gujarat NRE's Australian subsidiary owns and operates two hard coking coal mines in New South Wales (NSW) province of Australia. The company produces 1.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of coking coal and has plans to increase the quantum to 6 MTPA by 2015. Last month, Gujarat NRE Coking Coal Ltd, the Australian subsidiary of the Kolkata-based company, secured approval from the NSW Planning Assessment Commission for a USD 122 million upgrade of its infrastructure at the NRE-1 mine in Russel Vale, Australia. The approval will enable the company to continue to mine up to 1 MTPA of coking coal from the mine over the next three years. Company Executive Chairman Arun Kumar Jagatramka said, \"The grant of the (long-term loan) facility agreement on the back of the approval granted by the NSW Planning Assessment Commission represents another significant milestone for the company.\" Gujarat NRE Coke ( GNCL) had announced last month that by the end of the year, it will make public the USD 250 million new investment plan for the Russell Vale mine, which is estimated to hold 337 million tonnes of coking coal reserves. The proposal is part of GNCL's USD 486 million investment plan for its Australian assets, where it aims to increase total production to 6 MTPA by 2015. Shares of the company were being traded at Rs 24.75 apiece on the BSE at 1415 hours, up 1.02 per cent from their previous close.

Coal India Ltd gets Finance Ministry's nod for acquiring unlisted foreign companies http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/power/coal-india-ltd-gets-finance-ministrys-nod-for-acquiring-unlisted-foreign-companies/articleshow/10580433.cms KOLKATA: Mining company Coal India Ltd (CIL) has got the Finance Ministry's nod for acquiring stake in overseas unlisted firms. \"We have received Union Finance Ministry's clarifications sought for overseas acquisitions. The ministry permitted (us) to go ahead with acquisition of unlisted firms,\" CIL chairman N C Jha said on the sidelines of the company's Foundation Day celebrations attended by Coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal. However, the Finance Ministry has not given complete relaxation to the norm of minimum 12 per cent internal rate of return (IRR) from such acquisitions. \"The Finance Ministry has said we can go ahead with the proposals even if the return is below 12 per cent if they are for strategic reasons, but those has to be cleared by them,\" Jha said. He said CIL received proposals offering IRR between 9 and 12 per cent. The Finance Ministry will scrutinise the deals offering below 12 per cent IRR. CIL, the world's largest coal miner, failed to strike any deal due to procedural delays in approval by the government. It had sought relaxation in two parameters of overseas acquisition norms, which were allowing them to acquire stake in unlisted firms, including those offering below 12 per cent IRR. Jha said they would now pursue with some of the proposals lying before them. SAIL, Posco likely to have equal stake in joint venture Last updated on: November 02, 2011 17:20 IST http://www.rediff.com/business/report/sail-posco-likely-to-have-equal-stake-in-jv/20111102.htm An equal joint venture agreement between state-run SAIL \\[ Get Quote \\] and South Korean major Posco is likely to be inked during Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma's proposed visit to Korea starting November 5. The shareholding pattern of the proposed venture is seen as a hurdle in signing the pact. The proposed joint venture aims to set up a plant at an investment of Rs 16,000 crore (Rs 160 billion) in Bokaro to produce three million tonne auto-grade steel. \"We may have 51 per cent equity or it could be 50:50,\" Verma told reporters when asked about the likely shareholding pattern in the JV. A senior official in the ministry, however, said the two parties have nearly reached an understanding to make it an equal joint venture. Posco's patented Finex technology, which would be used in the proposed new plant, is not being used any company other than Posco. Finex is an environment-friendly iron-making process where iron ore fines are directly used. There is also the iron ore price issue which is yet to be resolved, Verma said, adding that if all the pending issues were not cleared within next two days, he might even cancel his tour. The official, however, ruled out cancellation of Minister's visit to Korea. Verma is slated to leave Korea for Russia \\[ Images \\] on November 9 and come back to India on November 12. In Russia, he will attend the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signing ceremony between state-run iron ore miner NMDC and Russia's Severstal.

Activity in the Oil and Gas sector (including regulatory) Have sought EGoM meet on diesel, LPG rate hike: Oil Minister http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/oil-gas/have-sought-egom-meet-on-diesel-lpg-rate-hike-oil-minister/articleshow/10580545.cms NEW DELHI With oil companies losing Rs 333 crore per day on selling fuel below cost, Petroleum Minister S Jaipal Reddy has sought a meeting of a high-powered ministerial panel to decide on revising the rates of diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene. \"I have asked for a meeting of the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM),\" Reddy told reporters after a meeting with Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who heads the EGoM. State-owned oil firms are currently losing Rs 9.27 per litre of diesel, Rs 26.94 per litre of kerosene sold through the public distribution system ( PDS) and Rs 260.50 per 14.2-kg LPG cylinder supplied to households for cooking purposes. The EGoM \"meeting would take place before the Winter Session of Parliament\", beginning November 22, he said, adding that a decision on raising prices may \"not be easy\". The ministerial panel is essentially a consensus-building body of the Congress-led UPA government and comprises key allies like the DMK, TMC and NC. The allies had in September scuttled plans to limit the supply of subsidised LPG cylinders to 4-6 per household in a year so that subsidies can be cut. Reddy said his ministry would push for raising prices of all three regulated products, diesel, LPG and kerosene. On oil companies pressing for a hike in petrol prices, he said PSUs were fully empowered to take a view, keeping in mind rising crude oil prices and depreciating rupee. \"Our ministry does not administer\" the price of petrol, which was freed from government control in June last year, he said. Yesterday, HPCL Director (Finance) B Mukherjee had said that oil firms may have to raise petrol prices, as they were losing Rs 1.50 per litre at the current rates. Hindustan Petroleum sells gasoline in rare tender http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/oil-gas/hindustan-petroleum-sells-gasoline-in-rare-tender/articleshow/10580752.cms SINGAPORE: India's Hindustan Petroleum Corp has sold a rare gasoline cargo through a tender, industry sources said on Wednesday. The refiner sold 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes of 90 RON gasoline for Nov 25-27 loading to Vitol at a discount of $1.75 per barrel to Singapore quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, they said. It is unusual for the Indian state-owned refiner to export gasoline as it is usually a net importer of the product, sources in India said. The cargo was said to be not compatible with the domestic Indian specifications as its sulphur content was too high, they said. \"It's only a one time cargo, public sector units or state refiners don't ever sell gasoline unless it's off-specs, which cannot be sold in the domestic market, so this cargo didn't match the Euro III standards,\" said one of the sources. The sale of the cargo was due to a domestic surplus of the product, a second source said. Vitol is likely to use the cargo for blending purposes, they said. But this could not be verified. GAIL (India) earmarks $400 mn for Singapore LNG trading business in 2012 http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/oil-gas/gail-india-earmarks-400-mn-for-singapore-lng-trading-business-in-2012/articleshow/10580127.cms SINGAPORE: Gail (India) Ltd has earmarked USD 400 million for its new Singapore trading office to secure LNG and petrochemical product cargoes for delivery to India in 2012, Chairman and Managing Director B C Tripathi announced in Singapore today. Gail's Singapore office, which was inaugurated today but will begin trading next month on getting all formal approvals, will tie-up as much as USD 400 million worth of LNG cargoes and petrochemical products next year for delivery into India, he said after addressing a press conference. Ninety per cent of the trade would be in LNG from the initial start-up. \"India is a huge market for LNG and petrochemical products, while supply remains tight,\" stressed Tripathi, reaffirming Gail's commitment to energy development both within India and globally through an annual investment of USD 2 billion. He also disclosed that Gail was building shale gas expertise through participation in projects in the United States. \"The company is building expertise in shale gas and will participate in the Indian shale gas projects once the government announces its policy and development plans,\" he said. He said participation in US shale gas was a part of Gail's strategy to develop technology, expertise and know-how. Gail, along with its international partners in existing projects, will aggressively bid for shale gas concessions in India once the government puts them up for auction, which is expected to take place in about one year. Oil companies can decide on petrol price hike: Petroleum Ministry PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2591304.ece A day after State-owned oil companies pressed for a petrol price hike, the Petroleum Ministry today said it is up to the oil firms to decide on raising the rates of the deregulated commodity. \"It is for them (oil companies) to decide. They will take a decision at a right time,\" Oil Secretary G.C. Chaturvedi told reporters here. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) Director (Finance) B. Mukherjee had said on Tuesday that oil firms may have to raise petrol prices, as they were losing Rs. 1.50 per litre at the current rates. Mr. Chaturvedi said petrol is a deregulated commodity whose pricing is not decided by the government. \"The oil companies are empowered to take a view on it,\" he said. Indian Oil, HPCL and Bharat Petroleum had last hiked petrol prices by Rs. 3.14 a litre on September 16, when the Indian rupee was valued at about Rs. 48 per U.S. dollar. The exchange rate is now over Rs. 49 per U.S. dollar. \"From today, there are some losses on petrol. To cover them, we may have to increase prices,\" Mr. Mukherjee had said on Tuesday. He had stated that crude oil is hovering at around $108 per barrel in international markets. At the current exchange rate, the petrol price of Rs. 66.84 per litre in Delhi is equivalent to a crude oil price of about $102 per barrel. The government had in June last year deregulated, or freed, petrol from all price controls, but the retail rates have not moved in line with the cost as high inflation forced the oil companies to seek \"advice\" from the parent Oil Ministry before revising rates. Mr. Mukherjee did not say when petrol prices would be hiked. \"We are in consultations,\" he said, without elaborating. The loss on petrol is currently Rs. 1.50 per litre and after including local levies, the desired increase in retail prices is Rs. 1.82 per litre. \"Let's say, we are toying with the idea,\" he said. \"It may happen. We will see,\" he added. Besides petrol, the three firms are losing Rs. 333 crore per day on selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene below cost. They lose Rs. 9.27 per litre on diesel, Rs. 26.94 per litre on kerosene sold through the public distribution system (PDS) and Rs. 260.50 per 14.2-kg LPG cylinder supplied to domestic households for cooking purposes. At the current rate, the industry is projected to lose Rs. 121,459 crore in revenue on the sale of diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene in the full fiscal. While the loss on these three products is compensated through a combination of government cash subsidy and upstream oil firm dole-outs, there exists no such mechanism for making good the losses on petrol, as the product is deregulated Militant Activity/Terrorism (Particularly in Bangalore, Mumbai, Noida, Chennai, Coimbatore) All 15 kidnapped by Maoists in Bihar traceless PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2591362.ece The 15 people abducted by Maoists in Bihar's Jamui district on Monday are yet to be traced even as securitymen intensified operations to rescue them. \"There is still no trace of the kidnapped persons.

Maoists kidnapped the 15 - eight labourers, four employees of a private construction company and three villagers - from Balthar Ghat. Late on Monday night, over 50 ultras stormed into the office of a private firm engaged by Bihar State Bridge Corporation for construction of a bridge over Bharnar River and took them away at gun point to a forest bordering Giridih district of Jharkhand. Ulfa hardliners warn of fresh attacks http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Ulfa-hardliners-warn-of-fresh-attacks/articleshow/10578603.cms GUWAHATI: After opposing the ongoing peace process and stating that the political conflict between India and Assam could only be resolved by holding discussions on \"sovereignty\", Ulfa hardliners on Tuesday issued a fresh warning of launching attacks on government transport, politicians, black marketers and corrupt officials. In an email sent by Arunodoy Dohotia, the chief of Ulfa's publicity wing, the hardliners asked the public to maintain safe distance from people belonging to any of the above mentioned categories. \"We want to alert everyone to keep away from government transport, vehicles of corrupt politicians and companies utilizing the resources of the state improperly, black marketeers and corrupt officials to avoid any kind of action,\" said Dohotia in the email. Meanwhile, the split between Ulfa hardliners and Arabinda Rajkhowa-led pro-talks faction has once again come to the fore with both sides involved in a mudslinging on the topic of \"sovereign Assam\". Another email sent by pro-talks Ulfa faction's publicity wing member Kamal Kachari rubbished the demand of \"sovereign\" Assam by saying that it has lost relevance in in today's time. \"The state is not asking for an armed movement. Paresh Baruah should not comment on the demand of Assam's sovereignty by staying at a distance. His demand has no relevance in today's time and is very immature,\" said Kachari. He added that the ongoing peace process will not be hampered by Paresh Baruh's personal statements. \"Though Baruah claims to represent the Assamese people, the commoners here don't want any more violence,\" he said in the email. On the other hand, pro-talks Ulfa leader Jiten Dutta was arrested for contempt of court on Tuesday. Dutta was held for not being present in the TADA court several times. He was taken to Guwahati Central Jail in the evening. Naxals gun-down villager on suspicion of being police informer http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/MP-RAI-naxals-gun-down-villager-on-suspicion-of-being-police-informer-2536070.html Raipur: A native of Aljam villge in Khadgaon, Rajanadgaon district, was shot dead by Naxalites on Monday night. The victim was dragged out of his house at night and tried in a Naxal \\`court' where he was found guilty of being a police informer. He was granted the death penalty and shot dead. Naxalites, who were reported to be around 40 in number, also asked all villagers to see the proceedings. More than 35 people have been shot dead in last 2-3 months by Naxalites for the same reason. Police say the act was to instill fear amongst villagers. Naxal activities have been on the rise in Rajanandgaon in recent times. In another brazen act seen recently, Naxalites entered an MLA's residence, snatched his gunner's weapon and escaped. Govt tightens railway security in Naxal areas http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/govt-tightens-railway-security-in-naxal-areas\\_739291.html New Delhi: The government on Tuesday decided to deploy additional forces to protect railway properties and tracks and install CCTV cameras at vulnerable stations located in Naxal-hit areas to check continuous attacks by extremists. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting, convened by Union Home Secretary R K Singh and attended by Railway Board Chairman Vinay Mittal and police chiefs of West Bengal, Orissa and Jharkhand. The meeting decided to augment the Railway Protection Force Personnel (RPF) in Maoist affected areas in coordination with State police forces to protect railway stations, tracks, godowns and intensify patrolling to ensure smooth running of trains, official sources said. Close Circuit Television Cameras will also be installed at vulnerable stations located in Naxal affected states to prevent extremist attacks. Dedicated officers will also be put in three designated places round the clock to coordinate security in railway properties, particularly on inter-state borders of West Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. Home Ministry officials are particularly concerned that Maoists have been attacking on goods trains loaded with coal and iron ore affecting industrial activities in different parts of the country as major coal and iron ores mines are located in these states. \"The meeting focused on systemic improvement of railway security,\" an official said. Currently, night running of trains has been suspended along two railway lines passing through the Naxal belt. There were 45 attacks on railway properties in 2010 and 23 this year till October 15. Labor/Social Unrest Pilots stir: Air India pilots move High Court http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/pilots-stir-air-india-pilots-move-high-court/articleshow/10575183.cms MUMBAI: A group representing a section of pilots of Air India has moved the Bombay High Court, challenging the management's decision to train pilots of the carrier's domestic operations in flying the latest Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft. In its petition, the Indian Pilots' Guild (IPG) has alleged discrimination on part of the management at the national carrier in giving opportunities for career progression to the pilots of the erstwhile Indian Airlines. Despite the merger of the two state-owned carriers in 2007, issues of integration of pilots remain to be resolved at the cash-strapped airline. The matter, which will come up for hearing on November 2, will most likely be disposed the same day as training for batches of pilots is scheduled to commence the next day. On Tuesday, Air India's international operations suffered due to crew crunch as 23 IPG pilots reported sick. The pilots met the management, but the meeting did not resolve the crisis. The airline, in a statement, however said the pilots will not be going on strike and that operations will be normal. The IPG, which represents about 250 pilots from the airline's international operations, had written to Rohit Nandan, chairman and managing director on October 29, seeking a no-objection certificate for about 100 pilots so that they can find jobs elsewhere. \"We feel cheated by management's unfair and discriminatory decisions leading to a complete stall of our career progression,\" the letter said. Before the merger, Indian Airlines was to get 15 A330 wide body aircraft. \"But since it was decided that the two airlines will be merged, the deal to get the 15 A330s was done away with,\" said a senior commander who is currently flying A320s. \"We were made to understand that since Air India will get the Dreamliners (787s) there was enough scope for us to progress to wide body aircraft.\" The IPG and the pilots union of the erstwhile Indian Airlines, or the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), had agreed to send 16 sets of pilots each for training for the 787, at a meeting with the management two months ago. In December 2010, the then Air India chief Arvind Jadhav had allotted 40 slots of Boeing 787 to the Air India narrow body pilots, a move opposed by the IPG in a letter dated February 15, as an illegal and arbitrary order. The IPG alleges that the management's move to allow ICPA pilots to fly wide body aircraft is a violation of Air India Pilots' wage document and deed of recognition. Senior pilots in Air India say that pilots of ICPA who are flying narrow body aircraft are allowed to fly aircraft on Alliance Air (its domestic regional subsidiary) and they should do so as it flies narrow body aircraft fleet instead of eating into IPG's pie. The ICPA also claims that the commanders of Air India that are supposed to fly the 787 have much less number of flying hours. -- Anya Alfano Briefer STRATFOR T: 1.415.404.7344 \\| M: 221.77.816.4937 www.STRATFOR.com",

The two main actors that constitute the best hope for global growth are obviously India and China. Of the two, India is in many ways the better bet. The country’s ‘bottom-up’ economic model (enabling it to better withstand systemic shocks), its demographic composition and its democratic system provide it with a future outlook that is brighter than China’s. Also, it is impressive that, despite endemic corruption, poor infrastructure, and a currently weak and directionless Congress Party-dominated government, India’s economy maintains a growth rate of 6%. Moving into an era of multipolarity, the importance of enhancing ties with a rising power like India is of great strategic importance for the West. At the same time, though, India is facing internal security pressures, albeit largely unknown to many investors and policy makers. Large swaths of Indian territory are plagued by conflict between the state and the long-running Maoist insurgency group known as the Naxalites. If not dealt with effectively, the Naxalites might prove to be too much for New Delhi and turn out to be India’s Achilles heel imperiling its phenomenal global rise. The current manifestation of Maoist-inspired violence in India can be traced back to the period immediately following the country’s independence in 1948. The term Naxal or Naxalite is derived from the Indian village of Naxalbari (West Bengal) where the movement has its roots. The stated goal of the Naxalites was, and remains to this day, to free the poor from the clutches of the landlords, to implement land reforms and destroy the oppressive feudal order in India. A central part their strategy to achieve this goal has been a guerrilla war against government forces in the underdeveloped rural and tribal regions of India. Although the nature of the movement makes it difficult to estimate the group’s size, recent estimates by The Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence service, have placed the numerical strength of the Naxalites at some 20,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. These numbers would suggest that the Naxalites are almost twice as big as the FARC movement in Columbia, which numbered around 11,000 operatives in 2009. The Naxalites’ organizational structure includes an elaborate hierarchy with a Central Committee at the top, followed by Regional Bureaus, Zonal or State Committees, and District or Division Committees. Following a period of internal strife and fractional splits, in 2004 the a merger occurred to create an umbrella organizational structure for the Naxalite insurgency. This reunification was followed by an upswing in the level of violence. Like all successful or enduring insurgent groups, the Naxalites follow a two-tiered strategy, using violence against their opponents as well as engaging in socio-economic initiatives to win the support of the population. With regard to the latter, it is important to note that the Naxalite insurgency puts much effort into addressing the grievances of the marginalised poor, who are disappointed in – or even hostile towards – the Indian government. For instance, Naxalite fighters have campaigned for women’s rights, have tried to improve the housing situation of those in need, have organised railway strikes, and have run irrigation projects to help farmers increase their harvests. The violent actions that make up the other second pillar of he Naxalite strategy are mostly aimed against the police, Indian government officials and transnational corporations. These attacks are intended to shield the population from capitalist influence. The Naxalites are quite successful in this regard, as the group has managed to take control of certain regions, especially in the Red Corridor, where state power has been eroded or has collapsed altogether. Several factors account for the Naxalites’ ability to pull off tours de force of this kind. First, the manpower that the Indian insurgents brings to bear, gives them the organisational clout needed to wage a large-scale campaign. Second, although the Naxalites are geographically dispersed and not centrally led, the group shows a remarkable commitment to the overall strategy. Although the group’s operatives occasionally lash out at the local population, Naxalite actions generally fit the ambition to create Naxalite-controlled areas to encircle the cities and eventually take over the country. The third explanation of the insurgency’s sustainability is the fact that many Naxalite operatives are active in their native areas. From this, they derive knowledge of the terrain, crucial in irregular warfare, as well as familiarity with the local population and its plight, which makes it unlikely that they will be perceived as interlopers. Another factor that makes it unlikely that the Naxalite insurgency will soon be a thing of the past is the inadequacy of the Indian government’s response. While it is clear that discrimination and poverty of the rural population provide the Naxalites with a support base and a pool of potential recruits, the government’s measures to alleviate the living conditions of the rural poor are generally half-hearted and poorly implemented. Rather, the government tries to quell the insurgency by taking a hard approach with a central role for law enforcement agencies. Thus far however, this hard line has not yielded the desired results. The number of police forces deployed against the Naxalites was recently increased to 76,000, but the insurgency is still alive and kicking. And even regardless of the effectiveness of the government line, it remains to be seen whether it is sustainable. India is one of the most underpoliced countries in the world, and there is little chance that the government will deploy the army, reluctant as it is to start a long and messy campaign and to take forces away from Jammu and Kashmir. It appears that the Naxalites are here to stay. All too often, analyses of India are based on the assumption that its rise is inevitable and effortless. For a long time, the western view was that the rest of the world held little allure to the west, but now, the received wisdom on India at business and international relations conferences is an overcompensation of earlier neglect and underestimation. This overly sunny view is as misguided as the prior arrogance. What is needed is a sober analysis of India’s economy and internal security situation. The goal of this article has certainly not been to denigrate the future potential of India or to engage in fear mongering. Rather, we have tried to draw attention to an important actor on the Indian scene that until now has received only minimal international attention. Adding this dimension to current thinking about India will allow investors and policy makers to make informed decisions on when, how and where to invest their money in India. If India is serious about defeating the Naxalites, they will need to deal with the root causes of the group’s appeal in the Red Corridor, which will require addressing poverty, corruption and tribal inclusion issues. Only by doing so can India retain the domestic stability that is a prerequisite for its continued phenomenal rise. ### About The Author ## Article Discussion: ![Small Wars Journal by Arizona State University](https://smallwarsjournal.com/wp-content/themes/swj/images/logo_icon.svg) ### Become a Member To Engage!

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively.

Ashley, ‘How the Spectre of Hindutva Captured Politics in Kerala,’ The Wire, 30 October 2020](https://thewire.in/politics/kerala-elections-hindutva-muslims) The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

According to Anthropic, Chinese state-linked hackers had used the company&rsquo;s Claude AI to automate a sophisticated global espionage campaign that targeted nearly 30 top-tier organisations, ranging from technology giants and financial institutions to chemical manufacturers and government agencies. advertisement The attack marked an alarming moment in cybersecurity as the perpetrators had moved beyond using AI solely as an assistant, enabling Claude&rsquo;s agentic capabilities to operate independently through clever manipulation of its safety protocols. Experts in New Delhi believe that this raises serious national security concerns for India, as critical infrastructure, such as power grids, financial networks, defence installations and government databases, could be targeted in ways that conventional cybersecurity measures may struggle to detect. The experts pointed out that the strategic and defence implications were equally significant. &ldquo;State-backed AI-driven operations could enable adversaries to gather intelligence on Indian military technology, missile programmes or strategic initiatives, undermining India&rsquo;s technological advantage and increasing the risk of information warfare,&rdquo; cautioned a China watcher, adding that the economic and industrial sectors, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, advanced manufacturing and AI research, were particularly vulnerable since autonomous AI can rapidly exfiltrate research and intellectual property, threatening competitiveness and forcing companies to invest heavily in internal cybersecurity measures. By disguising offensive operations as defensive cybersecurity tests, the hackers successfully broke down complex attack sequences into harmless-appearing prompts, which Claude executed at superhuman speed. The AI autonomously mapped networks, identified critical databases, wrote tailored exploits, harvested credentials and organised stolen data, completing up to 90 per cent of tactical actions with minimal human oversight. Human involvement was reduced to authorising escalation and directing transfers of sensitive information while the majority of hands-on infiltration, data mining and documentation were managed by the AI itself. This approach enabled the Chinese operators to achieve a level of efficiency and stealth impossible for manual attackers, marking the entry into a new era of cyberattack modus operandi. According to reports released by Anthropic in November, the Chinese state group GTG-1002 exploited Claude Code to automate every operational step in a campaign aimed at 30 global targets, including critical infrastructure. By using AI to evade safety checks and break attacks into innocuous tasks, the group triggered thousands of operations per second, prompting urgent calls within the cyber-defence community to reassess the threat landscape. advertisement Although Claude&rsquo;s autonomous capabilities enabled remarkable scalability, the AI&rsquo;s fabricated results required intermittent human validation—a gap Anthropic addressed by strengthening detection systems and sharing intelligence with authorities. The company&rsquo;s swift response, which included banning abusive actors and publicising the attack&rsquo;s details, underscored the growing risk posed by autonomous AI in lowering the barriers for large-scale cyber aggression. China has formally denied allegations of state involvement, dismissing the findings as unsubstantiated and reasserting its longstanding policy against cyberattacks. Nonetheless, experts from Anthropic and independent cyber intelligence continue to attribute the campaign to a state-backed effort, given its sophistication, resource depth and tactical complexity. Similar AI-driven operations by Chinese groups have previously targeted major infrastructure, from Vietnamese telecommunications to several government domains, and global AI providers like OpenAI and Google now report increasingly frequent state-linked misuse of their platforms. Indian cyber authorities responded to the September attack by underlining the nation&rsquo;s resilience against AI-powered threats and redoubling efforts to safeguard digital sovereignty. A key Indian cybersecurity expert said that India has invested in developing indigenous AI cyber-security tools, prioritising rapid threat detection, real-time response and autonomous network defence. These efforts are bolstered by the ongoing expansion of national security frameworks and a robust, skilled cyber workforce dedicated to countering adversarial AI warfare. advertisement The incident serves as a stark warning to democracies worldwide. With Chinese state-linked hackers now being accused of weaponising AI for scalable, minimally supervised cyberattacks, unified global defences and increased oversight have become critical imperatives. At the global level, autonomous cyberattacks underscore the geopolitical dimension of AI. India&rsquo;s response—investing in homegrown technology, building resilient networks and enhancing multilateral cooperation—demonstrates that proactive measures can mitigate AI-driven threats. Ankush Tiwari, CEO of pi-labs.ai, an AI technology company, said that large language models will increasingly be used to launch new kinds of cyberattacks, and the recent Claude incident is a clear reminder that these threats will be more sophisticated and easier to execute than anything seen before. &ldquo;As a nation, we must shift from a reactive mindset to a proactive one, especially when it comes to securing our critical infrastructure. India needs a dedicated national taskforce focused specifically on both AI-enabled threats and threats targeting AI systems and other vital digital assets. For too long, cybersecurity has been treated as an afterthought in our digital ecosystem. That approach must change urgently and decisively,&rdquo; Tiwari said. The September attack serves as a wake-up call, emphasising that AI-powered espionage is no longer theoretical, and nations must combine technological readiness, strategic foresight and robust governance to protect security, economic competitiveness and democratic stability. advertisement ****[**Subscribe to India Today Magazine**](https://subscriptions.intoday.in/indiatoday?utm_source=Insights)**** - Ends Published By: Shyam Balasubramanian Published On: Nov 20, 2025 [**Watch Live TV](/livetv?utm_source=articlePage&amp;utm_medium=articlePageLiveTV&amp;utm_campaign=LIVETVarticlePage) Advertisement ## Also Watch [ ![](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/video/202512/pm-045953745-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=vqOUB3R2LfY0XBBjh1mAEvavkg5Io.Ie&amp;size=200:113 \"Vladimir Putin lands in Delhi, PM Modi welcomes him with a hug at Palam airport\") 00:00:52 ](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/russian-president-vladimir-putin-lands-in-delhi-2830823-2025-12-04) ### [Vladimir Putin lands in Delhi, PM Modi welcomes him with a hug at Palam airport](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/russian-president-vladimir-putin-lands-in-delhi-2830823-2025-12-04) [ ![Putin: Modi Won’t Bow To US Pressure](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/video/202512/putinmodiwontbowtouspressure-s0-original-sixteen-to-nine.jpg?VersionId=88waFsFUUHQkPv50SkckP7W4H6Be8tk7&amp;size=200:113 \"Exclusive: Putin hails PM Modi’s stance against US pressure, calls India ‘great power’\") 00:05:41 ](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/exclusive-putin-hails-pm-modis-stance-against-us-pressure-calls-india-great-power-ytvd-2830613-2025-12-04) ### [Exclusive: Putin hails PM Modi’s stance against US pressure, calls India ‘great power’](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/exclusive-putin-hails-pm-modis-stance-against-us-pressure-calls-india-great-power-ytvd-2830613-2025-12-04) [ ![Putin: Car Ride With Modi Was My Idea, Symbol of Dosti](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/video/202512/putincarridewithmodiwasmyideasymbolofdosti-s0-original-sixteen-to-nine.jpg?VersionId=q9Rs3sCIiChGqPgIqt4Eb77CRcawBGv9&amp;size=200:113 \"Putin on ‘dosti’ with Modi: Reveals truth behind car ride during SCO summit\") 00:05:11 ](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/exclusive-putin-reveals-story-behind-impromptu-car-ride-with-pm-modi-hails-indias-77-growth-ytvd-2830585-2025-12-04) ### [Putin on ‘dosti’ with Modi: Reveals truth behind car ride during SCO summit](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/exclusive-putin-reveals-story-behind-impromptu-car-ride-with-pm-modi-hails-indias-77-growth-ytvd-2830585-2025-12-04) [ ![Varanasi residents perform aarti for Putin ahead of India visit](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/video/202512/varanasi-residents-perform-aarti-for-putin-ahead-of-india-visit-041719444-16x9_0.png?VersionId=uL3uTzCCZ0WLGa_eBvz4ZVL.cikJGVG0&amp;size=200:113 \"Watch: Varanasi residents perform aarti for Putin ahead of India visit\") 00:10:02 ](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/varanasi-residents-perform-aarti-for-russian-president-vladimir-putin-ahead-of-india-visit-watch-video-2830427-2025-12-04) ### [Watch: Varanasi residents perform aarti for Putin ahead of India visit](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/varanasi-residents-perform-aarti-for-russian-president-vladimir-putin-ahead-of-india-visit-watch-video-2830427-2025-12-04) [ ![Operation Sagar Bandhu](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/video/202512/operation-sagar-bandhu-041805243-16x9_0.jpeg?VersionId=l8AzyBJJbcRAbH5VoShArpRSydypkzAA&amp;size=200:113 \"Operation Sagar Bandhu: India&#x27;s aid to Sri Lanka \") 00:01:16 ](https://www.indiatoday.in/newsmo/video/operation-sagar-bandhu-indias-aid-to-sri-lanka-2830699-2025-12-04) ### [Operation Sagar Bandhu: India&#x27;s aid to Sri Lanka](https://www.indiatoday.in/newsmo/video/operation-sagar-bandhu-indias-aid-to-sri-lanka-2830699-2025-12-04) Advertisement ## Read This [ ![Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri ](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/lando-norris-and-oscar-piastri-042446604-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=ABDtt7NfNOjyHqvkBaTPoEk2I36LEGTa&amp;size=200:113 \"Lando Norris not asking McLaren for favours as F1 title fight goes down to Abu Dhabi\") ](https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/formula-one/story/formula-one-2025-title-battle-lando-norris-no-favours-oscar-piastri-max-verstappen-2830899-2025-12-04) ### [Lando Norris not asking McLaren for favours as F1 title fight goes down to Abu Dhabi](https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/formula-one/story/formula-one-2025-title-battle-lando-norris-no-favours-oscar-piastri-max-verstappen-2830899-2025-12-04) [ ![Several Indigo flights cancelled](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/several-indigo-flights-cancelled-040641138-16x9_1.jpeg?VersionId=JKb2NjroswXREcOW7dJlYFvB_bi9fGzd&amp;size=200:113 \"IndiGo cites pilot shortage for mass flight cancellations;

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. ## Document Type Book ## Publication Date 10-2016 ## Publisher National Defense University Press ## City Washington, DC ## Recommended Citation Lynch, Thomas F.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures.

In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(ANNIRUDHA MOOKERJEE/AFP/Getty Images) For more than two months, Chinese and Indian forces have stood toe to toe on the Doklam Plateau. The standoff is just the latest manifestation of a border dispute that began long before Chinese soldiers tried to extend a road through the contested region June 16 -- and one that extends well past the area in question.

Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

In terms of tariffs against New Delhi, the ball's in America's court. (HARVEPINO/Shutterstock) ## Highlights - _The prospects of a U.S.-India trade war — which would be marked by U.S. tariffs on a wide range of Indian imports — will hinge on the outcome of a possible U.S. investigation into India's trade practices._ - _India, which recognizes it's a lower priority in U.S. trade negotiations, will be more likely to negotiate a trade package once a new government is formed after its national elections conclude later this month._ - _If India chooses to continue buying Iranian oil, it will buy a reduced amount under a rupee-based payment mechanism to avoid U.S. sanctions._ There's nothing like a common rival to bring two powers together -- at least on defense. India and the United States, both eyeing China's rise with concern, are moving closer militarily. Their common strategic interest in countering China, however, does not mean an alignment on trade: The United States is pushing India to further open its markets to American commerce, halt its purchase of Iranian oil and ease recent e-commerce regulations that could impede foreign investment. The demands, in fact, have even fueled speculation that India could emerge as a new front in U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war. But with limited ability to retaliate, India will seek to avoid any larger trade disputes with the United States, a vital export market. Even so, the prospects for a confrontation will ultimately depend on how the United States chooses to act. Washington has shown it has no qualms about launching trade disputes...

    "full_text": "Bangladesh will likely adopt a more assertive foreign policy, which will likely include strengthening ties with Pakistan while balancing its economic dependencies on India and maintaining cooperation on security and regional stability. On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

Organizations like the VHP are on the upswing as Hindu nationalism grows in India. (NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

Surrounding the golden fortress city of Jaisalmer in India’s Thar desert, a sea of wind turbines stretches out across the arid landscape as far as the eye can see — visibly marking the world’s third-largest carbon emitter’s green power expansion. Engineers at a 30MW wind farm here operated by ReNew, one of India’s biggest clean energy developers, speak with pride about contributing to a national renewable capacity goal of 500GW by 2030. Yet not all of the country’s green power can be dispatched, with the energy grid emerging as a choking constraint. Sumant Sinha, chair and chief executive of ReNew, is confident India will “definitely” achieve its renewable capacity target. “I can see that we’ll get to 500GW, but we won’t be able to exceed it because there’s not enough transmission.” While India boasts one of the world’s largest transmission networks, spanning more than 494,000 circuit kilometres, the grid has not kept pace with the surge in renewable projects. More than 50GW of capacity is stranded, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a US-based think-tank, and JMK Research & Analytics, an Indian cleantech research and consulting firm. © Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images “Transmission has become a critical bottleneck . . . causing rising curtailment and commissioning delays in resource-rich states,” says Jyoti Gulia, founder and chief executive of JMK. Earlier this year, Pralhad Joshi, India’s minister for new and renewable energy, hailed a “Historic Green Leap” after the country reached 50 per cent of its [power capacity from renewables](https://www.ft.com/content/a99a5845-9f50-49a3-8c7c-d704b2cf3b95), now totalling 243GW. Even so, Gulia says, grid expansion delays would “lock in higher coal generation”. Nearly three-quarters of India’s power currently comes from coal, which remains central to meeting its growing electricity demand. This is partly due to fragmented planning between state and central authorities, which largely run India’s grid, as well as mismatched build cycles. Renewable projects can be completed in 12 to 18 months, while transmission lines typically take three to five years. Clean power is also predominantly produced in three states: Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, while high demand regions such as Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have little capacity, making cross state delivery critical. “To perfect the timing is impossible,” Ashish Khanna, chief executive of Adani Green Energy — the country’s largest renewable power company — said in September at the Financial Times’ Energy Transition Summit in New Delhi. “You can’t first wait for a grid to come and then build a renewable project.” Those constraints have become the most visible in the northwestern wind and sun-rich state of Rajasthan and development heavy areas there such as Jaisalmer. IEEFA and JMK estimate that 8GW of clean power capacity in the state currently cannot be transmitted. One renewable industry executive in Rajasthan says the “spurt” of green projects, paired with slow grid growth, will probably slow further capacity build out for at least a couple of years. Developers also face obstacles from environmental blockages and grinding [difficulties acquiring contiguous land](https://www.ft.com/content/a8528845-dfe9-4121-a115-c475d0302d3e) in a country with hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers. In parts of Rajasthan and neighbouring Gujarat, a years-long legal ban has prevented new overhead transmission lines from being laid across more than 100,000 sq km to protect the Great Indian Bustard, a [highly endangered and poor-sighted bird](https://www.ft.com/content/cec843fe-804a-43a4-b89a-4f7970c3a6a4) known to fly into power cables. In key areas, smaller players have also exploited those time lags, pre-booking chunks of transmission capacity with no intention of building power plants — driving up premiums to secure connectivity, which they then sell to developers. This delays projects and further burdens genuine operators. Gulia says the bureaucratic need for multi-agency clearances and right-of-way permits that are frequently initiated post-award cause “months to years of delay”. Ideally there should be a single-window regulatory clearance system with strict timelines, she says, as well as performance-based incentives and disincentives. Last year India announced a plan to bolster the power grid and deploy the vast amounts of renewable energy coming online. The expansion is expected to cost Rs9.15tr ($104bn) to allow the transmission of 600GW of green power capacity by 2032. However, India’s Central Electricity Authority agency has acknowledged that public funding will not be sufficient to cover the build-out, which means the private sector is likely to have to step in. Private investment from the likes of Adani and Tata Power is already starting to reshape the sector, Khanna at Adani Green says. About 9 per cent of the grid is operated by corporates. “They are going to bring their own efficiencies to the system,” adds Khanna, “so I am hopeful that in times to come we will have less \\[of a\\] gap.” ### Europe’s Climate Leaders _The FT is compiling its sixth annual list of Europe’s climate leaders.

The situation threatens the nation's clean energy goals. Renewable Powered by - [Bloomberg](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/88675367/Bloomberg) - Published On Nov 10, 2025 at 03:37 PM IST - - Copy Link - Share on WhatsApp - Share on Linkedin - Share on X - Share on Telegram - Share on Facebook Indias power grid faces significant challenges absorbing a surge in solar installations, leading to record curtailment rates.India’s power grid is struggling to absorb a surge in solar power installations, leading to more curtailment that threatens the build-out of renewables and underscores the need for energy storage.The curtailment rate for solar generation in October rose to about 12 per cent, the highest since May when [Grid Controller of India Ltd.](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/grid+controller+of+india+ltd.) started publishing the data. On some days, about 40 per cent of solar power output was denied access to the national network. Curtailments measure how much electricity was generated without finding its way to customers. Advt The data points to a deepening mismatch between supply and demand when solar generation floods the grid during the day time. Coal power plants can’t reduce output fast enough to make room for surging solar output, and the fossil fuel must be kept in operation as it’s needed to meet demand after the sun sets.The month also saw rare curtailments of wind power, the data showed. This highlights the need to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources with storage, like grid-scale batteries, so that excess electricity can be dispatched in the evening.India has about 44-gigawatts worth of green projects that are struggling to find state utilities to buy their electricity. The government is considering canceling projects where prospects of an offtake deal looks minimal, threatening a goal of doubling clean power capacity to 500 gigawatts by the end of the decade. - [Bloomberg](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/88675367/Bloomberg) - Published On Nov 10, 2025 at 03:37 PM IST - - Telegram - Facebook - Copy Link ## Comments What are your thoughts?

    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

General Assembly in New York City on Sept. 22, 2023. (BING GUAN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) A trilateral partnership between the United States, Japan and the Philippines focusing on cyberdefense, joint maritime patrols and supply chain resilience will likely help improve freedom of navigation and economic security in the South China Sea, but it may also raise the risk of trade disputes and conflict with China. U.S. President Joe Biden will host Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a state visit on April 10, followed by a trilateral summit on April 11 where Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will also be present. The trilateral summit between the United States, the Philippines and Japan will be the first of its kind and will focus on three main areas: national security, economic security and mitigating climate change, with an eye toward institutionalizing cooperation via formal dialogue mechanisms in the medium-to-long term. The summit will likely conclude with the issuance of a joint vision statement laying out each country's... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(BIJU BORO/AFP/Getty Images) ## Highlights - _Despite the size and importance of the massive interconnected river system China and India share (along with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh), no integrated structure exists for its management, and the bilateral agreements that govern it are far from sufficient._ - _Political disputes, such as the 2017 standoff over the Doklam Plateau, could harm the waterways China and India share._ - _Unless the countries agree to institute a basinwide mechanism for water management, the river systems they both depend on will be at risk._ Nearly a year after their standoff on the Doklam Plateau began, India and China are trying to get their relationship back on track. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last month in Wuhan with just that goal in mind, and though their summit was more spectacle than substance, it was nonetheless a necessary step toward resolution. The informal meeting gave the two leaders a prime opportunity to lay aside, however briefly, their countries' long-standing differences and focus on topics of mutual concern, such as climate change, food security and natural disasters. Yet one related issue was missing from the agenda: water. If Beijing and New Delhi fail to address the matter, the repercussions for the region, its inhabitants and its environment will likely be devastating....

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

On April 2, the United States announced a new set of tariffs impacting many trading partners, including a 37% tariff on Bangladesh, 30% on Pakistan and 44% on Sri Lanka. While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances.

(MONEY SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) India’s emergence as the world’s largest COVID-19 hotspot more than a year into the pandemic threatens to derail its recovery from last year’s deep recession, setting back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. The government’s desire to avoid nationwide lockdowns and severe economic effects has forced Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rely instead on the problematic strategy of using vaccinations to overcome the pandemic. Growth will be positive, but downside risks to robust forecasts are materializing and an incomplete or delayed government response threatens the outlook and will affect the Modi government’s ability to pursue needed reforms and avoid political unrest....

As anticipated, India found itself on the receiving end, with a 26% tariff slapped on its exports to the United States. The move has raised serious concerns about the future of trade ties between New Delhi and its largest export destination. In a dramatic shift from traditional diplomacy, President Donald Trump announced that the US would impose tariffs equal to half of what other countries charge on American goods. Since India levies a cumulative 52% tariff on US products, the new White House annexure listed a reciprocal 27% tariff on Indian goods. But this is only the beginning. According to a White House fact sheet, a 10% base tariff on all imports will take effect from April 5. From April 9, countries running the highest trade deficits with the US —including India —will face even steeper levies. A total of 185 countries are expected to be impacted. With these moves, the average US tariff rate has now surged to 29% —its highest level in over a century. **READ |[Ayushman Bharat: A grand promise undone by poor execution](https://www.policycircle.org/society/ayushman-bharat-scheme-pmjay/)** ### **Blow to India’s export ambitions** The fallout for India is likely to be significant. The US is one of the few major economies with which India enjoys a trade surplus —$46 billion as of 2024. However, these gains now stand threatened. India had already been in Washington’s crosshairs, featuring in Trump’s infamous Dirty 15 list —countries deemed the worst offenders in terms of trade practices. The sectors expected to be hit hardest include agriculture, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and precious stones. #### Trump effect: Additional US tariffs on India ![policy circle image](https://www.policycircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iift-300x261.jpg)Compiled by Murali Kallummal, Professor, Centre for WTO Studies, IIFT According to a recent study by the Global Trade Research Initiative ([GTRI](https://gtri.co.in/)), the most affected agricultural segments will be fish, meat, and processed seafood —which together accounted for $2.58 billion in exports to the US last year. Notably, America absorbs 40% of India’s total shrimp exports. Higher tariffs will erode competitiveness and shrink market share. India’s gains in electronics could also unravel. The Indian government had worked to position the country as a viable alternative to China under the China+1 strategy, especially in smartphone manufacturing. Finished smartphones currently attract a 16-20% import duty in India, while Indian exports to the US enjoy zero duty. But if US tariffs now apply to Indian phones, the fledgling sector may suffer a blow in its early growth phase, potentially reversing hard-won progress. One silver lining, however, is that India’s IT services —which form a large chunk of exports —are exempt from goods-specific tariffs, at least for now. ### **Navigating a rising trade storm** The pressing question for India’s policymakers is: how to counter mounting trade pressure from Washington without derailing its export-led growth strategy? A crucial step would be to fast-track the ongoing negotiations for a Bilateral Trade Agreement with the US. Talks have been in motion, and both sides have incentives to reach an accord quickly. A successful BTA could offer exemptions or relief from some of the punitive measures. India has already taken pre-emptive steps. In March, New Delhi signed the terms of reference for a BTA following a push from the Prime Minister’s Office. It also lowered duties on select American products —including high-end motorcycles, agricultural goods, and Bourbon whiskey —in its Union Budget, signalling a willingness to negotiate. Still, New Delhi must tread carefully. While India’s tariff levels may appear high, they reflect domestic development goals and the need to protect vulnerable industries. The US prioritises its commercial interests. India too must evaluate each demand against its own national priorities —development, industrialisation, and cultural values. A recent PwC report recommended that Indian businesses build long-term resilience strategies —including diversification of markets and value chain upgrades —to mitigate the impact of US protectionism. ### **Strategic realignments** Amid this backdrop, an intriguing diplomatic overture emerged. On April 2 —coinciding with the US tariff announcement —China and India marked the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic ties. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a message to Indian President Droupadi Murmu, called for a “dragon-elephant tango” to strengthen cooperation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi echoed the sentiment, noting that stronger India-China ties would support a stable, multipolar world. Observers see this as a subtle signal to Washington: major developing economies are willing to explore alternative alliances if pushed too hard. Xi emphasised the need for mutual modernisation between China and India as leading voices of the Global South —perhaps suggesting a pivot away from overreliance on Western markets. ### **The road ahead** The 26% reciprocal tariff may compel India to re-examine its own tariff structures, not just in response to the US, but to remain competitive in global markets. The coming weeks will be critical as New Delhi awaits a formal list of US demands and considers its options. India remains an essential market for US companies across sectors —from tech to pharmaceuticals —and this mutual interdependence offers room for compromise. India’s strategy should be to engage the US in negotiations rather than escalate into a full-blown trade war. As noted in a Bernstein report, India’s measured, diplomatic approach could help it navigate the turbulent waters of trade protectionism, preserving both economic stability and strategic autonomy.
