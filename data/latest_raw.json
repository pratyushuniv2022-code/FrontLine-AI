It continues to be so.”_– Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.\\[i\\] _From Ideology To Warfare_ The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. _Resurgence_ Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. ### A New Strategy _“We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.”_-Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. _Overruns_ On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • **Used improvised explosive devices.** Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • **Assassinated officials.** In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • **Destroyed police infrastructure.** Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj _Systems Disruption_ At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? ### The Deviant Economic Engine _“The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.”_-Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. _The Revolutionary Tax_ In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. _A Revolutionary Tax Economy_ To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • **Mining.** Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • **Narcotics.** India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • **Informal tolls.** Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. ### A Strategic Half-Life _“It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they_ _look to the Naxals for justice.”_–Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future. _Sources:_ i Mahendra Kumawat, “Naxal Movement Has Shown Tremendous Grit,” Rediff News, April 9, 2010. ii Waquar Ahmed, Amitabh Kundu, and Richard Peet, India’s New Economic Policy: A Critical Analysis (New York: Routledge, 2011). iii Bibhudatta Pradhan and Santosh Kumar, “Pillai to End Maoist Grip on $80 Billion Investments,” Bloomberg Businessweek, September 17, 2010. iv Government of India, “Fact Sheet On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),” Ministry of Commerce and Industry, February 11, 2011, http://dipp.nic.in/fdi\\_statistics/india\\_FDI\\_February2011.pdf (accessed March 23, 2011). v Rahul Nilakantan and Saurabh Singhal, “The Economic Costs Of Naxalite Violence and the Economic Benefits of a Unique Robust Security Response,” 2010. http://www.aae.wisc.edu/mwiedc/papers/2011/Singhal\\_Saurabh.pdf (accessed April 3, 2011). vi “Chhattisgarh’s Entire Forest Area A Minefield?,” Times of India, May 10, 2010. vii Manoj Prasad, “Former Jharkhand CM Marandi on Their Hitlist, Naxals Kill Son, 17 More,” Indian Express, October 28, 2007. viii Press Trust of India, “Maoists Storm Jehanabad Jail,” Rediff News, November 14, 2005. ix Sudheer Pal Singh, “Illegal Mining May Impede Divestment in Coal India,” Business Standard, August 21, 2010. x Government of India, “Loss of Coal Production in Naxalite Areas,” Press Information Bureau, August 4, 2010, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=64116 (accessed January 4, 2011). xi “Chronology of Naxal Attacks on Trains,” India Today, May 28, 2010. xii Law Kumar Mishra, “Maoists Blow Up Track on Gaya-Dhanbad Section, Rail Traffic Disrupted,” Times of India, September 13, 2010. xiii “Naxal Attacks Doubled in 2009, Rlys Lost Rs 500cr: Mamata,” Times of India, April 23, 2010. xiv Manoj Prasad, “Naxal Attacks, Escalated Cost Derail Jharkhand Railway Projects,” India Express, April 12, 2010. xv Ishita Ayan Dutt, “Naxal Hits to Pull NMDC Net Down by Rs 1,000 cr,” Business Standard, April 20, 2010. xvi “NMDC to Lay 12 mt Pipeline on Highways to Avoid Naxal Attacks,” The Financial Express, July 20, 2010. xvii “Naxals Obstruct Road Works,” The Hindu, May 9, 2011. xviii Dutt. xix Sandeep Joshi, “550 More Mobile Towers to Boost Fight Against Naxalites,” The Hindu, June 30, 2010. xx “World Bank Approves $1.5 billion for India’s Rural Roads Scheme,” Press Trust of India, December 22, 2010. xxi Prassana Mohanty, “Maoists’ Financing – The Blood Flows as Long as the Cash Flows,” Governance Now, April 7, 2010. xxii Mohanty xxiii Sujeet Kumar, “Maoists extort Rs 300 Crore Annually in Chhattisgarh,” The Economic Times, July 5, 2009. xxiv Bharti Jain, “Rs 150 Crore: Maoists Extortion Amount From Chhattisgarh SSIs,” The EconomicTimes, April 10, 2010. xxv Ajit Kumar Singh and Sachin Bansidhar Diwan, “Red Money,” Outlook India, April 5, 2010. xxvi Ministry of Home Affairs, 2010-2011 Annual Report (Delhi: Government of India, 2011). xxvii Shaikh Azizur Rahman, “India’s Illegal Coal Mines Turn Into Death Pits,” The WashingtonTimes, November 24, 2006. xxviii Prasoon Majumdar, “Our Own Banana Republics!” Indian Institute of Planning andManagement, August 26, 2010, http://prasoonmajumdar.blogspot.com/2010/08/our-own-banana- republics.html (accessed April 29, 2011). xxix United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, “India is a Major Drug Hub: US,” September, 2007, http://www.unodc.org/india/en/rajiv\\_quoted\\_et.html (accessed February 25, 2011).",

It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. Picture source: Depositphotos. _Prospects & Perspectives No. 28_ **The Shadow War: How the Pahalgam Terror Attack Redefined India-China-Pakistan Equation** By _Jagannath Panda_ The Pahalgam [terror attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl) of April 2025, executed by the Pakistan-backed group [The Resistance Front](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473) (TRF), was not merely another episode in the long-running saga of India-Pakistan hostility. It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. By and large, India’s reaction was strong, swift, and assertive beyond the border against the terrorist outfits harbored in Pakistan. The launch of [Operation Sindoor](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473), a precise military response targeting terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC), marked a defining evolution in India’s deterrence doctrine, pointing to a zero-tolerance strategy against terrorism. More than a tactical strike, it was a message — India will respond with resolve, not restraint, when its civilians are attacked. The operation drew clear parallels with the Balakot airstrikes of 2019, yet the context had shifted. The regional climate in 2025 is far more combustible, with trilateral tensions simmering in the Himalayas. The Pahalgam incident has exposed deep-seated fractures in the regional power matrix. China’s strategic posture in the aftermath — marked by conspicuous silence, selective language, and diplomatic hedging — underscores a growing contradiction between its self-styled image as a responsible global power and its operational behavior in South Asia. By refusing to acknowledge the terrorist dimension of such attacks or to pressure its close partner, Pakistan, Beijing reveals a troubling unwillingness to act as a genuine stabilizing force in the region. The contradictions in its stand are only growing and becoming more transparent to the world by the day. Is China truly committed to regional peace and stability, or is it bound by time-worn strategic alignments that prioritize geopolitical advantage over normative responsibility? Can a power that positions itself as an architect of global order afford to undermine its credibility by shielding a state associated with cross-border terrorism? What should be India’s strategic response to this shadow war? **Beijing’s Balancing Act: Neutrality or Strategic Collusion?** Following India’s retaliation, the world watched closely for diplomatic fallout. China’s response was a masterclass in studied ambiguity. Beijing termed India’s military action “ [regrettable](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202505/t20250507_11616523.html)” while conspicuously omitting any condemnation of the terror attack itself. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made [no mention](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/lxjzh/202505/t20250509_11618305.html) of the victims in Pahalgam, nor TRF’s Pakistani connections. Instead, Beijing’s focus remained firmly on urging “restraint” and “dialogue,” echoing a playbook that has often shielded Islamabad from international censure. This is not entirely a new behavior on the part of the Chinese leadership. Beijing has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the UN Security Council to [block designations of known terrorists](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slams-china-at-un-for-blocking-move-to-designate-2611-accused-sajid-mir-as-global-terrorist/article66993043.ece) based in Pakistan, including Sajid Mir, a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander involved in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008. This pattern of diplomatic protection underscores China’s strategic calculus: Pakistan is more than an ally — it is a linchpin in Beijing’s South Asia strategy and a buffer against Indian regional ascendency. What makes China’s stance especially problematic is its persistent refusal to differentiate between India’s counterterrorism actions and aggressive behavior. Chinese state media and official discourse frequently conflate Indian responses along the LoC with assertive conduct along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), crafting a narrative in which India is portrayed as a regional aggressor. This distortion allows Beijing to simultaneously align with Pakistan’s security outlook while maintaining a superficial neutrality. Moreover, China’s behavior mirrors its broader geopolitical approach: internal threats such as “Uyghur separatism” are met with uncompromising state violence, while external threats that affect neighbors like India are compartmentalized or ignored. The selective outrage is a window into Beijing’s dual standards on terrorism and state sovereignty. **Proxy Wars and Silent Partners: Redrawing the Diplomatic Map** Beyond the rhetoric, Beijing’s alignment with Pakistan is rooted in hard interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the crown jewel of Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This infrastructure project is not just about roads and pipelines — it’s about strategic depth. Any Indian challenge to the territorial status quo threatens both Pakistan’s and China’s investments, thereby sealing the logic of Beijing’s indirect complicity. This complicity extends into the diplomatic arena. In multilateral forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China has consistently [blocked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/human-rights-must-be-respected-india-after-skipping-xinjiang-vote/articleshow/94713915.cms) Indian attempts to highlight Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism. Instead, China promotes counterterrorism frameworks that align neatly with its own domestic narratives, especially those concerning Xinjiang, while conveniently avoiding issues that implicate Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues its [strategic silence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/22/asia/imran-khan-xinjiang-axios-intl-hnk) on China’s repression of Uyghur Muslims, despite its self-styled image as a champion of the Islamic world. This tacit exchange of blind spots — on terrorism and human rights — has become the bedrock of the Sino-Pakistani axis. And India, despite walking a tightrope on sensitive Chinese issues like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, has received no reciprocation in the form of diplomatic neutrality or support. The geopolitical geometry is clear: while India and Pakistan battle over borders and ideology, China plays the dual role of facilitator and firewall for Islamabad. Whether in backchannel diplomacy or in global institutions, China consistently acts to dilute pressure on Pakistan, reinforcing a strategic triangle that disadvantages New Delhi at every turn. Beijing’s deliberate omission of Pakistani provocations and cross-border violence in its Operation Sindoor response press briefings suggests a calculated strategic posture. This silence reflects China’s continued alignment with Pakistan, indicating that broader geopolitical considerations outweigh any immediate concerns about regional instability. By not publicly addressing Islamabad’s role, China signals its intent to preserve and prioritize its long-standing strategic partnership with Pakistan. **A Call for India’s Strategic Realignment** In this increasingly tangled web of interests, India must reassess its China doctrine. The idea of Beijing as a potential stabilizer in South Asia has little basis in reality. Instead, China has shown a consistent willingness to prioritize its strategic partnerships and investments over regional peace or normative alignment against terrorism. One avenue for India is to adopt a strategy of normative reciprocity. If China insists on referring to Jammu and Kashmir as a “disputed territory,” India could begin more openly addressing Chinese sensitive issues, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and potentially even Taiwan, revisiting its “One China” policy. Until now, India has largely upheld a principle of “mutual sensitivity” regarding core sovereignty concerns. While China has been increasingly assertive in internationalizing the Kashmir issue — whether through UN Security Council interventions, statements aligning with Pakistan, or selective cartographic provocations — India has avoided reciprocal commentary on China’s sensitive regions. This asymmetric restraint has allowed China to shape narratives unchallenged, while denying India the same deference on issues central to its national unity. Engaging Taiwan more openly — especially on trade, technology, and democratic solidarity — aligns India with other democracies like the U.S., Japan, and parts of Europe that have gradually normalized unofficial ties. Strengthening ties with Taiwan also offers India access to high-end manufacturing, especially in semiconductors, where Taiwan’s TSMC dominates global supply chains, critical for India’s tech and defense sectors. A closer India-Taiwan dynamic could be used as part of a broader Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance Chinese assertiveness in the region, especially when coupled with defense dialogues like the Quad. Explicit moves on Taiwan would likely provoke strong diplomatic and possibly economic retaliation from Beijing. This could take the form of border pressure along the LAC, trade restrictions, or cyber disruptions. Any move on Taiwan would have more impact if coordinated with partners like the U.S., Japan, or Australia. A unilateral shift may yield limited strategic gain while exposing India to disproportionate costs. It is therefore imperative that India must continue to invest more robustly in multilateral and minilateral coalitions that exclude or counterbalance China, such as the Quad, the India-Japan-Australia trilateral, and enhanced EU engagements. India’s aspiration to be recognized as a major international power, including in the “Global South,” depends not solely on its material capabilities but also on its normative influence, particularly in shaping global discourses on terrorism. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, New Delhi may need to recalibrate its approach by intensifying collaboration with global norm entrepreneurs, including middle powers across Europe and Asia, as well as transnational civil society and multilateral institutions. Moreover, India’s leadership roles in forums such as the G20 and BRICS present strategic platforms through which it can reframe regional security narratives and assert its vision for counterterrorism norms. Domestically, India must prepare for the long haul. The possibility of a coordinated two-front scenario — with Pakistan engaging in asymmetric warfare through proxy actors and irregular tactics and China providing strategic and diplomatic cover — is no longer hypothetical. Preparing for this evolving threat environment requires India to adopt a comprehensive and long-term security posture, encompassing military modernization, institutional resilience, and societal preparedness. Enhancing border infrastructure, upgrading intelligence and surveillance capabilities, and fortifying strategic deterrence must be non-negotiables in India’s defense roadmap. Sustaining a prolonged state of readiness requires a resilient defense-industrial base, robust supply chains, and financial planning. India must continue reforms to reduce dependence on foreign arms imports, incentivize indigenous R&D, and create strategic reserves for critical materials. Further, building robust logistical networks, especially in border states and high-altitude regions, will improve troop mobility and sustain long-term deployments. Civil-military synergy in infrastructure projects such as roads, airfields, and telecommunications along both western and eastern frontiers is essential. The shifting threat landscape demands that India move beyond reactive postures. Both Pakistan and China are adept at leveraging information warfare and disinformation to influence public opinion and sow discord. India must invest in counter-disinformation capacities, strategic communication, and public awareness campaigns to build regional and societal resilience against foreign psychological operations, where Taiwan could emerge as a stronger partner. New Delhi must significantly enhance its capabilities in narrative warfare — a strategic effort to shape perceptions, control the discourse, and influence international opinion. This involves not only countering adversarial narratives but also proactively framing its own story in a manner that resonates with global audiences. India’s case against Pakistan-based terrorism, as well as China’s tacit support through diplomatic silence or selective framing, must be articulated with clarity, credibility, and moral authority. To be effective, this narrative must be disseminated across multiple global platforms — from the United Nations and international media to think tanks, academic forums, and digital diplomacy channels — to expose the regional destabilizing roles of both Pakistan and China, and to align international sentiment with India’s security concerns and normative positions. The decision to send [delegations](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seven-all-party-delegations-to-take-indias-message-against-terrorism-to-key-partner-nations-government/article69586448.ece) to 32 nations is a strong first step. Publishing credible evidence, such as satellite imagery, financial trail disclosures, or intercepted communications, can further strengthen the factual basis of India’s narrative and pre-empt counterclaims. **Conclusion: Pahalgam as a Turning Point** The Pahalgam terrorist attack will be remembered not just for its human toll, but for what it revealed about the shifting tectonics of regional power complexities. It was a moment of clarity: India is not just facing a belligerent neighbor in Pakistan, but also contending with a cunning and double-standard power in China that is willing to obscure terrorism behind the veil of strategic self-interest. Increasingly, China’s actions — or calculated inactions — are rendering its strategic contradictions more visible to the international community, challenging the coherence of its South Asia policy and weakening its claim to impartiality in regional conflict resolution. The path ahead for India requires more than conventional military readiness; it calls for a fundamental reassessment of the strategic assumptions underpinning India's approach to China, particularly regarding Beijing’s role in shaping, enabling, or deferring regional crises. New Delhi’s challenge is two-fold. It must deter asymmetric threats from across the border, and it must decode and counteract the quieter, more insidious enablers of that threat. That means not just stronger borders, but sharper diplomacy. Not just better arms, but better arguments. Narrative warfare, if conducted strategically, allows India not just to defend its position but to shape the global agenda on terrorism and regional order, reinforcing its claim to normative leadership as a rising power. Pahalgam may have been a tragedy for India, but it is also an inflection point. A new foreign policy realism must follow. Because in this geopolitical theatre, the shadows are as dangerous as the swords.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://www.wired.com/www.wired.com#main-content) Save this story Save this story For almost three weeks, the production lines at [global car giant Jaguar Land Rover](https://www.wired.com/story/jlr-jaguar-land-rover-electric-vehicle-factory-halewood/) have stood still. Usually busy turning out an estimated 1,000 vehicles per day, staff at multiple JLR factories across Britain have been told to stay at home as the automotive firm responds to a damaging cyberattack. But as its recovery has stretched from days to weeks, the knock-on impacts are being felt at the hundreds of companies that supply JLR with parts and materials and risk turning the attack into a full-blown crisis. On Friday, the UK government [admitted](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-on-government-industry-supplier-meeting-regarding-jaguar-land-rover-cyber-incident) that the cyberattack against JLR was having a “significant impact” on the company and on the “wider automotive supply chain.” The concession came as unions and officials have increasingly warned that [thousands](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyrqxj3eqqo) of jobs in JLR’s sprawling supply chain could be lost, and some smaller companies could go bankrupt. Reports claim JLR itself may be [losing up to £50 million ($67 million) per week](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c784nwvj1l3o) in the shutdown. Some firms have reportedly already laid off staff, with the [Unite union claiming](https://www.unitetheunion.org/news-events/news/2025/september/jlr-supply-chain-workers-being-told-to-apply-for-universal-credit-in-wake-of-cyberattack) that workers in the JLR supply chain “are being laid off with reduced or zero pay.” Some have been told to “sign up” for government benefits, the union claims. “It seems unprecedented in the UK to have that level of disruption because of a cyberattack or ransomware attack,” says [Jamie MacColl](https://www.rusi.org/people/maccoll), a senior research fellow in the cyber and tech research group at the security and defence think tank RUSI. That thousands of jobs could be put at risk, either temporarily or permanently, is “a different order of magnitude” to previous incidents, MacColl says. JLR, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, is one of the UK’s biggest employers, with around 32,800 people directly employed in the country. Stats on the company’s [website](https://www.jlr.com/uk-impact-report) also claim it supports another 104,000 jobs through its UK supply chain and another 62,900 jobs “through wage-induced spending.” Many other suppliers are also based outside of the UK, as well as some overseas factories. At the start of September, JLR [confirmed](https://media.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2025/09/statement-cyber-incident) it had been “impacted” by a cyberattack and that the company was taking “immediate action” and “proactively shutting down our systems,” effectively grinding its factories and production processes to a halt. As the company investigated the attack, it [revealed](https://media.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2025/09/statement-cyber-incident-1) that “some data” has been “affected” but did not specify what that data is. Despite efforts to get systems back online, the company confirmed on Wednesday that its “pause” in production has been [extended](https://media.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2025/09/statement-cyber-incident-2) to Wednesday, September 24. “We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time,” JLR said in a statement on Wednesday. “We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.” JLR did not respond to questions from WIRED about what systems were disrupted, the financial cost of the cyberattack to suppliers, nor any measures the company was looking at to support businesses. Almost immediately after the cyberattack, a group on Telegram called Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, [claimed responsibility](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gqepe5355o) for the hack. The group name implies a potential collaboration between three loose hacking collectives— [Scattered Spider](https://www.wired.com/story/scattered-spider-most-imminent-threat/), [Lapsus$](https://www.wired.com/story/lapsusdollar-uber-rockstar-breach-multifactor-authentication-weaknesses/), and [Shiny Hunters](https://www.wired.com/story/shinyhunters-hacking-group-data-breach-spree/)—that have been behind some of the most high-profile cyberattacks in recent years. They are often made up of [young, English-speaking, cybercriminals who target major businesses](https://www.wired.com/story/scattered-spider-most-imminent-threat/). Building vehicles is a hugely complex process. Hundreds of different companies provide parts, materials, electronics, and more to vehicle manufacturers, and these expansive supply chain networks [often rely](https://www.projectmanagementoffice.org.uk/automotive/driving-transformation-at-jaguar-land-rover/) [upon](https://mag.toyota.co.uk/just-in-time/) “just-in-time” manufacturing. That means they order parts and services to be delivered in the specific quantities that are needed and exactly when they need them—large stockpiles of parts are unlikely to be held by auto makers. “The supplier networks that are supplying into these manufacturing plants, they’re all set up for efficiency—economic efficiency, and also logistic efficiency,” says [Siraj Ahmed Shaikh](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/s.a.shaikh/), a professor in systems security at Swansea University. “There’s a very carefully orchestrated supply chain,” Shaikh adds, speaking about automotive manufacturing generally. “There’s a critical dependency for those suppliers supplying into this kind of an operation. As soon as there is a disruption at this kind of facility, then all the suppliers get affected.” One company that makes glass sun roofs has started laying off workers, according to a report in the [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/18/jaguar-land-rover-supplier-puts-jobs-at-risk-cyber-hack/). Meanwhile, another firm told the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdjn0lv64ro) it has laid off around 40 people so far. French automotive company [OPmobility](https://www.opmobility.com/en/), which employs 38,000 people across 150 sites, told WIRED it is making some changes and monitoring the events. “OPmobility is reconfiguring its production at certain sites as a consequence of the shutdown of its production by one of its customers based in the United Kingdom and depending on the evolution of the situation,” a spokesperson for the firm says. While it is unclear which specific JLR systems have been impacted by the hackers and what systems JLR took offline proactively, many were likely taken offline to stop the attack from getting worse. “It’s very challenging to ensure containment while you still have connections between various systems,” says [Orla Cox](https://fticommunications.com/fti-consulting-expands-cybersecurity-data-privacy-communications-practice-in-emea-with-appointment-of-orla-cox/), head of EMEA cybersecurity communications at FTI Consulting, which responds to cyberattacks and works on investigations. “Oftentimes as well, there will be dependencies on different systems: You take one down, then it means that it has a knock on effect on another.” Whenever there’s a hack in any part of a supply chain—whether that is a manufacturer at the top of the pyramid or a firm further down the pipeline—digital connections between companies may be severed to stop attackers from spreading from one network to the next. Connections via VPNs or APIs may be stopped, Cox says. “Some may even take stronger measures such as blocking domains and IP addresses. Then things like email are no longer usable between the two organizations.” The complexity of digital and physical supply chains, spanning across dozens of businesses and just-in-time production systems, means it is likely that bringing everything back online and up to full-working speed may take time. MacColl, the RUSI researcher, says cybersecurity issues often fail to be debated at the highest level of British politics—but adds this time could be different due to the scale of the disruption. “This incident has the potential to cut through because of the job losses and the fact that MPs in constituencies affected by this will be getting calls,” he says. That breakthrough has already begun. “This cyberattack is not some mere flicker on a screen, it is fast becoming a cyber-shockwave ripping through our industrial heartlands,” Liam Byrne, a member of Parliament and chair of the House of Commons’ Business and Trade committee [said](https://x.com/liambyrnemp/status/1968240209859842175) on X. “If government stands back, that shockwave is going to destroy jobs, businesses, and pay packets across Britain.” Other lawmakers have also [expressed concerns](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/emergency-intervention-plea-birmingham-jlr-32495851) after speaking with impacted JLR suppliers, and the Unite union has said the British government should intervene with a [“furlough” scheme to support workers](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/15/covidstyle_furlough_schemes_for_jlr/). “The recent cyber incident is having a significant impact on Jaguar Land Rover and on the wider automotive supply chain,” the UK’s Department for Business and Trade [said in a statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-on-government-industry-supplier-meeting-regarding-jaguar-land-rover-cyber-incident) on Friday, following a meeting with automotive industry groups. “The Government, including government cyber experts, are in contact with the company to support the task of restoring production operations, and are working closely with JLR to understand any impacts on the supply chain.” The attack is likely [another incident](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/) that demonstrates how fragile supply chains can be when they are faced with disruption. “We do need to shift to a more resilient supply chain and a resilient operation when it comes to things like manufacturing,” says Shaikh, from Swansea University. Meanwhile, MacColl says that as global tensions are high—with multiple countries taking steps to make sure they [are prepared](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/09/09/europe-war-footing-russia-ukraine-nato-defence-putin/) [for war](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpqnlxr43zdo)—the attack indicates how production can be forced to grind to a halt. “If this is the effect just that criminals can have on our supply chains, then it's quite worrying to think about how unprepared we are for, say, a more coordinated and sustained attack from a potential state adversary,” MacColl says. ## You Might Also Like … - **In your inbox:** Our [biggest stories](https://www.wired.com/newsletter/daily?sourceCode=BottomStories), handpicked for you each day - Meet the guys betting big on [AI gambling agents](https://www.wired.com/story/sports-betting-crypto-artificial-intelligence-agents/) - **Big Story:** The baby died.

    "full_text": "[0](https://www.swiftcentre.org/cart) # Could a winter blackout freeze the UK’s Financial Services? 11 Sept Written By [Eleanor Parr](https://www.swiftcentre.org/publicforecasts?author=642ac8893fc789184d0192dc) Illustration by [James Daw](https://www.instagram.com/jamesdaw_illustration/?hl=en) #### This article is also published on [CapX](https://capx.co/britain-isnt-ready-for-the-coming-blackouts) Loading the [Elevenlabs Text to Speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) AudioNative Player... ## **Key takeaways** - A UK blackout lasting more than 24 hours before 2026 was estimated at 7.8% – a non-negligible risk with serious consequences for financial services - The likelihood rises significantly in a severe winter, when cold, storms, and tight gas supplies could push the probability to 14.8%. - If such a blackout occurs, forecasters see better than even odds that at least 100,000 people would lose access to their bank accounts, with cascading failures across ATMs, payments, and telecoms. In April, a widespread [power outage in Spain](https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/blackout/28-april-2025-iberian-blackout/) showed how quickly a nation’s energy infrastructure can be stressed. If a similar outage were to occur in the UK and stretch beyond 24 hours, the effects would escalate from inconvenience to systemic risk for financial services: payment flows could seize up, trading could be disrupted, and millions could lose access to banking services. For a sector built on real-time settlement and continuous connectivity, this is a severe but plausible scenario that deserves active monitoring. These vulnerabilities are amplified by mounting pressures on the UK’s power system. Electricity demand is climbing, driven in part by the growth of data centres, the electrification of transport and heating. Much of the grid infrastructure is aging, with uneven investment in upgrades. Winter peaks are increasingly shaped by extreme weather, and longer spells of low wind or sun can tighten operating margins just as demand surges. Findings Against this backdrop, the Swift Centre Forecasters were asked: **_Will the UK experience an electricity blackout lasting over 24 hours before December 31st 2026 that severely disrupts financial services?_** ## **Findings** On average, the Swift Centre forecasters put the probability of the UK experiencing a blackout lasting more than 24 hours before the end of 2026 at 7.8%. This means roughly a one-in-twelve chance of a systemic disruption to the UK’s financial services within the next two years. And this figure only covers the most severe case – outages lasting more than 24 hours. Shorter blackouts, which can still disrupt payments and trading, are supposedly more plausible. Behind this headline number, views diverged. A group clustered at the higher end, around 17-18%, emphasising severe weather and infrastructure fragility. Others leaned much lower (0.5-5%), pointing to the historical rarity of such long outages and the grid’s proven resilience. The gap reflects different judgments about what could plausibly drive a multi-day blackout, as well as competing views on the UK’s ability to withstand shocks. Those on the lower end argued that blackouts lasting more than 24 hours are historically rare in the UK and that the grid has generally proven resilient. One noted: “ _We have events that can be considered ‘major’ UK blackouts… However, few if any lasted longer than 12 hours_.” Another gave a 2% estimate but said this would rise to 5-10% if shorter outages were considered. In their view, the most plausible drivers of a multi-day blackout would be supply shortages rather than extreme weather. While storms and floods regularly cause localised outages, these are usually resolved in under 24 hours. By contrast, past rolling blackouts were linked to fuel constraints, and the UK’s relatively small gas storage capacity still represents a vulnerability: > “ _We currently store 12 days’ worth of winter gas demand, compared with 89 days in Germany and 103 days in France._” Even so, they judged that interconnectors to Europe and imports from the U.S. and Middle East make outright shortages unlikely in the forecast period. Cyberattacks were also downplayed as a plausible trigger. The grid remains relatively isolated from the internet, and past incidents (such as the [2019 lightning strike](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d96100340f0b61743bd4cc3/20191003_E3C_Interim_Report_into_GB_Power_Disruption.pdf)) have been rapidly contained: > “A _long, nationwide blackout won’t occur, in spite of the Grid’s finer supply and response time margins._” Others in the low-probability camp nudged their estimates slightly higher (up to 5%), emphasising recent close calls and the challenges of managing a system with more variable renewables. One observed that “ _risk is higher than in the past with increased share of volatile renewables._” Another pointed to the [near-blackout in January 2025](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/09/britain-came-within-whisker-blackouts-national-grid/): “ _Such close calls do make one wonder if the system is sufficiently resilient. But at the same time, that the situation at worst would have resulted in planned blackouts of about three hours._” By contrast, those at the higher end placed more weight on weather and infrastructure fragility. One reasoned that “ _blackouts in the UK are not particularly frequent and almost all of them \\[…\\] are related to severe weather,_” and identified 3-6 instances in the past three decades where outages lasted over 24 hours, leading them to a double digit estimate. Another highlighted specific cases – the [2013 Christmas storms](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7c5576e5274a1b0042311a/DECC_-_Festive_disruption_review_-_Final__2_.pdf), [2015 floods](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-35020049), and storms [Arwen (2021)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/storm-arwen-electricity-distribution-disruption-review) and [Eunice (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Eunice#:~:text=The%20UK%20was%20particularly%20hard,km%2Fh)%20were%20recorded.) – and concluded that “ _large towns going out for more than 24 hours is quite common._” A third, giving a 17% probability, focused on infrastructure risk, pointing to [Heathrow’s 18-hour outage in 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-into-the-north-hyde-substation-outage-terms-of-reference) as a sign of weak redundancy: > “ _The recent shutdown of Heathrow due to a substation fire showed a weakness in ability to quickly shift to alternative sources._” They also added a small premium for cyberattacks, accounting for around 1.5% of their estimate. ## **If Winter Bites Harder** Forecasters were also asked to assess how their probabilities would change in the event of a severe winter in 2025 or 2026. In this scenario, severe winter was defined as record-low temperatures, low renewable generation, tight gas supplies, or extreme storms. Across the board, forecasters agreed that harsh winter conditions would make a long blackout more likely. Most described the effect as roughly doubling their baseline estimate, though the results varied widely depending on where they had started from. Justifications also differed: some emphasised the compounded stress on gas and renewables, others the physical damage caused by storms, and a few highlighted the risk of global energy supply constraints. For some, the increase was modest in absolute terms. One forecaster, for example, raised their probability from 2% to 4%, explaining: > “ _Even given a severe winter, I think the probability is very low as long as parts of the large town or region have power restored in under 24 hours, so I'm increasing my estimate by only two percentage points._” Another echoed this view, stressing that “ _Individual weather events like blizzards can cause blackouts without mounting to an extreme winter, so I go with a moderate increase._” Others arrived at higher final estimates. One calculated that roughly “ _47% of years with a major outage… would have resolved positively_” under the severe winter condition, leading them to double their baseline estimate to 40%. Another, who considered the combined risks of high winds, low temperature, major snow or ice storm, argued that resilience would be lower in such circumstances: > “ _Even the loss of a couple of power stations would be a major concern to the UK’s power grid._” They concluded that the probability would be about double their baseline, at 9.8%. Several forecasters pointed to infrastructure fragility and gas reliance as the key vulnerabilities exposed by severe winter conditions. One noted: > “ _The UK increasingly relies on natural gas and renewables. Given such reliance, a period of extreme cold along with low winds could \\[cause\\] selective power outages_.” Another cited National Energy System Operator projections showing “ _the strongest electricity operational margins for the UK grid since 2019,_” but still allowed for the possibility that an unusually cold winter could coincide with global demand pressures and LNG import shortages, settling on a 20% estimate. A final forecaster placed their probability at 25%, reasoning that while severe weather is rare in the UK, it can be very difficult to repair quickly when it does occur: > “ _Ice storms are very rare in the UK, but if they occur, can be devastating to power lines and time-consuming to repair. … I expect that loss of power to a medium-sized city for 24 hours is a relatively low bar and would be difficult to solve without repairs of numerous transmission lines._” ## **Knock-On Effects on Banking Services** Forecasters were also asked to estimate the likelihood that such a blackout would prevent at least 100,000 people in the UK from accessing their bank accounts before 2027. All forecasters judged this outcome to be plausible, with estimates ranging from 30% to 75% and averaging 58%. That implies better than even odds that a major blackout would leave more than 100,000 people unable to access their bank accounts. While confidence levels varied, the consensus was clear: a prolonged outage would almost certainly disrupt financial services on a large scale. At the top end, one forecaster assigned a 75% probability, arguing that the scale of disruption in a 24-hour+ blackout would inevitably capture this many people. Others supported this view with slightly lower estimates. One (62%) explained: > “ _If it lasts for more than 24 hours, it’s likely a nationwide blackout… This very likely means that more than 100,000 people would be unable to access their bank accounts or make payments for at least 12 hours._” Another (63%) stressed that “ _branches and ATMs would naturally be down… The last break point could be the one that matters the most, since an increasing number of people rely on the internet to bank._” Several other forecasters converging around the 50-60% range, emphasised that mundane banking services would fail under these conditions. One wrote: > “ _Should a blackout happen, just about everyone affected by a blackout will lose online access to bank accounts. The main banks may function OK for some time but \\[the\\] majority of the cashpoints will be down. And of course 99% of stores of all kinds will not be able to receive card payments._” Another added that “ _even for those with access to banking by phone app and laptop, cell tower operation, internet service, and the ability to recharge devices are likely to put the number over 100,000._” The only forecaster at the lower end (30%) argued that the internet is not always disabled during power outages, and that people might continue using phones and other battery-operated devices, limiting the number directly affected. Despite these differences, the consensus was clear: once a 24-hours blackout occurs, cascading failures across ATMs, payment systems, telecommunications, and local infrastructure make it highly likely that at least 100,000 people will lose access to their bank accounts. ## **Conclusion** Forecasters judged a multi-day UK blackout to be relatively unlikely – in the single digits under normal conditions – yet the aggregated estimate of 7.8% (with highs of 18%) is still concerning. For a risk that could paralyse payments, trading, and customer access to banking services, even single-digit probabilities amount to a material threat. The risk also rises further under severe winter conditions, with several forecasters effectively doubling their baseline estimates in that scenario. And the consensus was clear: if such a blackout were to occur, the impact on the financial system would be severe.

America’s power grid is straining under the weight of a fast-changing energy landscape. Beyond the usual summer hum of air conditioners, power demand is surging from electric vehicle chargers and sprawling new data centers. At the same time, the infrastructure built to deliver reliable electricity is aging and showing its limits. From Texas heatwaves to California blackouts, the warning signs are impossible to ignore. This isn’t a technical challenge—it’s an economic and political reckoning. If the grid fails, it won’t be because we lacked solutions. It will be because we didn’t act quickly enough. ## **A Demand Surge Few Anticipated** For nearly two decades, U.S. electricity demand was flat. Now, consumption is climbing, driven by technologies that arrived faster than planners expected. Artificial intelligence has unleashed a wave of data center construction. These facilities, dense with high-performance servers and cooling systems, are among the most power-hungry assets in the country. In 2023, AI data centers consumed about [4.4% of U.S. electricity](https://iee.psu.edu/news/blog/why-ai-uses-so-much-energy-and-what-we-can-do-about-it), and that share could triple by 2028, according to Penn State’s Institute of Energy and the Environment. Northern Virginia—“Data Center Alley”— [now handles 70% of global internet traffic](https://oxfordamerican.org/oa-now/how-data-center-alley-is-changing-northern-virginia), pushing utilities like Dominion Energy to scramble for capacity. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google warn that a shortage of skilled electricians could delay expansion, with estimates that the U.S. will need [500,000 more electricians](https://www.ciphernews.com/hot-take/500000-electricians/) in the next decade. Electric vehicles, heat pumps, and electrified industry are adding further strain. The Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee projects growth [equivalent to seven Seattle-sized cities](https://www.nwcouncil.org/fs/18720/2024_05_3.pdf) within ten years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. electricity sales to rise from [4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/elec_coal_renew.php), with similar gains to follow. And finally, there’s climate. As extreme heat events multiply, cooling demand in places like Texas and Arizona is surging—driving peak loads to new records. ## **The Supply Gap: Retirements Outpace Replacement** Just as demand is accelerating, the U.S. is retiring some of its most dependable sources of power. [The EIA projects](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64604) 12.3 gigawatts (GW) of capacity will retire in 2025, a 65% jump over 2024. That includes 8.1 GW of coal, such as the 1,800-MW Intermountain Power Project in Utah, plus another 2.6 GW of natural gas. These plants provide round-the-clock power that intermittent sources cannot yet replace. Wind and solar capacity continue to grow, but not fast enough. The Department of Energy’s July 2025 [Resource Adequacy Report](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/DOE%20Final%20EO%20Report%20%28FINAL%20JULY%207%29_0.pdf) warns that only 22 GW of firm generation is expected by 2030—well short of the 104 GW needed for peak demand. Transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays, and slow adoption of long-duration storage compound the problem. Grid operators from PJM, MISO, ERCOT, and others [told Congress bluntly](https://www.powermag.com/nations-power-operators-warn-congress-of-a-coming-reliability-shortfall/) in March 2025: “Demand is accelerating, supply is lagging, and current tools may not be enough to bridge the gap.” ## **Growing Vulnerabilities: Weather, Cyber, and Sabotage** Beyond the supply-demand imbalance, the grid faces mounting risks. Heatwaves, wildfires, and storms are stressing transmission systems nationwide. Events once considered rare—like the 2003 Northeast blackout that hit 50 million people—are now seen as precursors of larger disruptions. As smart grids and distributed resources proliferate, so do digital entry points for hackers. In 2024, [DOE funded 16 cybersecurity projects](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/department-energy-awards-42-million-guard-power-grid-cyber-threats), including Georgia Tech’s AI-based “DerGuard” system to monitor risks in distributed energy. Sabotage at substations and transmission lines is also rising. With more than 160,000 miles of high-voltage lines and 7,300 plants, much of it decades old, the system is a sprawling, exposed target. [Homeland Security now classifies grid protection](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors) alongside nuclear and water infrastructure. ## **Policy Gridlock and Infrastructure Delays** Despite the alarms, policy responses remain sluggish. Jurisdiction is a big part of the problem. Regional transmission operators manage the grid but don’t own generation or lines. Utilities do, while states control siting and permitting. The result is a patchwork that slows progress. As of mid-2024, transmission projects across the U.S. [faced delays](https://www.wapa.gov/supply-chains/) of five to seven years due to permitting hurdles, interconnection bottlenecks, and supply chain constraints. By mid-2025, lead times for large power transformers had stretched beyond 30 months, with some units requiring up to four years for delivery—posing serious risks to grid reliability and expansion. Even bipartisan efforts like the [CIRCUIT Act](https://www.maddox.com/resources/articles/circuit-act)—introduced in February 2025 to incentivize domestic transformer production through a 10% tax credit—remain stalled in committee, despite widespread industry support and urgent supply chain concerns. Meanwhile, subsidies continue to favor intermittent renewables over firm capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act accelerated clean energy deployment, but without parallel investment in balancing technologies, reliability risks grow. ## **What’s Being Done** Federal and private efforts are ramping up, though often as short-term fixes. DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants and issued reliability directives under the Federal Power Act. These measures keep the lights on but do little to build long-term resilience. DOE also aims to increase long-distance capacity 16% by 2030, adding 7,500 miles of new lines. But permitting delays and local resistance remain obstacles. In 2025, [DOE launched $32 million](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/01/15/us-doe-invests-32-million-for-grid-edge-technology-and-smart-charge-management/) in pilot projects for smart EV charging, responsive buildings, and distributed energy integration. These solutions could eventually scale, but utilities and regulators must buy in. ## **Investor Implications: Reliability as a Premium** For investors, grid instability is a risk, but also an opportunity. Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion, and Avangrid are investing billions in grid modernization and diversified generation. Avangrid alone plans $20 billion through 2030 across 23 states. Independent power producers are also benefiting from the shifting landscape. NRG Energy, one of the nation’s largest competitive power suppliers, has seen its shares climb sharply as rising demand boosts wholesale electricity prices. Unlike regulated utilities, NRG and its peers compete in deregulated markets, where higher load growth and tighter capacity directly translate into stronger margins. That dynamic could make competitive generators an overlooked winner in a strained grid environment. Firms like Fluence, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are seeing growing demand for storage and microgrid solutions. Pilot programs backed by DOE may open new markets for software-driven load management. With coal exiting and renewables constrained, power generated by nuclear energy and natural gas retain a “reliability premium.” [Deloitte estimates](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/power-and-utilities/funding-growth-in-us-power-sector.html) the U.S. power sector will need $1.4 trillion in new capital between 2025 and 2030, with similar levels required through 2050. Firms able to supply firm generation or grid services stand to benefit. ## **Conclusion: Crisis or Course Correction?** The U.S. power grid isn’t collapsing—but it is under pressure like never before. Demand growth, baseload retirements, extreme weather, and policy paralysis are colliding to create a fragile system. Whether this moment becomes a crisis or a correction depends on how quickly policymakers, utilities, and investors adapt. The tools exist—firm generation, smart load management, and modern transmission. But without faster coordination and realistic incentives, the U.S. risks trading energy abundance for energy fragility.

File Photo by John Angelillo/UPI \\| [License Photo](https://www.upi.com/News_Photos/lp/84ed3ffbd831e1a6d5555b511d24f51b/) Sept. 23 (UPI) -- Jaguar Land Rover said its shutdown of production after a cyberattack in late August would continue until at least Oct. 1. The attack targeted the company's [retail and production operations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/business/jaguar-land-rover-cyberattack-production.html#:~:text=which%20targeted%20the%20company%E2%80%99s%20retail%20and%20production). It was one of several cyber- and ransomware attacks that have recently hit many European organizations, including hospitals, charities and airports in Brussels, Berlin, Dublin and London. Marks & Spencer, one of Britain's largest retailers, was hit in April by a cyberattack that the company said would cost it about $405 million in lost profits this year. Jaguar Land Rover has been unable to produce cars since the attack at the end of August forced it to shut down its IT networks. ### Related - [Mexico will raise tariffs to protect strategic industries](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2025/09/16/Mexico-will-raise-tariffs-to-protect-strategic-industries/1231757983078/) - [Auto worker's lost wallet found under hood 11 years later](https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2025/08/15/Michigan-Ford-plant-worker-wallet-lost-Edge-Minnesota-shop/8951755280336/) - [LAX launches biometric identification for travelers](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/08/14/biometric-identification-at-LAX/1881755210061/) - [Ford to build new EV truck at Louisville, Ky., plant, invest $2B](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/08/11/ford-build-new-ev-truck-Louisville-kentucky-plant-invest-2b/5801754932232/) \"Our focus remains on supporting our customers, suppliers, colleagues, and our retailers who remain open,\" JLR [said in a statement](https://www.jlr.com/). \"We fully recognize this is a difficult time for all connected with JLR, and we thank everyone for their continued support and patience.\" JLR had initially told employees, suppliers and partners that its production pause would end Wednesday. \"We have made this decision to give clarity for the coming week as we build the timeline for the phased restart of our operations and continue our investigation,\" the statement said. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said government officials were working closely with Jaguar Land Rover. \"But there is a wider issue here, of ensuring that foreign states, including Russia, cannot bring down production, or flights, or public services in Britain,\" she said in an interview with ITV News. \"It is a new and a growing threat.\" [David Bailey](https://www.upi.com/topic/David_Bailey/), a professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, told the BBC, \"one way or another, the government is going to take a hit\" from the shutdown. \"If bits of the supply chain go under that's going to make a restart at JLR much more difficult,\" he told BBC Radio WM.

    "full_text": "Pierluigi Paganini September 18, 2025 Jaguar Land Rover will keep vehicle production halted until at least September 24 following a cyberattack that hit the company earlier this month. Jaguar Land Rover will extend its production halt into a third week, keeping operations suspended until at least September 24 after a recent cyberattack. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is a British luxury vehicle manufacturer headquartered in Whitley, Coventry, UK. JLR combines two iconic brands, Jaguar and Land Rover. Since 2008, JLR has been owned by Tata Motors (India), which bought it from Ford. JLR sells vehicles in over 120 countries, with major markets in Europe, North America, and China. In early September, Jaguar Land Rover shut down systems to mitigate a cyberattack that disrupted production and retail operations. The attack also impacted systems at the Solihull production plant. UK dealers reported JLR disruptions blocking car registrations and parts supply. The company initially said customer data was not compromised. “JLR has been impacted by a cyber incident. We took immediate action to mitigate its impact by proactively shutting down our systems. We are now working at pace to restart our global applications in a controlled manner.” reads the statement published by the automaker. “At this stage there is no evidence any customer data has been stolen but our retail and production activities have been severely disrupt” The automaker did not disclose technical details about the incident; however, the group “Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters,” behind recent UK retail cyberattacks, claimed responsibility for the JLR attack. Last week, JLR confirmed that the cyberattack also led to a data breach without disclosing details about the type of information that has been compromised. “As a result of our ongoing investigation, we now believe that some data has been affected and we are informing the relevant regulators.” reads a statement issued by the carmaker. “Our forensic investigation continues at pace and we will contact anyone as appropriate if we find that their data has been impacted.” This week, the carmaker announced the halt in production will extend into its third week. Jaguar Land Rover said the delay stems from the controlled restart of its global operations, which requires additional time. “Today we have informed colleagues, suppliers and partners that we have extended the current pause in our production until Wednesday 24th September 2025.” reads the announcement. “We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time. We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.” The BBC said Jaguar Land Rover’s shutdown costs at least £50M weekly in lost output, as it misses producing about 1,000 cars per week. “Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has told suppliers that production at its factories will not resume until 24 September at the earliest following a serious cyber attack, but industry sources have warned disruption could last into November.” states BBC. “The shutdown is believed to be costing the company at least £50m a week in lost production. JLR would normally expect to build more than 1,000 cars a day.” Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini ( SecurityAffairs – hacking, JLR)",

[Subscribe](https://defensescoop.com/subscribe) Close The Air Force is working on a new defensive cyberspace operations campaign plan as it moves to protect military bases and utility companies against digital threats, according to a top commander. The effort comes amid concerns about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to China-backed actors. Prominent entities known as Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon, which are believed to be backed by the Chinese government, have particularly alarmed U.S. officials. “Volt Typhoon being a state-sponsored malicious cyber actor that has had persistent access in our CIKR infrastructure — critical information, key resources — \\[such as\\] water, energy, transportation, persistent access for five years. They haven’t done anything with it. … Salt Typhoon — persistent access into our telecommunication networks. So, persistent access, \\[but\\] they haven’t done anything with it. Why? Because they’re probably setting the conditions to execute destructive cyberattacks, should there be a regional conflict in the Pacific over Taiwan. And my words and my words only — nobody else has said this — but if we find ourselves in a conflict with China and they execute destructive cyberattacks against our critical infrastructure in the United States, that is total war in my definition,” Lt. Gen. Thomas Hensley, commander of 16th Air Force and Air Forces Cyber, said Monday during a panel at AFA’s Air, Space and Cyber conference. “Not total war in the sense of World War I total war or World War II … total war, but total war in the sense of all-domain warfare, using the cyber domain to execute a counter-value attack against the U.S. population in the United States.” Cyber threats are growing, not just against IT systems but also operational technology networks, he noted. Hensley highlighted the Stuxnet attack against Iran’s nuclear program and Russian cyber operations against Ukraine, as examples of how digital attacks can affect physical systems. “When you look at 2010, that’s Stuxnet, that’s when a cyberattack struck those nuclear centrifuges in Natanz in Iran, and they messed with the ones and zeros and caused those centrifuges to spin out of control and explode. \\[In\\] 2014, you have the Russians executing an OT cyberattack against Ukrainian electrical grid to set the conditions for \\[so-called\\] ‘little green men’ to go into Ukraine. And as we’ve seen in 2022 and nearly four years of conflict, we’ve seen the Russians use cyber against IT targets, against OT targets, and they’ve done it synchronized with their military operations, sort of a campaign plan, if you will,” he said. U.S. military bases are also at risk. “Whenever we talk about base defense, it’s always in terms of kinetics. It’s always in terms of, how do we defend against larger \\[operations squadrons\\], how do we defend against missile strikes? Those are absolutely reasons that are really important that we need to figure out. But we also need to start talking about terms of cybersecurity and cyber defense,” Hensley said. “We have to have resilient, reliable comms to do all of the functions that we have.” Complicating the challenge is the fact that many American bases depend on public utilities. “We can do all that we can to defend those bases, but realize that those bases rely on public utilities. So if those public utilities are attacked, you know, we’ll have a week, maybe two weeks of generator power to keep the missions going, but then that’s it, we’re out of Schlitz. So how do we protect the public utilities that are feeding … the bases so that we can continue to fight?” Hensley said. 16th Air Force is trying to tackle those issues via cybersecurity service providers and cyber protection teams. CSSPs are under the 688th Cyberspace Wing, and CPTs are under the 67th Cyberspace Wing. “Previously, we had always looked at those as like different mission sets, but in reality, they have a common mission, and that’s to secure and defend our networks,” Hensley said. CSSPs provide persistent monitoring of networks that affect weapon systems and command and control platforms. “If they find an anomaly, or they get some intel reporting that the bad guys is out there trying to do something, they’ll do incident response,” he explained. “The CPT teams, they’re more of a point defense focus and with a deeper dive, with exquisite tools that they use to root the adversary out, to kick them out, to mitigate and to harden that network. And so we’re coming up with a DCO \\[defensive cyberspace operations\\] campaign plan that better synchronizes the nexus between our persistent monitoring and our point defense. And so that’s a key piece, but that strategy is also going to have to rely on a sensor strategy and a data strategy to make use of that.” The Air Force is working through cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) with public utility companies at a variety of strategic locations and bases, he noted. There are different types of CRADAs that can be leveraged. “There’s an … \\[information sharing\\] CRADA where we can inform them of adversary activity in their networks. There’s a CRADA where we can share best practices and TTPs \\[tactics, techniques and procedures\\] on what works as far as eradicating adversaries that are in the networks. There are some CRADAs where, you know, we can get an agreement where we can put our sensors on their system, and we can do the persistent monitoring. That \\[last\\] one gets a little bit trickier, because you have Department of Homeland Security responsibilities and authorities — but the great thing is, if we got some \\[National\\] Guard folks that are out there, the Guard has authorities to be able to do that kind of work, and so they are key in that nexus point there,” Hensley said.

This year, a leading engineering society [graded](https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/civil-engineering-magazine/issues/magazine-issue/article/2025/05/the-urgent-need-for-energy-infrastructure-improvements) the country’s energy system a D+; 70 percent of transmission lines are more than 25 years old, 55 percent of transformers are near end of life, and the average lead time for new transformers is over a year. On top of all that, hotter and more frequent heat waves are degrading the grid. Despite these deficiencies, new demands are being made of the system, from massive new “hyperscale” data centers and more electric vehicle charging stations to the onshoring of manufacturing. Additionally, as temperatures rise and cyberattacks boosted by artificial intelligence (AI) become more potent, the United States needs to invest in a more resilient grid—or risk an energy insecure future. #### Past and future risks to grid reliability Threats to electricity systems include many new and evolving digital and physical risks to companies, cities, and individuals, including disruptions to technological and communications services. On the physical side, floods, fires, and extreme heat events, which are [increasingly posing physical threats](https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/weather-related-power-outages-rising) to energy infrastructure. Digital threats come in the form of ransomware and other cyberattacks, and sometimes arise simply out of the enormous complexity of today’s systems. For example, the [2024 CrowdStrike disruption](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/delta-crowdstrike-global-it-outage-explained)—which was caused by a faulty software update that crashed Windows systems worldwide—affected US Department of Energysystems as well as those at a number of [electric utilities](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/power-grid/outage-management/widespread-technology-outage-disrupts-flights-banks-media-outlets-and-companies-around-the-world/), and stranded or otherwise impacted 1.3 million airline passengers. When these events occur, disruptions to commerce and society follow and highlight the obligations that infrastructure planners and defenders have to limit harm from such incidents—obligations that simply cannot be deferred. And yet, upgrades to some of the most important parts of US critical infrastructure arebeing deferred. Today, on average, large US grid transformers, which are essential to electricity reliability, are [past their designed lifespan](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/EXEC-2022-001242%20-%20Large%20Power%20Transformer%20Resilience%20Report%20signed%20by%20Secretary%20Granholm%20on%207-10-24.pdf), and the backlog for replacements is [often three years or more](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/reshore-electrical-equipment-backlogs-transformer-breaker-nema/749265/). Grid operators—and all who depend on the grid—are forced to rely on this old equipment. Meanwhile, [rising temperatures are aging grid components faster](https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/topics-and-risk-dialogues/climate-and-natural-catastrophe-risk/impact-of-climate-on-electric-grids.html#:~:text=Global%20warming%20projections%20of%202,(%3E%204%C2%B0C)) by increasing chemical and mechanical stress on them, which leads to reduced efficiency, faster degradation, and increased failure rates. In addition to these long-standing challenges, three major trends have recently emerged that place additional pressure on the electric system: electricity-hungry, AI-powering data centers; the increasing number of electric vehicles and charging stations; and the electrification of everything, perhaps best represented by [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/heat-pumps-keep-widening-their-lead-on-gas-furnaces) replacing oil and gas-burning furnaces. At the same time, the nation is confronted with operational risks and constraints that US grid managers are struggling mightily to manage, such as how to handle increasing shares of non-dispatchable renewable generation as well as rapid policy changes like executive orders to keep coal plants running and restart shuttered nuclear plants. #### Disruption drives agile solutions There is a way forward, inspired by past grid failures and wartime emergencies. When challenged with disruptions, grid operators have not only responded with agility but also applied lessons learned to greatly reduce the potential for future cascades. The Northeastern blackout of 2003, for example, provided a major wake-up call. It affected [50 million people and cost about $6 billion](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2003-blackout-five-years-later/). While numerous improvements followed, three in particular did much to improve the [US grid’s resilience posture](https://www.energy.gov/oe/articles/blackout-2003-blackout-final-implementation-report) via enhanced communications: the installation by the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Committee (NERC) of a new conference bridge to greatly enhance communications during crises; the creation of a new set of procedures and protocols for reliability coordinator hotline calls; and enhancements to the decentralized system data exchange network with automated hourly uploads of outage data. Another example—a far more devastating one—is Russia’s targeting of energy infrastructure in Ukraine. Under heavy attacks aimed at knocking out civilian infrastructure, Ukrainians, in a show of unity, deployed backup generators and battery packs in unprecedented numbers, adhered to strict schedules for electricity usage set by the utilities, and—as much as possible—decentralized power generation. Although the United States is not at war, the impacts of climate change and cyberattacks could have similar effects on infrastructure and require similar solutions. To address the growing demand for electricity, the United States must generate and deliver much greater quantities of electricity reliably, safely, and securely, all while limiting emissions. Enhanced demand management, as practiced with precision in Ukraine, is one tool that may help. #### Anticipating future challenges The truth is that the US electric system is not operating the way it was designed. That’s because its developers did not anticipate the arrival of such dynamism. Meeting new challenges will require leadership and collective will, and for society to make itself more resilient by preparing in advance for more and longer-duration outages with backup generators and microgrids. To meet the challenges of a future where energy demand keeps rising, warming temperatures place new pressures on critical infrastructure, and cyber criminals threaten to cause massive disruption, the United States must leverage its collective imagination to rally its businesses and citizens to prepare for a less reliable grid. This is accomplished, in part, by full-scale exercises like NERC’s biennial [GridEx](https://www.nerc.com/pa/CI/ESISAC/Pages/GridEx.aspx) series, as well as through regional resilience summits. The property of resilience isn’t required until there is scarcity, a stressor, or other forms of adversity. It comes into play when an entity doesn’t have all that it needs or is under assault, but, by prior preparation, is not defeated. _[Andy Bochman](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) is the senior grid strategist for Idaho National Laboratory’s National and Homeland Security directorate._ ## About the author Former fellow ### [Andy Bochman](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) [Former Nonresident Senior Fellow](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) [Global Energy Center](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/our-programs/global-energy-center/) [Cybersecurity](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/cybersecurity/) [Energy & Environment](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/energy-environment/) ## Stay Connected #### Sign up for PowerPlay, the Atlantic Council’s bimonthly newsletter keeping you up to date on all facets of the energy transition ## related content [EnergySourceAug 28, 2025\\ \\ **Overheated and underbuilt: How to fortify the US grid in the face of heat waves** \\ \\ ByFrank Willey\\ \\ As demand for electricity rises across the United States—and in the Mid-Atlantic in particular—to cool homes and power data center growth, so does its cost.

In a fiery post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said that while India is a “friend”, it has imposed some of the “highest tariffs” on the United States and maintained “obnoxious” non-monetary trade barriers. The announcement comes after a slew of negotiated trade frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia — all of which Trump said would open markets for American goods while enabling the US to raise tax rates on imports. Donald Trump's 25% tariff announcement was met with strong criticism from Opposition leaders. Indian trade bodies have also voiced disappointment, with leaders in India’s gems and jewellery sector warning of short-term disruptions, job losses, and higher prices for US buyers, reported ANI.

After announcing the tariffs, Trump said the US is still negotiating with India on trade.

They also said that India will not be impacted to a very great extent due to some of the competing markets facing higher tariffs from the United States. 31 Jul 2025, 08:08:50 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: India does not need to panic, says former top US official “This is typical Trump trying to create as much pressure and chaos on a bilateral basis as possible, so that he can in the end claim victory by solving or at least ameliorating the problem which he's created...There is no need to panic and there should be saner heads on both the US and Indian side that can come to an agreement,” says former United States Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Trade Development, Ray Vickery. 31 Jul 2025, 07:57:26 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: India ready to concede, opines expert \"The announcement is coming in the context of the August 1 deadline and President Trump is obviously not looking to extend the deadline again and this time he wants to actually impose tariffs and use that as a leverage tool in the negotiation process...The imposition of tariffs has more to do with President Trump and the US not getting the expectations that they have out of India. India, on the other hand, is ready to concede what it is looking to do with other complementary economies like we've seen with the UK recently, but the US here clearly wants to go a few steps ahead,\" says fellow for the Chair on India and Emerging Asia Economics at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Gaurav Sansanwal. 31 Jul 2025, 07:45:34 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: Economist calls Trump tariff on India a setback for New Delhi Economist Suriya Narayanan reacted to the 25 per cent tariffs imposed on India by the United States President Donald Trump, calling it a setback for the country, with the move expected to impact Indian trade and exporters. While speaking to ANI, Economist Suriya Narayanan stated, \"This is a setback to India because India was exporting pharmaceuticals, copper, metals and more with zero tariffs. Now India has to pay for products exported to the US. This will impact the Indian exporters... This will impact the Indian trade, and Indian exporters expect some concessions... The American trade team will visit India on 25th August to further talk on this...\" 31 Jul 2025, 07:29:30 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: Tourism expert says tariffs will have ripple effect on manufacturing Chairman of the Tourism Expert Committee at the Chamber of Commerce, Subhash Goyal, on Wednesday said that the imposition of a 25 per cent tariff on Indian imports by US President Donald Trump would negatively impact Indian exports and have a ripple effect on the country's manufacturing sector. \"It is a sad day for Indian exports because India is doing exports worth over 100 billion dollars and our surplus is over $40 billion.

It is in the United States' interest to have a trade agreement with India. Both India and the United States have a long way to go to outcompete their strategic competition and adversaries. So, there's a lot at stake here for both countries...The President is not signalling a lack of confidence or a lack of interest in this strategic partnership. He's simply deploying a negotiating tactic that he has used in the past with very close partners and allies...I hope that our Indian friends will keep that in mind as well as they work through these issues,\" says former US Assistant State Secretary, Nisha Biswal. 31 Jul 2025, 06:49:57 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: Trump tariff on India can cut full year GDP rate by 20 bps, says expert “The 25% tariff rate is certainly a negative development as it compares to lower rate for peers such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines which compete with India in a similar category of labour-intensive products and electronic goods. The currency market had clearly priced this eventually as the USDINR pair moved by more than 70 paise today. The exact details of the tariffs on the exempted items such as pharma and the ones that were charged at a differential rate such as iron, steel and auto is unknown as of now, but inclusion of pharma into tariffs should be incremental negative for India’s exports as US accounts for more than 30% of India’s pharma exports. If no deal is signed by Sept-October, we see a downside to full year GDP growth estimate for India by 20 bps,” says Garima Kapoor, Economist and Executive Vice President, Elara Capital. 31 Jul 2025, 06:33:27 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: Trump says India willing to cut tariffs ‘substantially’ “We had a tremendous trade deficit. Prime Minister Modi is a friend of mine, but they don't do very much business in terms of business with us. They sell a lot to us, but we don't buy from them. Because the tariff is so high. They have one of the highest tariffs in the world. Now, they are willing to cut it very substantially. But we will see what happens. We are talking to India now. We will see what happens. It doesn't matter too much whether we have a deal or we charge them a certain tariff. But you will know at the end of this week,” Donald Trump said. 31 Jul 2025, 06:25:27 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: Trump's first comment following India tariff announcement “We are negotiating right now and it's also BRICS. BRICS, which is basically a group of countries that are anti the United States and India is a member of that...It is an attack on the dollar and we are not going to let anybody attack the dollar. So it's partially BRICS and it's partially trade,” Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday. 31 Jul 2025, 12:23:39 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: 'This is India’s moment to scale up,' says PHDCCI Chief CEO and Secretary General of PHDCCI, Ranjeet Mehta, said: \"We are now entering an era of new alignments in the global supply chain. The US is also recalibrating its trade policy by imposing tariffs on major exporting economies like China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and India. There will be a momentary impact on our MSMEs, but we see this as an opportunity, also. This is the time that India scales it up. We need to be more competitive and we need to see the diversified market. We have the demographic dividend, technological agility, and entrepreneurial depth.\" (ANI) 31 Jul 2025, 12:23:27 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: Indian jewellers turn to UK, Australia amid US tensions Avinash Gupta, Vice Chairman of the All India Gem & Jewellery Domestic Council, highlighted that a key advantage during US trade tensions is India’s existing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with countries like the UK and Australia. \"Definitely, it will affect the Gem and Jewellery Industry, but the best part is that the Indian Government has done FTAs with the UK, Australia and other countries also, so we have much more options available than the US only. We will have many more options for exporting to other countries. It will hurt us as the US is a big market for the Gem and Jewelery industry. It will affect us, but it will not hamper us,\" Gupta told ANI. 30 Jul 2025, 11:52:10 PM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: 'We’ve got options' - India industry leader hits back at US \"Given the current scenario, India has already found alternative routes.

This will also affect the US economy,\" Rajesh Rokde, Chairman of the All India Gem & Jewellery Domestic Council, said. 30 Jul 2025, 11:32:00 PM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: US tariffs could cripple India’s jewellery exports, warns Gems and Jewellery industry leader \"This is very unfortunate. The tariff that will be implemented from August 1 is not only painful for India but could also significantly hurt the US. I believe that imposing tariffs negatively affects businesses. India exports jewellery to the entire world. If we look at the numbers, trade worth nearly 9 billion dollars takes place with the US. This will be 100 percent affected. The handmade jewellery that is appreciated there will also be impacted. It will become more expensive in the US. This will be a very unfortunate situation for the jewellery industry,\" Rajesh Rokde, Chairman of the All India Gem & Jewellery Domestic Council, said. 30 Jul 2025, 10:47:23 PM IST ## US tariffs on India Live: Gems and jewellery leaders warn of short-term disruptions US tariffs on India Live: Leaders in India’s gems and jewellery sector raised concern, warning that imposing 25% tariffs could cause short-term disruptions, job losses, and higher prices for US buyers, reported ANI. 30 Jul 2025, 10:43:15 PM IST ## Trump tariffs LIVE: Indian trade bodies 'disappointed' with Trump's 25% tariff Trump tariffs LIVE: Indian trade bodies have voiced disappointment over US President Donald Trump's 25% tariff, calling it a blow to Indian exports.

    "full_text": "Search # Is India being forced closer to China and other BRICS nations by US tarrifs? / MOFA - People's Republic of China By bno Chennai OfficeAugust 22, 2025 India’s economic relationship with China has evolved in uneven but persistent ways since 2005, when both sides agreed that boundary disputes would not obstruct broader cooperation. That principle allowed trade to flourish despite recurring standoffs in Ladakh, Doklam, and Galwan. According to a new report by _Carnegie India_, [bilateral trade](https://www.intellinews.com/india-china-move-to-restart-border-trade-after-five-year-gap-396286/?source=india) grew from $17bn in 2005 to nearly $120bn by 2024, with China becoming India’s largest trading partner and the trade deficit swelling to almost $100bn. Attempts to narrow the gap by boosting Indian exports ran into Chinese non-tariff barriers in pharmaceuticals, IT, and procurement, leaving India structurally dependent on Chinese goods. Through these years, even the most violent clashes along the Line of Actual Control did not dent the trajectory of imports; only global shocks such as the 2008 financial crisis, the 2018 trade war, and the 2020 pandemic briefly slowed the deficit’s rise. Investment flows tell a more complex story. Chinese commitments in manufacturing and infrastructure spiked after 2014, riding Xi Jinping’s outbound investment liberalisation and Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” campaign. According to the _Carnegie India_ report, big-ticket deals, such as Fosun’s acquisition of Gland Pharma, signalled growing comfort with cross-border capital. But momentum was cut short by Beijing’s clampdown on outbound flows in 2016 and India’s abrupt policy pivot in 2020 after Galwan. The introduction of mandatory screening for investments from land-bordering countries effectively shut down new Chinese capital. Venture investment, which had funneled billions into India’s booming internet economy, was also caught in the crossfire. By 2019, nearly two-thirds of India’s unicorns counted Chinese investors, but the subsequent app bans and policy shifts triggered rapid unwinding. What was once a deepening digital partnership was dismantled within half a decade, leaving only a few residual stakes by 2025. Public procurement emerged as another battleground. A July 2020 order barred bidders from border-sharing countries without special clearance, effectively targeting Chinese construction and engineering firms. While this halted new government contracts, ongoing projects continued to generate billions in revenue for Chinese companies, and Indian contractors still relied heavily on Chinese input for railways and power equipment. This contradiction highlighted the limits of punitive procurement policies in a market where domestic substitutes remain underdeveloped. The broader calculus grew even more complicated in 2025 as India’s relationship with the US has hit turbulence during Donald Trump’s second term. Early in the year, both sides announced ambitious trade targets, but optimism soured quickly. Trump imposed steep tariffs on Indian exports under the banner of “reciprocity,” escalating the measures within weeks. He further linked a hike in tariff to penalties on India’s continued imports of discounted Russian oil, casting the issue as one of strategic loyalty. New Delhi dismissed the tariffs as unjustified and bristled at Washington’s attempts to dictate its energy policy. The trade war spilled into defense, with reports of procurement delays feeding speculation about a deeper chill in ties. The friction with Washington also carried political consequences at home. Modi’s government, once keen to frame India as a natural US partner in countering China, now faced a difficult balancing act. Public opinion turned skeptical of the reliability of American commitments, while business lobbies fretted over lost export markets. The sudden reversal in tone from Washington reinforced India’s instinct to hedge, looking beyond its Quad partnership to [options within BRICS](https://www.intellinews.com/the-unintended-consequence-of-trump-s-tariffs-is-pushing-brics-together-396138/?source=india) and other multilateral formats. For Beijing, the cracks in the US-India relationship presented an opening to soften its own posture and explore areas of cooperation despite the lingering shadow of Galwan. Taken together, these dynamics underscore the paradox at the heart of India’s economic statecraft. Trade with China remains indispensable but lopsided. Investment ties can be throttled or revived depending on political calculations. Procurement restrictions reveal dependency even when couched in national security terms. And now, India must contend with an uncertain partner in Washington, where tariff wars and energy disputes have cast doubt on the stability of what was once touted as a defining partnership. The result is an India forced to refine its playbook, seeking flexibility, developing layered tools of retaliation and deterrence, and ensuring that neither neighbor nor ally can dictate the terms of its economic future.

On April 28, India and Pakistan entered their fifth consecutive day of cross-border gunfire, following India's accusations that Pakistan was involved in the April 22 militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 civilians and injured 17 others. The Resistance Front -- a militant group India accuses of being a front for the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba -- initially claimed responsibility for the attack, which it says was in opposition to India sending more than 85,000 \"outsiders\" to Kashmir to promote \"demographic change.\" The Resistance Front, which formed in the wake of India's contentious 2019 revocation of Kashmir's autonomy, has claimed sporadic attacks on non-locals in the region...",

This demonstrates how cyber operations have evolved beyond merely gathering intelligence. When first identified by US government partners back in mid-2023, the campaign by the Salt Typhoon group was assessed as a targeted espionage effort against US and allied government systems. It involved stealthy intrusions, selective data theft and probing of networks in a handful of countries. At the time, the effect was thought to be limited and largely confined to government targets. But August 2025 disclosures have shown just how broad the campaign truly has been. The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has [publicly attributed](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/countering-chinese-state-sponsored-actors-compromise-of-networks-worldwide-to-feed-global-espionage-system) the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. They are central to rivalry. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge. The Indo-Pacific is the epicentre of 21st-century competition. China and the US vie for influence, while South Korea, India, Japan and Southeast Asian countries all face mounting digital vulnerabilities. With the digital economy of Southeast Asian nations expected to surpass US$1 [trillion](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/asean-building-trust-digital-economy/) by 2030, growth is driving their prosperity but also compounding risk. Chinese-sponsored hackers have been targeting critical infrastructure for a long time. Suspected Chinese hackers disrupted India’s [port](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/securing-indian-ports-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-and-the-road-ahead) logistics in 2020, and repeated intrusions have targeted Japanese, South Korean and Australian energy grids, telecom systems and government networks. Cyber operations are applied to traditional hotspots—such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait—by threatening disruption without any shots being fired. Beyond the sheer number of cyber incidents, patterns in their objectives distinguish cyber operations in the Indo-Pacific from those in other regions. Three stand out: probing, pressuring, and threshold testing. Probing operations aim to identify and target system vulnerabilities. Chinese threat group APT41 often employs this method. The [group](https://cyberscoop.com/apt41-fireeye-china/) has conducted espionage operations across healthcare, telecoms and government agencies for many years. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has perfected a distinct form of probing: cyber-heists, ranging from the 2016 Bangladesh Bank [hack](https://cyber.uk/areas-of-cyber-security/cyber-security-threat-groups-2/nation-state-hackers-case-study-bangladesh-bank-heist/) to ongoing cryptocurrency thefts that directly fund Pyongyang’s weapons programs. These operations map vulnerabilities and generate funds, while staying below the threshold of conventional war. Australia has been a repeated target of pressuring tactics, with the [breaches](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/reports-and-statistics/annual-cyber-threat-report-2023-2024) of critical infrastructure widely interpreted as signaling that Canberra’s alignment with Washington has costs. Taiwan is another case in point. During its 2024 elections, disinformation campaigns, distributed denial-of-service attacks on government portals, and breaches of media outlets sought to [undermine](https://saferinternetlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Panel-4-Summer.pdf) confidence in the democratic process. These pressures were synchronised with more visible coercion, such as military exercises and air incursions, illustrating how digital operations complement kinetic manoeuvres. Some cyber campaigns appear to be aimed at threshold-testing, blurring the line between espionage and sabotage. In the Vietnam–China cyber [clashes](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/vietnams-securitisation-of-cybersecurity-under-growing-chinese-cyber-threats/) related to South China Sea disputes, Vietnamese hackers allegedly targeted Chinese government websites. Similarly, the 2021 Japan Olympics cyberattacks, which [some](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54600098) attributed to Russian actors, demonstrated how geopolitical rivalries could extend into civilian life. Together, these incidents outline a region where states and non-state actors continually challenge each other’s resolve. Skirmishes might not cause immediate destruction, but they foster digital coercion and raise the risk of escalation. Cyber campaigns are not just harassment; some signal a potential for escalation. Attacks against Taiwan’s government networks have spiked during Chinese military drills, showing how cyber and kinetic tools are increasingly integrated. The danger lies in miscalculation. A ransomware strike that disrupts Japan’s energy grid or South Korea’s financial sector could be interpreted as state-backed aggression, prompting military responses. In cyberspace, where [attribution](https://academic.oup.com/isp/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/isp/ekae022/7903056) is murky and timeframes are compressed, escalation could outrun diplomacy. Repeated incidents also risk normalising cyber coercion as a standard tool of statecraft. If probing and pressure go unchallenged, adversaries will keep pushing until the region faces a full-scale digital confrontation. The Indo-Pacific has become a laboratory for cyber conflict, setting global precedents. Europe, Latin America and Africa should watch closely: today’s coercion in Asia could become tomorrow’s global standard. Cyber skirmishes in the Indo-Pacific mark the cutting edge of strategic competition, where adversaries test limits and normalise coercion. The region’s growing dependence on digital infrastructure, combined with its strategic volatility, makes it a perilous testing ground for cyber conflict globally. The choice is stark: treat these incidents as minor disruptions until one sparks a crisis, or act to strengthen resilience, deepen cooperation and set rules for [responsible](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/curbing-the-cost-of-cybersecurity-fragmentation-an-agenda-for-harmonisation-across-the-indo-pacific/) behaviour in cyberspace. If governments fail, adversaries will decide the thresholds for acceptable action—and by then it may be too late.

For those who ask what is the benefit for Public &amp; GoI apart from the profits to that private refiner, please check the Average Brent crude oil price here for the last 3 years https://www.statista.com/statistics/...es-since-1976/ And check the pump prices which directly affects the public. It will show the retail prices are constant when crude price varied between 80 to 100 USD. It is because of cheap Russian oil. This Government has mastered the art of adjusting taxes to keep the retail prices constant. Remember during COVID, when oil prices crashed, taxes were jacked up and no benefits passed to us. I am okay as long as it is 2 way street. Now on the supply side, GoI did clamped the Windfall tax from July 2022 till Dec 2024 and kept adjusting it to get a windfall tax collection of around 50000 Crores from RIL, ONGC and OIL. Refer the quarterly reports of them in the FY22 to 23 and see the drop in profits. I remember it as I took a 'long' bet on ONGC at 120 and finally sold at 240. While it is plausible that the tax money would have been spent on some Yojana for votes as usual, I will consider this money is part of the contribution for all the UPI transactions that is being subsidized even today. And by the way, it was EU and US that proposed the price cap of 60 USD for Russian oil. It made sure that there is no oil shock in the system. They even pushed us to take the oil. And at the same time, denied shipping and insurance for Russian oil. Please read about how much money was spent to get those tankers and insurance set up which will show the true cost of Russian oil. So in the end everybody benefitted except possibly Ukraine. ( 33) Thanks 7th August 2025, 17:57 # 171 Distinguished - BHPian Join Date: Aug 2014 Location: Delhi-NCR Posts: 4,409 Thanked: 74,938 Times Re: Trump starts imposing tough tariffs on other countries | Are tariffs good or bad? Several members have raised the question on fuel prices and how Russian crude has helped India if at all. Lot of anecdotal material and opinions out there. I am no expert on oil prices and defer to any members who are experts on petro trading &amp; procurement. Just prior to the Ukraine conflict USA had imposed sanctions on Venezuelan oil and Iran oil thus squeezing supply in the global market, keeping prices firm and helping US oil producers along the way. Even India and China had stopped buying oil from Iran. With the Ukraine war in 2022 USA requested India (and I think Japan) to buy more from Russia despite so called US sanctions because they (the Americans) realized that eliminating Russian crude from the global market will send prices too high to everyone's detriment including US allies and NATO countries. That is why Indian purchases of Russian oil went from ~68,000 barrels a day in January 2022 to 1.9 million barrels a day today. Russian crude came at 7% to 13% cheaper than other crudes because not every country was willing to risk buying it and not every refinery is designed to handle it. In the context of India being the 3rd largest importer of crude these are large discounts. Plus we had the added bonus of paying in INR (that has created another set of headaches but that tale is for another day). The benefit of that cheaper crude really goes to the Govt through superior profits of our oil companies which plays a meaningful role in funding Govt programmes. In 2021 across India petrol at the pump was an average of around Rs 95/- per litre. Today 4 years on with general inflation in the region of 5% the average price is Rs 105 per litre. If we do the arithmetic then yes Russian crude has helped us hold stable the cost of petrol at the pump. The retail price of diesel tells the real story. Price in Delhi in March 2021, just as India started processing Russian crude was Rs 86.67 per litre. On 7th August 2025, in Delhi, it is Rs 87.67 per litre an increase of just over 1% in 4 years. * Those are the facts. Rest is opinion and attitude of some politicians. The Govt of India led by a brilliant quiet petroleum bureaucrat, Tarun Kapoor, did India good on this one. With global GDP growth slowing it is likely crude prices will soften thus reducing the discount advantage. Who is buying Russian Energy. Share this chart, I pulled together, with all. Let us counter Trump's lies with data. * Diesel prices ex-Delhi. Prices in other States are likely to differ. The aim is not to argue about prices but the fact that they are holding steady - in part thanks to Russian crude. Last edited by V.Narayan : 7th August 2025 at 18:26.

To add to this what government did all this \"extra\" money, we should also not forget the oil bonds that we issued by government in yesteryears when crude used to be very expensive. I am told that the last trench of those would be retiring in 2026. From what I remember those are some hefty payments. I think government has wisely moved to a stable price policy (from a policy earlier that was around market linked price whereby every fortnight prices at the pump used to change) subconsciously for us stable prices are far more comforting than price swings. And oil is a commodity that can swing a lot depending on geopolitical situations. A stable price policy is probably better from that point of view.

Petroleum subsidies were historically a massive expense for the government. Taxes on Petroleum (Central/State/Excise and what not) is now a massive revenue generator for the government. And in this duration, indirect income tax has leaped while direct income tax has seen negligible cuts. Fuel prices continue to remain high, when they shouldn't ideally be (given the global crude oil prices) and even more so when it's blended with Ethanol (which is much cheaper than petrol). Long story short, I think many tax-paying &amp; law-abiding citizens have gotten a raw deal. We continue to get exploited, as there are larger voices that matter to the powers up above. And this does not begin or end with Russian oil.

Minor correction (though I know you probably meant Uncle Sam as a joke) - it will be Trump and not Uncle Sam. The two are different. Trump always puts himself first, not necessarily his country. Quote: Originally Posted by NomadSK Inflation is in check for India, while Ukraine Russia happened, while Iran conflict happened, while Houthi destabilized the Bab al-Mandab Strait, the Gulf of Aden, all thanks to Russian Crude !! Precisely. I'm glad you said this. I know that Nirmala Sitharaman gets a lot of (mostly justified) flak for many of her policies, but India could have very well gone the Sri Lankan way and the only reason we didn't is because we bought cheap Russian oil, and did not pass on the price cut to the general public. The government correctly guessed that everyone has got used to the current level of prices and as long as prices didn't go up, people would not really care. It was a master class in managing what could have been a deficit and an inflationary spiral and I have grudging admiration for the finance minister and the other powers that be for this move. On another note, I also like the robust and combative statements that this government and especially our foreign minister makes from time to time - especially when he calls a spade a spade and calls out hypocrisy openly. Maybe he is not the best diplomat (in that he is unlike other diplomats of the past who were more circumspect and turned the other cheek) and sometimes the combativeness backfires, but at the end of the day the assertiveness is a welcome change. Bullies eventually stop bullying those who fight back, and though I have a lot of issues with many other things being done by this government (including increasing the ethanol component in fuel) on these two aspects at least, I totally support the steps taken so far.

The company confirmed that it had shut down its systems as a precautionary measure to contain the impact. According to AFP, the UK-based automaker said, “At this stage there is no evidence any customer data has been stolen but our retail and production activities have been severely disrupted,” adding that it is “working at pace” to restart worldwide operations. The incident highlights the increasing vulnerability of luxury retailers and auto brands to cybercriminals. Recently, Marks and Spencer suffered a major attack that disabled its online operations for weeks, causing losses of £300 million ($402 million). Other well-known British retailers such as Harrods and Co-op have also faced cyber threats in recent months. For Jaguar Land Rover, the cyberattack adds to a string of recent setbacks. Earlier this year, the automaker paused exports to the United States after tariffs imposed under former President Donald Trump, which triggered a steep decline in sales. In July, JLR announced plans to cut up to 500 UK management jobs to manage costs. Although a new trade agreement between London and Washington lowered tariffs on UK car exports to 10% from 27.5%, the concession only applies to a limited quota of 100,000 vehicles annually, restricting the company’s ability to recover volumes.

The United States’ power grid, once a marvel of 20th-century engineering, is now teetering on the edge of collapse. As demand surges from emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles, an aging infrastructure struggles to keep up. Recent blackouts, escalating costs, and regulatory bottlenecks are painting a picture of a system pushed to its limits. This article explores the crisis, what investors should watch for moving forward, and the ripple effects on everyday consumers, drawing on expert analysis and recent data. ### The Cracks in the Foundation: Why the Grid is Failing ### [Are you Paying High Taxes in New Jersey, New York, or California?](https://energynewsbeat.co/invest/) America’s electrical grid was largely built in the mid-20th century, with much of its transmission and distribution infrastructure now over 50 years old. According to recent reports, the grid faces unprecedented stress from a combination of factors. Electricity demand is skyrocketing: AI data centers alone consumed about 4.4% of U.S. electricity in 2023, a figure projected to triple by 2028. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts electricity sales to climb from 4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025, equivalent to adding the power needs of seven Seattle-sized cities in the next decade. Extreme weather exacerbates the vulnerabilities. Heatwaves in Texas and storms in California have triggered widespread blackouts, reminiscent of the 2003 Northeast blackout that left 50 million people in the dark. Cybersecurity threats and physical attacks on substations are on the rise, with the Department of Homeland Security emphasizing the grid’s critical status. Supply chain issues further compound the problem: lead times for large power transformers have stretched beyond 30 months by mid-2025, delaying essential upgrades. Regulatory hurdles add to the chaos. Transmission projects face five-to-seven-year delays due to permitting issues, jurisdictional disputes between utilities, states, and federal agencies, and policy gridlock. The CIRCUIT Act, introduced in February 2025 to boost domestic transformer production, remains stalled in Congress. Deloitte estimates that the U.S. power sector will require $1.4 trillion in new capital investments between 2025 and 2030 just to maintain reliability. ### Investment Opportunities: Where to Look as the Crisis Unfolds For investors, this gridlock isn’t just a headache—it’s a goldmine of opportunities. The push for modernization and reliability will favor certain sectors over others. Here’s what to watch: ### Behind-the-Meter Solutions and Companies As the centralized grid falters, decentralized “behind-the-meter” technologies—such as battery storage, microgrids, and rooftop solar—are gaining traction. These solutions allow businesses and households to generate and store power independently, reducing reliance on the main grid. Companies like Fluence Energy, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are poised for growth, with demand surging for their storage systems to handle peak loads from data centers and EVs. The Department of Energy (DOE) is allocating $32 million in 2025 for smart EV charging and distributed energy integration, signaling federal support. Investors should eye firms innovating in energy management software and modular storage, as these could see explosive adoption in high-demand regions like Northern Virginia, which handles 70% of global internet traffic. ### Natural Gas and Oil Companies Reliability is king in a strained grid, and fossil fuels still provide the backbone. With coal plants retiring (e.g., Utah’s 1,800 MW Intermountain Power Project), natural gas and oil are stepping in as “bridge” fuels. The DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants to avert shortages. Natural gas firms benefit from their flexibility and lower emissions profile compared to coal, while oil companies could see upticks in backup generation demand. Look for integrated energy giants with strong midstream assets, as they can capitalize on rising wholesale prices in deregulated markets like Texas and Arizona, where cooling demands are surging. Grid UtilitiesTraditional utilities are investing heavily to shore up the system. The DOE aims to boost long-distance transmission capacity by 16% by 2030 through 7,500 miles of new lines. Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion Energy, and Avangrid are leading the charge—Avangrid, for instance, plans $20 billion in investments across 23 states through 2030. These regulated utilities offer stable dividends and exposure to rate hikes as costs pass through to consumers. Independent power producers like NRG Energy are also attractive, profiting from elevated wholesale electricity prices amid supply constraints. In summary, a diversified approach makes sense: behind-the-meter for growth potential, natural gas/oil for reliability plays, and utilities for steady returns. However, risks like regulatory changes and supply chain disruptions loom large—focus on companies with strong balance sheets and innovation pipelines. ### How Consumers Will Feel the Pinch The grid’s woes will hit consumers hardest through higher bills and unreliable service. As utilities pass on upgrade costs, residential electricity prices are climbing nationwide—up about 6.5% from May 2024 to May 2025. Blackouts could become more frequent, disrupting daily life, work, and safety, especially in vulnerable areas prone to weather extremes. The impact varies by state, with some already facing exorbitant rates due to reliance on imported fuels, geography, or high demand. Below is a table of the top 10 most expensive states for residential electricity, based on EIA data for June 2025 (in cents per kWh). These states, often coastal or isolated, illustrate the uneven burden. Consumers in these states could see monthly bills exceed $200 for average usage, prompting shifts toward energy efficiency, solar adoption, or even relocation. Nationally, a Microsoft and Google-backed report warns of a shortage of 500,000 electricians in the next decade, further delaying home upgrades and EV installations. ### Looking Ahead: A Call for Action America’s grid crisis demands urgent investment and policy reform to avert catastrophe. While challenges mount, they also herald a transformation toward a smarter, more resilient energy system. Investors who position themselves wisely—balancing innovation with reliability—stand to benefit, but only if policymakers act swiftly. For consumers, the message is clear: prepare for higher costs and potential disruptions by exploring personal energy solutions today. ## [Avoid Paying Taxes in 2025](https://energynewsbeat.co/investinoil/) [Crude Oil, LNG, Jet Fuel price quote](http://energynewsbeat.co/tradingdesk/) [ENB Top News](http://energynewsbeat.co/top-news/)[ENB](http://energynewsbeat.co/) [Energy Dashboard](https://dashboard.energynewsbeat.com/?_gl=1*ij4iab*_ga*NTEyODgzNzk5LjE3MjM3Mzk2NjU.*_ga_JDVH4V200Q*MTcyNTU2OTQ3MC4xMzMxLjEuMTcyNTU2OTQ5Ny4zMy4wLjA.)

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

The most violent states in this corridor have been Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Orissa. The region is defined by rolling hills covered in dense forest and has few improved roads, which allows the Naxalites to control access. The dense foliage also protects them from government aircraft.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

[Doomberg](https://substack.com/@doomberg) Sep 28, 2025 ∙ Paid 663 [122](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/energy-bind/comments) 22 [Share](javascript:void(0)) _“You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that \\[is\\] it’s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.”_ – Rahm Emanuel One of the great mysteries of our time is why so few media outlets or geopolitical analysts incorporate energy as a core input to their explanations of contemporary events and predictions of the future. While no single parameter is all-encompassing, energy is among the most powerful, and exploring where significant oil and gas resources and infrastructure exist often yields useful insights that defy consensus. Consider Argentina. As early as September 10th, we [postulated](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/mosaic-theory) that the US might be tempted to bail out the country, largely because it is home to one of the largest and most exciting shale oil and gas plays in the world: > “ _The Trump administration may feel compelled to mount a rearguard action in Argentina on behalf of loyal ally President Javier Milei, whose political party was roundly defeated in local elections over the weekend. Although the results do not directly impact his standing at the federal level, the electoral setback is spooking markets just as oil and gas production in the country’s massive Vaca Muerta shale resource is taking off. The country’s bonds and currency both plunged on the news._” Less than two weeks later, [things evolved](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/us/politics/us-argentina-bessent-javier-milei.html) as we anticipated: > “ _The Trump administration pledged on Monday to do whatever is necessary to support Argentina’s struggling economy, throwing a lifeline to the country’s embattled president, Javier Milei, ahead of legislative elections there next month._ > > _Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the United States is prepared to offer loans to Argentina’s central bank, direct currency purchases and purchases of U.S. dollar-denominated Argentine government debt from Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund to keep Argentina’s economy afloat. The value of Argentina’s currency, the peso, has fallen in recent weeks amid concerns about Mr. Milei’s political grip on government._” A deal in progress \\| Getty Over at CNN, the news unsurprisingly was framed through the lens of raw partisan politics. In an analysis titled “ [The Argentina bailout is all about propping up a Trump ally](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/25/business/argentina-bailout-trump-milei),” the words “oil,” “gas,” and “Vaca Muerta” don’t even merit an appearance. Instead, it all comes down to ideology: > “ _The US’s sudden love for Argentina’s economy ‘doesn’t make any sense from a realist, strategic perspective,’ Nate Schenkkan, an independent international relations expert, said in an interview. ‘This kind of stuff only really makes sense within an ideological framework.’_” If one eschews Mr. Schenkkan’s ideological framework and turns instead to brute physics and finance, the potential for significant deals to be struck between Argentina and the Trump administration appears clear. If we are right, the impact on geopolitics and energy will be substantial. Let’s make a few predictions based on the pattern of evidence. ## This post is for paid subscribers [Subscribe](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/subscribe?simple=true&next=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter.doomberg.com%2Fp%2Fenergy-bind%3Futm_source%3D%252Finbox%26utm_medium%3Dreader2&utm_source=paywall&utm_medium=web&utm_content=174682665) [Already a paid subscriber? **Sign in**](https://substack.com/sign-in?redirect=%2Fp%2Fenergy-bind%3Futm_source%3D%252Finbox%26utm_medium%3Dreader2&for_pub=doomberg&change_user=false) PreviousNext",

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

In October, the South China Morning Post reported that China had revived plans to build a 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) tunnel to divert water to Xinjiang province from the Yarlung Tsangpo River in southern Tibet and was testing the technique on a separate tunnel project. China denied that any such plans were underway. But when the Sang River then appeared muddier than normal in recent weeks and displayed elevated levels of iron, it struck a nerve in India. A local leader running for office in Arunachal Pradesh speculated that Chinese construction was responsible for the pollution, but he failed to provide evidence to back up his assertion and both Indian and Chinese leaders denied that China was responsible for the muddy waters. On Dec. 4, Indian Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said an earthquake that took place...

setting it up using our simple webchat available at: [https://wikileaks.org/talk](https://wikileaks.org/talk) If you can use Tor, but need to contact WikiLeaks for other reasons use our secured webchat available at **http://wlchatc3pjwpli5r.onion** We recommend contacting us over Tor if you can.

In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor. #### Tails If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called [Tails](https://tails.boum.org). Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.

Please review these basic guidelines. #### 1\\. Contact us if you have specific problems If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please [contact us](https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/10/1042535_-ct-india-country-brief-111118-.html#submit_help_contact). In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations. #### 2\\. What computer to use If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use [Tails](https://tails.boum.org) to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer. #### 3\\. Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.

Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations. #### 2\\. Act normal If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour. #### 3\\. Remove traces of your submission If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies.

This decrease in value forced the company to cancel its $2.4 billion share sale on Jan. 31, and on Feb. 6-7, Adani announced his intention to pre-pay loans, including loans backed by Adani Group shares, to calm investor sentiment and demonstrate that the conglomerate has sufficient liquidity.

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power.

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

(Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Thus far, only sporadic violent plots and a few low-level attacks have targeted AI infrastructure like data centers. For the most part, pushback has taken the form of rhetoric and some nonviolent protests. The muted response reflects the fact that, for now, AI has yet to significantly demonstrate the type of grand promises or perils forecast by its dreamers or doomsdayers. This will not last. As AI ripples across societies and workplaces, upending daily life, labor markets and politics, the upheaval will inevitably spark backlash -- and at least some of the aggrieved will resort to violence.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

    "full_text": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India...",

(BIJU BORO/AFP/Getty Images) ## Highlights - _Despite the size and importance of the massive interconnected river system China and India share (along with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh), no integrated structure exists for its management, and the bilateral agreements that govern it are far from sufficient._ - _Political disputes, such as the 2017 standoff over the Doklam Plateau, could harm the waterways China and India share._ - _Unless the countries agree to institute a basinwide mechanism for water management, the river systems they both depend on will be at risk._ Nearly a year after their standoff on the Doklam Plateau began, India and China are trying to get their relationship back on track. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last month in Wuhan with just that goal in mind, and though their summit was more spectacle than substance, it was nonetheless a necessary step toward resolution. The informal meeting gave the two leaders a prime opportunity to lay aside, however briefly, their countries' long-standing differences and focus on topics of mutual concern, such as climate change, food security and natural disasters. Yet one related issue was missing from the agenda: water. If Beijing and New Delhi fail to address the matter, the repercussions for the region, its inhabitants and its environment will likely be devastating....

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up...",

While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances.
