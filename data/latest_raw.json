Know the difference [India Today Information Desk](https://www.indiatoday.in/author/india-today-information-desk) New Delhi,UPDATED: May 7, 2025 12:58 IST ### In Short - India's Operation Sindoor targets terror sites in Pakistan and PoK - LOC is volatile with frequent skirmishes and terror threats - LAC is ambiguous, leading to sporadic clashes with China In the aftermath of Operation Sindoor, a precision military strike by India targeting nine terror-linked sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), the spotlight is back on India’s most volatile borders: the Line of Control (LOC) and the Line of Actual Control (LAC). But which of these is the real flashpoint, and what sets them apart? While both the LOC and LAC are critical to India’s security calculus, the LOC, given its history of cross-border terrorism and regular skirmishes, remains the more immediate and volatile flashpoint-especially in the context of operations like Sindoor. The LAC, though unpredictable, represents a different kind of strategic challenge, rooted in ambiguity and the potential for rapid escalation. advertisement ### UNDRSTANDING THE LOC AND LAC: **LINE OF CONTROL (LOC):** - The LOC is a 740–776 km long military control line dividing Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. - It was formalised after the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War via the Simla Agreement in 1972 and is clearly demarcated on maps signed by both armies. - The LOC is heavily militarised, with Indian and Pakistani troops facing each other directly, leading to frequent skirmishes and cross-border firing. **LINE OF ACTUAL CONTROL (LAC):** - The LAC is an approximately 3,488 km (Indian estimate) or 2,000 km (Chinese estimate) notional boundary separating Indian-controlled territory from Chinese-controlled territory, stretching across Ladakh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh. - Unlike the LOC, the LAC is not mutually agreed upon, mapped, or demarcated on the ground, leading to overlapping claims and frequent patrol face-offs. - The LAC has buffer zones, and armies usually maintain a distance, though recent years have seen violent clashes, notably in Galwan (2020). ### KEY DIFFERENCES: LOC VS LAC | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | **Feature** | **LOC (India-Pakistan)** | **LAC (India-China)** | | Nature | Demarcated, mapped, and agreed upon | Not mutually agreed, not demarcated | | Length | 740–776 km | 2,000–3,488 km | | Militarisation | Heavily militarised, direct troop confrontation | Buffer zones, less direct confrontation | | Frequency of clashes | Frequent firing, infiltration, terror threats | Face-offs, standoffs, less firing | | Legal status | Result of Simla Agreement (1972) | Based on 1993 and 1996 agreements, not a treaty | ### WHERE IS THE REAL FLASHPOINT? advertisement Operation Sindoor’s targets-terror camps in Pakistan and PoK-underscore that the LOC remains the most active and immediate flashpoint for India’s security. The LOC sees frequent infiltration, terror attacks, and direct military engagement, making it a persistent source of tension and violence. The recent Pahalgam attack and subsequent Indian strikes highlight how the LOC remains the epicenter of India-Pakistan hostilities. In contrast, the LAC with China, while volatile and prone to standoffs, is characterised by ambiguity and sporadic but intense flare-ups. The lack of a mutually recognised boundary means tensions can escalate quickly, as seen in Galwan, but the frequency and nature of conflict differ from the LOC. ### WHY THE DIFFERENCE MATTERS The LOC is about day-to-day military vigilance and counter-terror operations, with the risk of escalation ever-present.The LAC is about strategic posturing, infrastructure buildup, and the risk of sudden, localised clashes due to its undefined nature.

    "full_text": "## _China’s narrative and material backing of Pakistan throughout the current Kashmir crisis is worrying India’s overstretched military._ India and Pakistan are embroiled in hostilities in the aftermath of a terror attack on civilians in Pahalgam, Kashmir on April 22. India’s military response is the result of Pakistan’s military-jihadi complex perpetrating terrorism and discord in Kashmir. With [Operation Sindoor](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2127370), India has set a new normal by expanding the scale of its response to terrorism. This includes moving beyond Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and terror camps and sites to striking targets closer to military installations across Pakistan. This operation was undertaken to respond to Pakistan’s escalation on May 7, wherein it retaliated to India’s counterterrorism response by shelling border areas. India has also demonstrated a willingness and capability to undertake drone warfare, including the liberal use of loitering munition. On May 10, Pakistan claimed Indian missiles hit [three air bases](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-drones.html) within the country. As the conflict continues, the international community has engaged with both India and Pakistan, seeking de-escalation. The path to a thaw, however, remains elusive. India faces two overlapping security dilemmas—how to manage both the naval and continental theaters and how to face its two most troublesome neighbors—Pakistan and China. As a regional power, a strategic ally of Pakistan, and a threat actor for India, China is developing its own response to the hostilities. Chinese government officials and media are shaping rhetoric on what India-Pakistan tensions mean for each of the actors specifically and for regional stability in general. Beijing is also enhancing Pakistan’s defense arsenal. In this regard, it becomes vital to understand China’s position and role in the matter. ### **The China Angle** Under the fog of war, information is skewed, manipulated, and hidden. However, reporting indicates that Pakistan has deployed Chinese defense systems against India in the ongoing conflict. The arsenal likely includes the JF-17 and [J-10](https://www.ft.com/content/ff46ca13-a64d-4ba1-833e-1bb348880aec) jet fighters as well as the [HQ-9P](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3309635/india-says-it-targeted-pakistans-radar-clash-amid-speculation-system-was-made-china) air defense missile system. In general, China is one of Pakistan’s most vital economic partners, and China itself has continued to invest in Pakistan as a [proxy](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/china-is-setting-the-world-on-fire) against India. Beijing sustains support even though Islamabad cannot guarantee the security of Chinese assets, including the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) infrastructure in Balochistan, from [internal ethnic insurgencies](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/pakistans-coming-collapse-should-worry-world-203545). In the current context, China’s posturing revolves around three dimensions. First is its implicit backing of Pakistan’s narrative. Though often framed as a commitment to regional peace and stability, China’s position is fundamentally aligned with Islamabad’s interests. Chinese narratives tend to amplify Pakistan’s viewpoints and policy positions, all the while casting doubt on New Delhi’s responses to terrorism by frequently characterizing India’s actions as [irrational](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202504/1333075.shtml) or excessive. Official Chinese coverage has [referred](https://english.news.cn/20250426/81e0c964bbb84936aef3bce6b0f6a846/c.html) to the Pahalgam attack as a “recent incident in Pahalgam of Indian-controlled Kashmir,” thus denying either terrorism or Pakistani involvement. This approach undermines India’s legitimate security concerns and bolsters Pakistan’s stance on the international stage. Second, Beijing has sought to [project itself](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3309356/china-urges-restraint-india-pakistan-tensions-escalate-military-strikes) as a potential “mediator” between India and Pakistan. However, this posture appears largely symbolic. The primary objective behind the pitch to mediate seems to be to internationalize the issue. This is something that Pakistan welcomes, but India resists. That said, such statements from China should be taken with a grain of salt because if it were a serious proposal, it would have been discussed at the sidelines of the [Fifteenth Meeting of the BRICS National Security Advisors](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbzhd/202505/t20250505_11615533.html) in Rio de Janeiro on April 30, 2025. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi also held a [meeting](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjbzhd/202504/t20250429_11609213.html) with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in Rio. Still, there was no mention of the India-Pakistan standoff, even though Pakistani defense minister Khwaja Asif, in an [interview](https://ria.ru/20250429/pakistan-2013961328.html) with RIA Novosti, had called on both Beijing and Moscow to establish an inquiry into the events of Pahalgam. Third, Chinese voices acknowledge that the fallout from a hot war between India and Pakistan threatens Beijing’s broader regional interests. As long as India-Pakistan tensions remain under a certain threshold and the hyphenation of the two continues, China has leverage and opportunity. This is because an India that is concerned about dealing with the security threat from Pakistan, or one that is diverting resources and capital to its Western border, is an India that is distracted from the Chinese threat. This threat is not only on the northern and eastern borders but also in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), restricting India’s focus to its continental theater and away from a naval one. So, a low-grade, localized conflict is [not an adverse outcome](https://takshashila.org.in/research/mediation-and-interference-assessing-chinese-views-on-the-latest-india-pakistan-tensions) from China’s perspective. The challenge is escalation to a full-scale war, which impacts its economic and security interests. This is evident from popular Chinese scholars such as Liu Zongyi [arguing](https://www.siis.org.cn/sp/16796.jhtml) for the need to de-escalate. He reasons that if the conflict continues, India would apparently support separatist and extremist groups inside Pakistan and Afghanistan, which threaten internal security and disrupt the CPEC. Consequently, opinion in China supports under-the-threshold methods of keeping the pressure on India alive. These range from seeking an “ [impartial investigation](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/fyrbt_673021/202504/t20250428_11606158.shtml)” to [recounting](https://www.163.com/dy/article/JU8HQV3C0515971M.html?f=post1603_tab_news) India’s defeat in the 1962 war to [amplifying](https://www.guancha.cn/internation/2025_04_27_773832.shtml) Islamabad’s claims of low-lying flooding due to India’s manipulation of the Indus River’s waters. The latter claim is especially unsubstantiated, given that even if there are higher levels of water recorded in Jhelum in the past few days, it is likely a result of the seasonal melting of glaciers—something the Lahore Flood Forecasting Division itself [warned](https://ffd.pmd.gov.pk/bulletin/Advisory) residents of, on April 18. Hence, most of these methods largely carry narrative value and demonstrate China’s unwillingness to be deeply involved in India-Pakistan relations. ### **India’s Move** India’s main challenge is its two-front conundrum. With the Galwan Valley clashes in 2020, the Line of Actual Control (LAC) front with China re-ignited after nearly three decades of relative stability. At that juncture, India and Pakistan had concluded a ceasefire agreement on the Line of Control (LoC). And even though in October 2024, the disengagement process vis-à-vis the friction points along the LAC was completed, de-escalation and de-induction processes remain, and heavy troop and weaponry deployments continue. Today, both the LAC and the LoC are [active hotspots](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinas-other-military-buildup-207113)—a dire security situation that Indian armed forces have not witnessed in quite some time. It imposes on India the strategic imperative to optimize its troop and weapons systems deployment in a way that compromises its capability to respond in neither theater. India continues to be reliant on [Western or Russian defense imports](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/exempt-india-russia-sanctions-202576), even as its self-reliance campaign in the defense sector is progressing gradually. This means that if the conflict with Pakistan drags on, there will be a need to service and secure weapons systems and defense components that can match the strength of Chinese-made Pakistani equipment while also ensuring that both the LAC and the LoC have enough strength to deal with incursions and skirmishes on the ground. The latter should especially consider the [intelligence](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Dec/18/2003615520/-1/-1/0/MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA-2024.PDF) that China continues to deploy heavy weaponry and around [50,000–60,000](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-china-lac-patrolling-arrangements-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri-9631452/) troops along the LAC. India must similarly counter Chinese claims and rhetoric on the international stage. It must make the case that India has a legitimate right to respond to terrorism, and its goal is to end the export of terror by Pakistan. Responsible international actors must understand that there must be zero tolerance for terrorism. Furthermore, since it is not in Beijing’s interests to see the tensions escalate to a hot war, it is important to take note of how Chinese analysts are shaping the public and policymakers’ opinions. Are they disincentivizing India from retaliating to a Pakistani counter-attack, or are they confident in Islamabad’s capabilities? Are they suggesting that China leverage deployment at the LAC to pressure India’s troop presence, which is presently divided between the LAC and the LoC? These are pertinent questions on which India must deliberate. ### **About the Author: Anushka Saxena** [_Anushka Saxena_](https://takshashila.org.in/people/anushka-saxena) _is a staff research analyst for the Indo-Pacific Studies Program at the Takshashila Institution, Bengaluru, India.

(AFP via Getty Images) Back-to-back explosions in New Delhi and Islamabad appear unlikely to trigger imminent Indian or Pakistani retaliation against the other, but severe bilateral mistrust and tensions will sustain the risk of renewed cross-border strikes against targets in major cities should either country determine the other culpable for the recent blasts. On Nov. 11, a suicide bombing killed at least 12 people and injured 36 outside the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. While the Afghanistan-based Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group denied responsibility, a hard-line TTP faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), subsequently claimed the attack and said it targeted \"the judges, lawyers, and other staff who enforce Pakistan's un-Islamic laws.\" Pakistani authorities are still investigating \"all aspects\" of the bombing, though some top officials have suggested it occurred with Indian support, with Pakistan's prime minister attributing the attack to India-backed militants, and the country's interior minister claiming \"Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" were... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

China and India have accused each other of firing shots during a Sept. 7 incident south of Pangong Lake, marking the first official claims of small arms fire on the border since 1975. While the situation in Ladakh had calmed down after the deadly June 15 melee in Galwan Valley, a resurgence of tensions is now occurring in a separate area of the disputed territory. Since Aug. 29, Chinese forces have allegedly been trying to cross into Indian controlled territory in the mountainous area between Pangong and Spanggur Lakes. India reportedly deployed troops to block these Chinese incursion attempts in several separate incidents. ...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures.

In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962.

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders.

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since.
