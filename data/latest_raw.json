Previously, 28 people from the district worked in the Maoist party and their number has come down now because of the efforts being made by the State Government and Bhadradri Kothagudem Police to wean away Maoist’s influence in the district. The family members of the underground Maoists have to take the responsibility of encouraging the Maoists to surrender for leading a normal life. The government provides support for the rehabilitation of surrendered Maoists, the SP said, adding that the Maoist leaders were terrorising innocent tribals and forcing them to join the banned Maoist party to engage them in illegal activities for their selfish interests. Knowingly and unknowingly, some went underground and now find it difficult to join the mainstream of life. **Read less...** | | May - 2 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders are resorting to acts of violence in Bhadradri Kothagudem District of Telangana, said Bhadrachalam, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Paritosh Pankaj, on May 2, reports Telangana Today.

In a statement, ASP Pankaj said, Maoists were committing criminal offences to show their presence and harassing the innocent tribal people of the agency areas. The Naxals \\[Left Wing extremists, LWEs\\] have become obstacles to development. The top leaders of the Maoist party were compelling their lower-level cadres to commit illegal activities with the aim of extorting money and troubling innocent tribals in many ways for their selfish interests. Minor boys and girls were being tortured by the Naxals forcing them to join the Maoist party. The ASP noted that many cadres attracted by the ‘Operation Chayutha’ are planning to surrender, but they were being prevented doing so by Maoist top leadership. **Read less...** | | May - 11 | Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today. In a statement the official said that Maoist top leadership for the wellbeing of their family members have been making the lower ranks scapegoats. Innocent Adivasi youths were being forced to join the Maoist party and giving them arms to attack Police forces. For the selfish needs of Maoists, the lives of Adivasi boys and girls were being spoiled as they were deprived of education. Maoists like Sodi Jogaiah, Rajesh, Sodi Mada and others, killed in encounters, were made to join the Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] when they were minor in age and the party top leadership should take responsibility for their deaths, the SP said. Maoist leaders Damodar, Azad, Aruna and others sending ill-gotten money to their family members but meting out injustice to Adivasi families, which were compelled to sacrifice their children for Maoist leaders, SP, Vineeth noted. **Read less...** | | May - 13 | Drones will be put into service to keep an eye on the movements of the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) in Koraput, Odisha Director General of Police (DGP) Sunil Kumar Bansal said on May 13 during his visit to the district, reports sambadenglish.com.

Previously, operations in **Read more...** Security Forces (SFs) in Bastar are all set to launch ‘Operation Monsoon’ — a major anti-Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) campaign — in the interiors and border areas of the insurgency-hit districts from June to September, reports The Times of India on June 27. Previously, operations in remote and interior areas used to be paused during the rains, inadvertently giving space to Maoists to carry out recruitment drives or hold meetings with villagers. For the past three-four years, however, specially trained units of state and central security forces have pressed on with operations in forests in monsoon, resulting in the killing of 29 Maoists in encounters since 2020. The past years’ operations have been an example against the perceived notion that security forces wouldn’t be able to carry out operations due to overflowing nullahs, canals and slippery terrain in the forests of Bastar, a Police officer said. Bastar range Inspector general of Police (IGP) Sundarraj P told that security camps established in more than 60 spots in the remote areas have “choked the Maoists” and become “bottleneck points” for movement of the insurgents, while giving forces access to the forests. “Earlier, operations would be stalled but for the past 3-4 years, our ops continue during the (rainy) season, bringing results. CRPF \\[Central Reserve Police Force\\], CoBRA \\[Commando Battalion for resolute Action\\] and Special Task Force \\[STF\\] will be carrying out operations as they are well trained in jungle warfare. An action plan is in place to deal with the challenges of monsoon in the forest and conduct searches,” Sundarraj said. The inter-state operations on bordering areas like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra will also be intensified in the coming weeks and the jawans were well equipped for it. The morale of SFs is high despite casualties, the senior Police officer said. “We have recorded significant positive operational outcomes during this monsoon, since we have made decisive inroads into the erstwhile Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] strongholds by opening strategic operational base camps,” said Sundarraj. **Read less...** | | July - 12 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kot **Read more...** The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kothagudem of Telangana on July 12, reports Telangana Today. Jagan called upon the public to revolt against the ‘fascist Brahmanical Hindutva agenda of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of the UCC. As the people’s opposition towards the BJP’s nine-year rule was on the rise, the BJP was planning to execute its divisive and communal agenda. Through the UCC, Hindutva forces want to create a nefarious divisive line based on religion prior to the five state elections and the general election in 2024. In the last nine years of Narendra Modi's rule, the Indian economy has witnessed prolonged stagnation and decline, he said. Poverty, diseases, the gap between the rich and the poor, and attacks on minorities, dalits, and adivasis have reached levels never seen before. More than 800 million people have been pushed below the poverty line. Jagan noted that the BJP was trying to divert all these from the public’s mind. There would be a threat to the religious rights of minorities, tribals, and even Hindus because of the UCC. The BJP was also dehumanising the Muslim community and wrongly projecting them. There was a need to build a mass movement against the UCC, Jagan added. **Read less...** | | July - 13 | The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. The Maoist leaders for whom wanted notices were issued are Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, and Venkata Ravi Chaitanya alias Aruna. In its statement, the NIA said Aruna and Gajarla Ravi are the key executors of the Maoist strategies in Andhra Pradesh. The NIA informed us further that Aruna led the Maoist group that killed the former MLAs. The double murder took place while Kidari Sarveshwara Rao and Siveri Soma were visiting an interior village in the Araku assembly constituency of Andhra Pradesh. NIA re-registered the case on December 6, 2018 and took up the investigation. In June 2021, the NIA filed a supplementary chargesheet in the case against a woman area committee member of the Maoist group. The NIA said the woman Maoist leader, whom they identified as Kalavathi alias Bhavani, was instrumental in providing logistical support to the team that carried out the killing. **Read less...** | | July - 14 | Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Time **Read more...** Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Times of India on July 15. Maharashtra forces, which have already alerted the Central Government about the Maoists trying to bounce back in Chhattisgarh, have put their security and intelligence units on high alert on the stretch between Kanker-Narayanpur and Bijapur national park. A senior official from the security and intelligence wings said around 1,000 cadres have been recruited by the Maoists in Dantewada and Sukma regions. Another 200–250 new cadres were recruited by the Maoists in South Bastar. \"Earlier, there were barely 50–100 cadres in south Bastar and 200–400 in Dantewada and Sukma, which now have swelled to a substantial number after fresh recruitment,\" said the official. He said the concern was that Maoists would regroup and try to bounce back to their former strength in Chhattisgarh, which would not augur well for Gadchiroli and Gondia across the border in Maharashtra. Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) Sandip Patil, also the chief of the Anti-Naxal Operations (ANO) for Maharashtra, said the central government has been briefed about the developments in Chhattisgarh, which may now affect Maharashtra too, but did not divulge further details. \"Maharashtra forces are ready with strategies to counter any fresh threats,\" he said. It’s been learned that the Maoists are planning major attacks on Police posts that the Governments of different states are opening in their strongholds in central India. The Maoists’ ‘technical and research’ wing is said to be developing Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED) to blow them up near Police posts after mounting them on tractors or four-wheelers used in the rural areas.

The anti-Naxal crackdown by the Special Task Force (STF) along with other Security Forces (SFs) has dried up the weapons pipeline, leading to the number of armed extremists dropping drastically in the state, said a senior Police officer. \"Now the Bihar Police, in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and other concerned wings of the government, have intensified their crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui districts in the state\", Sushil Mansingh Khopde, Additional Director General (ADG-operations), STF, said. The ADG said despite law enforcement agencies destroying hundreds of acres of poppy plants each year, inputs suggest that clandestine opium poppy cultivation is present in certain pockets in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts. \"Inputs also suggest that Maoists \\[Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist)\\] have been using opium cultivation as a source of revenue in these areas. They levy a 'tax' on poppy cultivators and small enterprises. Law enforcement agencies destroyed around 600 acres of poppy plantation in these areas in 2021, and in 2022, around 1200 acres were destroyed\", the ADG said, adding, \"The concerned district police and other agencies have been instructed to keep a vigil on clandestine opium poppy cultivation in specific areas in the district.\" Further, ADG Khopde said, \"The number of Maoist-affected districts will further reduce in the coming months. No major Maoist incidents have been reported till June this year. Some armed cadres are only concentrated on the hills of Chakarbandha on the Gaya-Aurangabad border near Jharkhand and in the hilly areas of Jamui and Lakhisarai-Munger.

In a press note issued on November 23, the OSD reminded people that Maoists had issued a statement urging the people to boycott the impending Assembly elections slated for November 30. He, however, reassured the public of the foolproof security arrangements in place to ensure the smooth conduct of the elections. The Maoist action team, reportedly comprising members such as Kunjam Idumal alias Mahender, Kovvasi Ganga alias Mahesh, and others, has reportedly crossed into the Mulugu area with intentions to disrupt the elections. Their strategies allegedly involve targeting security personnel, people’s representatives, political leaders, and officials involved in election duties, instigating fear and chaos among the public. “To combat this threat, Mulugu police have initiated stringent measures, including drone surveillance, cordon search operations, tactical vehicle checks, and area dominance,” the OSD said, emphasizing the grave risk posed by the Maoists to politicians and others, urging the people to remain vigilant and cautious. **Read less...** | | November - 23 | Jharkhand Chief Minister (CM) Hemant Soren, on November 23, declared that the state Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) are in the concluding stages of eliminating Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] menace in the state, reports The Telegraph.

    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#content) Author ### [Pearl Pandya](https://acleddata.com/staff/pearl-pandya) South Asia Research Manager _On 21 May, Indian security forces killed the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI (Maoist)), Nambala Keshava Rao, also known as Basavaraju, in Chhattisgarh state. He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&nbsp;_ _In this Q&A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world._ ## **The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it?** The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed.[1](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote1) So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( _see graph below_). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.[2](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote2) Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts.[3](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote3) Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. Close footnote ## How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also [targeted locals](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/) whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes.[4](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote4) Close footnote ## What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk.[5](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote5) And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so.

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with “unspecified casualties” on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi’s China and Modi’s India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China’s ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China’s abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India’s protest in denying Beijing’s claims as “exaggerated and untenable” is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi’s “clarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat”_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India’s active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China’s nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India’s nuclear strike range_** **_(right) – estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India’s national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China’s “containment of India,” the modernization of the PLA and its “growing assertiveness on the border”, and recommended a shift of India’s national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China’s unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or “string of pearls” that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India’s security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India’s peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China’s energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China’s power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China’s “Malacca dilemma,” by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing’s interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of “the quad”, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing’s ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India’s nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India’s boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India’s dismay. When BRI’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India’s doctrine of “strategic autonomy”. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek “equivalence” with the great powers — China, Russia, US — in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi’s party and support the base’s nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem “techno-nationalism”.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India’s dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India’s military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China’s relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. Commensurate to China’s 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a “peaceful rise” of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world’s longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India’s options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India’s strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India’s preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India’s “Neighborhood First” policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi’s ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal’s stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the “Asian Century” may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India’s geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide “chicken’s neck” connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China’s favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi’s strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India’s advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ”partners” with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh’s deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China’s border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its “like-minded partners” in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India’s diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war – for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India’s irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China’s assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-à-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, “wolf-warrior diplomacy”, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India – the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its “NORMS — New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System” approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India’s quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact – an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China – to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia – India’s soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter’s unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese “iron brother”, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China’s increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India’s disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled. In the _Art of War_, Sun Tzu posits, “a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.”\\[31\\] In their international positioning, whether it will be India or China’s thinking and preparedness that is victorious, only the real geopolitical battle will tell — one that far exceeds the LAC battlegrounds. * * * **References** [_**\\[1\\]**_](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/india-china-standoff-from-precarious-peace-to-the-point-of-no-return/?srsltid=AfmBOorD5qivlKr2EDLlPurrKrB1Tr759R_oZtMzJq_UPkH-xwZw139I#_ednref1) _Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas, New Delhi, November 29, 1996, United Nations Peacemaker, available from_( [https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%20IN\\_961129\\_Agreement%20between%20China%20and%20India.pdf](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%2520IN_961129_Agreement%2520between%2520China%2520and%2520India.pdf)).

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "“I have said in the past that left-wing extremism is the single biggest security challenge to the Indian state. It continues to be so.” – Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.[i] From Ideology To Warfare The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. Resurgence Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. A New Strategy “We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.” -Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. Overruns On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • Used improvised explosive devices. Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • Assassinated officials. In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • Destroyed police infrastructure. Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj Systems Disruption At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? The Deviant Economic Engine “The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.” -Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. The Revolutionary Tax In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. A Revolutionary Tax Economy To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • Mining. Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • Narcotics. India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • Informal tolls. Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. A Strategic Half-Life “It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they look to the Naxals for justice.” –Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base.

It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. Picture source: Depositphotos. _Prospects & Perspectives No. 28_ **The Shadow War: How the Pahalgam Terror Attack Redefined India-China-Pakistan Equation** By _Jagannath Panda_ The Pahalgam [terror attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl) of April 2025, executed by the Pakistan-backed group [The Resistance Front](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473) (TRF), was not merely another episode in the long-running saga of India-Pakistan hostility. It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. By and large, India’s reaction was strong, swift, and assertive beyond the border against the terrorist outfits harbored in Pakistan. The launch of [Operation Sindoor](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473), a precise military response targeting terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC), marked a defining evolution in India’s deterrence doctrine, pointing to a zero-tolerance strategy against terrorism. More than a tactical strike, it was a message — India will respond with resolve, not restraint, when its civilians are attacked. The operation drew clear parallels with the Balakot airstrikes of 2019, yet the context had shifted. The regional climate in 2025 is far more combustible, with trilateral tensions simmering in the Himalayas. The Pahalgam incident has exposed deep-seated fractures in the regional power matrix. China’s strategic posture in the aftermath — marked by conspicuous silence, selective language, and diplomatic hedging — underscores a growing contradiction between its self-styled image as a responsible global power and its operational behavior in South Asia. By refusing to acknowledge the terrorist dimension of such attacks or to pressure its close partner, Pakistan, Beijing reveals a troubling unwillingness to act as a genuine stabilizing force in the region. The contradictions in its stand are only growing and becoming more transparent to the world by the day. Is China truly committed to regional peace and stability, or is it bound by time-worn strategic alignments that prioritize geopolitical advantage over normative responsibility? Can a power that positions itself as an architect of global order afford to undermine its credibility by shielding a state associated with cross-border terrorism? What should be India’s strategic response to this shadow war? **Beijing’s Balancing Act: Neutrality or Strategic Collusion?** Following India’s retaliation, the world watched closely for diplomatic fallout. China’s response was a masterclass in studied ambiguity. Beijing termed India’s military action “ [regrettable](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202505/t20250507_11616523.html)” while conspicuously omitting any condemnation of the terror attack itself. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made [no mention](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/lxjzh/202505/t20250509_11618305.html) of the victims in Pahalgam, nor TRF’s Pakistani connections. Instead, Beijing’s focus remained firmly on urging “restraint” and “dialogue,” echoing a playbook that has often shielded Islamabad from international censure. This is not entirely a new behavior on the part of the Chinese leadership. Beijing has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the UN Security Council to [block designations of known terrorists](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slams-china-at-un-for-blocking-move-to-designate-2611-accused-sajid-mir-as-global-terrorist/article66993043.ece) based in Pakistan, including Sajid Mir, a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander involved in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008. This pattern of diplomatic protection underscores China’s strategic calculus: Pakistan is more than an ally — it is a linchpin in Beijing’s South Asia strategy and a buffer against Indian regional ascendency. What makes China’s stance especially problematic is its persistent refusal to differentiate between India’s counterterrorism actions and aggressive behavior. Chinese state media and official discourse frequently conflate Indian responses along the LoC with assertive conduct along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), crafting a narrative in which India is portrayed as a regional aggressor. This distortion allows Beijing to simultaneously align with Pakistan’s security outlook while maintaining a superficial neutrality. Moreover, China’s behavior mirrors its broader geopolitical approach: internal threats such as “Uyghur separatism” are met with uncompromising state violence, while external threats that affect neighbors like India are compartmentalized or ignored. The selective outrage is a window into Beijing’s dual standards on terrorism and state sovereignty. **Proxy Wars and Silent Partners: Redrawing the Diplomatic Map** Beyond the rhetoric, Beijing’s alignment with Pakistan is rooted in hard interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the crown jewel of Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This infrastructure project is not just about roads and pipelines — it’s about strategic depth. Any Indian challenge to the territorial status quo threatens both Pakistan’s and China’s investments, thereby sealing the logic of Beijing’s indirect complicity. This complicity extends into the diplomatic arena. In multilateral forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China has consistently [blocked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/human-rights-must-be-respected-india-after-skipping-xinjiang-vote/articleshow/94713915.cms) Indian attempts to highlight Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism. Instead, China promotes counterterrorism frameworks that align neatly with its own domestic narratives, especially those concerning Xinjiang, while conveniently avoiding issues that implicate Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues its [strategic silence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/22/asia/imran-khan-xinjiang-axios-intl-hnk) on China’s repression of Uyghur Muslims, despite its self-styled image as a champion of the Islamic world. This tacit exchange of blind spots — on terrorism and human rights — has become the bedrock of the Sino-Pakistani axis. And India, despite walking a tightrope on sensitive Chinese issues like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, has received no reciprocation in the form of diplomatic neutrality or support. The geopolitical geometry is clear: while India and Pakistan battle over borders and ideology, China plays the dual role of facilitator and firewall for Islamabad. Whether in backchannel diplomacy or in global institutions, China consistently acts to dilute pressure on Pakistan, reinforcing a strategic triangle that disadvantages New Delhi at every turn. Beijing’s deliberate omission of Pakistani provocations and cross-border violence in its Operation Sindoor response press briefings suggests a calculated strategic posture. This silence reflects China’s continued alignment with Pakistan, indicating that broader geopolitical considerations outweigh any immediate concerns about regional instability. By not publicly addressing Islamabad’s role, China signals its intent to preserve and prioritize its long-standing strategic partnership with Pakistan. **A Call for India’s Strategic Realignment** In this increasingly tangled web of interests, India must reassess its China doctrine. The idea of Beijing as a potential stabilizer in South Asia has little basis in reality. Instead, China has shown a consistent willingness to prioritize its strategic partnerships and investments over regional peace or normative alignment against terrorism. One avenue for India is to adopt a strategy of normative reciprocity. If China insists on referring to Jammu and Kashmir as a “disputed territory,” India could begin more openly addressing Chinese sensitive issues, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and potentially even Taiwan, revisiting its “One China” policy. Until now, India has largely upheld a principle of “mutual sensitivity” regarding core sovereignty concerns. While China has been increasingly assertive in internationalizing the Kashmir issue — whether through UN Security Council interventions, statements aligning with Pakistan, or selective cartographic provocations — India has avoided reciprocal commentary on China’s sensitive regions. This asymmetric restraint has allowed China to shape narratives unchallenged, while denying India the same deference on issues central to its national unity. Engaging Taiwan more openly — especially on trade, technology, and democratic solidarity — aligns India with other democracies like the U.S., Japan, and parts of Europe that have gradually normalized unofficial ties. Strengthening ties with Taiwan also offers India access to high-end manufacturing, especially in semiconductors, where Taiwan’s TSMC dominates global supply chains, critical for India’s tech and defense sectors. A closer India-Taiwan dynamic could be used as part of a broader Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance Chinese assertiveness in the region, especially when coupled with defense dialogues like the Quad. Explicit moves on Taiwan would likely provoke strong diplomatic and possibly economic retaliation from Beijing. This could take the form of border pressure along the LAC, trade restrictions, or cyber disruptions. Any move on Taiwan would have more impact if coordinated with partners like the U.S., Japan, or Australia. A unilateral shift may yield limited strategic gain while exposing India to disproportionate costs. It is therefore imperative that India must continue to invest more robustly in multilateral and minilateral coalitions that exclude or counterbalance China, such as the Quad, the India-Japan-Australia trilateral, and enhanced EU engagements. India’s aspiration to be recognized as a major international power, including in the “Global South,” depends not solely on its material capabilities but also on its normative influence, particularly in shaping global discourses on terrorism. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, New Delhi may need to recalibrate its approach by intensifying collaboration with global norm entrepreneurs, including middle powers across Europe and Asia, as well as transnational civil society and multilateral institutions. Moreover, India’s leadership roles in forums such as the G20 and BRICS present strategic platforms through which it can reframe regional security narratives and assert its vision for counterterrorism norms. Domestically, India must prepare for the long haul. The possibility of a coordinated two-front scenario — with Pakistan engaging in asymmetric warfare through proxy actors and irregular tactics and China providing strategic and diplomatic cover — is no longer hypothetical. Preparing for this evolving threat environment requires India to adopt a comprehensive and long-term security posture, encompassing military modernization, institutional resilience, and societal preparedness. Enhancing border infrastructure, upgrading intelligence and surveillance capabilities, and fortifying strategic deterrence must be non-negotiables in India’s defense roadmap. Sustaining a prolonged state of readiness requires a resilient defense-industrial base, robust supply chains, and financial planning. India must continue reforms to reduce dependence on foreign arms imports, incentivize indigenous R&D, and create strategic reserves for critical materials. Further, building robust logistical networks, especially in border states and high-altitude regions, will improve troop mobility and sustain long-term deployments. Civil-military synergy in infrastructure projects such as roads, airfields, and telecommunications along both western and eastern frontiers is essential. The shifting threat landscape demands that India move beyond reactive postures. Both Pakistan and China are adept at leveraging information warfare and disinformation to influence public opinion and sow discord. India must invest in counter-disinformation capacities, strategic communication, and public awareness campaigns to build regional and societal resilience against foreign psychological operations, where Taiwan could emerge as a stronger partner. New Delhi must significantly enhance its capabilities in narrative warfare — a strategic effort to shape perceptions, control the discourse, and influence international opinion. This involves not only countering adversarial narratives but also proactively framing its own story in a manner that resonates with global audiences. India’s case against Pakistan-based terrorism, as well as China’s tacit support through diplomatic silence or selective framing, must be articulated with clarity, credibility, and moral authority. To be effective, this narrative must be disseminated across multiple global platforms — from the United Nations and international media to think tanks, academic forums, and digital diplomacy channels — to expose the regional destabilizing roles of both Pakistan and China, and to align international sentiment with India’s security concerns and normative positions. The decision to send [delegations](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seven-all-party-delegations-to-take-indias-message-against-terrorism-to-key-partner-nations-government/article69586448.ece) to 32 nations is a strong first step. Publishing credible evidence, such as satellite imagery, financial trail disclosures, or intercepted communications, can further strengthen the factual basis of India’s narrative and pre-empt counterclaims. **Conclusion: Pahalgam as a Turning Point** The Pahalgam terrorist attack will be remembered not just for its human toll, but for what it revealed about the shifting tectonics of regional power complexities. It was a moment of clarity: India is not just facing a belligerent neighbor in Pakistan, but also contending with a cunning and double-standard power in China that is willing to obscure terrorism behind the veil of strategic self-interest. Increasingly, China’s actions — or calculated inactions — are rendering its strategic contradictions more visible to the international community, challenging the coherence of its South Asia policy and weakening its claim to impartiality in regional conflict resolution. The path ahead for India requires more than conventional military readiness; it calls for a fundamental reassessment of the strategic assumptions underpinning India's approach to China, particularly regarding Beijing’s role in shaping, enabling, or deferring regional crises. New Delhi’s challenge is two-fold. It must deter asymmetric threats from across the border, and it must decode and counteract the quieter, more insidious enablers of that threat. That means not just stronger borders, but sharper diplomacy. Not just better arms, but better arguments. Narrative warfare, if conducted strategically, allows India not just to defend its position but to shape the global agenda on terrorism and regional order, reinforcing its claim to normative leadership as a rising power. Pahalgam may have been a tragedy for India, but it is also an inflection point. A new foreign policy realism must follow. Because in this geopolitical theatre, the shadows are as dangerous as the swords.

India has seen a sharp rise in cyberattacks over the last few years, which has turned data protection into a top security concern. According to **CERT-IN,** between **2021 and mid-2025,** India recorded more than **2.2 million** cybersecurity incidents, averaging more than **3,000 attacks per day,** with financial services, healthcare, telecom, and government platforms among the hardest hit. Hackers focused on cloud misconfigurations, unpatched servers, and weak internal access controls. The list below tracks **25 major cyberattacks in India** from 2021 to 2025, showing how they happened and what strategies can be used to prevent similar breaches. ## **1\\. Angel One AWS resource breach/potential data leakage, February 2025** Angel One, India's largest broking firm, was recently hacked. Hackers gained access to an unsecured AWS storage bucket linked to it, exposing the sensitive data of **7.9 million** users, such as trading details, email addresses, and customer IDs. Cloud management made sensitive data visible on public servers. To avoid such scams, similar companies must audit all cloud buckets, enable encryption, and always restrict public access through IAM (Identity and Access Management) rules. ## **2\\. AI-generated Phishing and Infostealer Surge, 2025** In 2025, several Indian banks and fintech platforms reported a rise in AI-generated phishing scams. Attackers used a realistic, AI-written email to fool users into giving away credentials. Thousands have already fallen victim to these smarter phishing campaigns by unknowingly entering their bank credentials, leading to financial losses and identity theft. Attackers also used voice cloning and deepfake technology to impersonate officials, which makes the deception look more convincing. One must consider the fact that constant user training, spam filters, and AI-based email scanning tools block most phishing messages before they reach inboxes. ## **3\\. Aditya Birla Capital Digital (ABCD) App Hack, 2025** Hackers targeted a weakness in the ABCD mobile app API, revealing customers' loan and PAN details. The attackers targeted unprotected endpoints, which allows data scraping. API vulnerabilities remain a growing concern for finance apps. However, routine code audits with secure token validation and regular app updates can stop such data exposure. ## **4\\. Star Health Threats, May 2025** Star Health, one of India's largest health insurers, experienced a major data breach that affected 31 million policyholders; much of the core information, including medical records, insurance details, and personal information, was breached and even published on the dark web. This breach shows how healthcare data can be exploited for identity theft. Encrypting health records, segmenting sensitive systems, and ensuring continuous monitoring can reduce such risks. ## **5\\. Delhi Hospitals Ransomware Attack, June 2025** Delhi's **Sant Parmanand** and **NKS Super Speciality** hospitals were targeted by ransomware that locked almost all patient and billing data. Over **60,000 records** were affected by this attack. The attack used phishing emails to deliver ransomware payloads. The malware spread quickly through unprotected hospital networks. Hospitals should isolate administrative and patient data systems, train staff to identify suspicious emails, and maintain offline data backups. ## **6\\. Kolkata Police Cyber Crime Wing Data Breach, August 2025** Weak internal passwords and a lack of access control allowed hackers to access internal police systems, where investigation details from the Cyber Wing in Kolkata were leaked. This breach exposed officer credentials and case data. The attack raised alarms about insider threats and the need for stronger law enforcement cybersecurity. Police and law enforcement agencies should adopt role-based access control, enforce password rotations, and enable two-factor authentication for internal systems. ## **7\\. Multiple Cyberattacks on Indian Governments, 2024.** Multiple state e-governance portals were hacked in 2024, leaking citizen Aadhaar and bank details. At least **2.5 million** records were compromised across several platforms. Many portals lacked basic HTTPS encryption, which allowed attackers to exploit outdated plugins and weak admin passwords. That's why regular CMS updates, secure admin logins, and government-wide cybersecurity policies are vital for protection. Every e-governance platform must undergo quarterly vulnerability assessments and follow a national cybersecurity standard to protect public data. ## **8\\. Polycab Ransomware Attack, March 2024** Polycab India, a top cable manufacturer, suffered a ransomware attack, causing a **Rs 20 crore** operational loss. The breach started from an infected employee workstation and ended with hackers encrypting internal files and demanding high payments. The attack also affected the supplier and distributor network, exposing the ripple effect of industrial cyber incidents. ## **9\\. Indian Energy Sector Attack, 2024** This breach shows the exposure of operational technology systems, where hackers tried to infiltrate India's power grid through malware-infected email attachments sent to energy employees. The attack aimed to disrupt the electricity supply but was quickly contained. **Tip:** Separating IT and OT networks and constantly monitoring power infrastructure can prevent major outages like this. Moreover, conducting red team simulations and regular cybersecurity drills helps reduce the chance of large-scale blackouts. ## **10\\. BSNL Data Breach, May 2024** Personal details of **2.9 million** broadband subscribers were leaked from a BSNL database due to old, unpatched systems. Leaked data included phone numbers and service details. The breach came from a neglected internal server. The outdated system, left without proper monitoring, became an easy entry point. Updating infrastructure and restricting admin access can prevent similar service providers. **Read Also: [Top 30 Best-Known Cybersecurity Case Studies 2025](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-best-known-cybersecurity-case-studies)** ## **11\\. UP Marriage Assistance Scheme Leak, 2024** The Uttar Pradesh Marriage Assistance Scheme is a welfare initiative aimed at helping low-income families. Data from the welfare portal of Uttar Pradesh leaked, including Aadhaar, bank details, and contact information, affecting **200,000** applicants. The data was found indexed on search engines, shockingly. The root cause was traced to poor web server configuration and missing access restrictions. A web firewall and regular penetration testing could have prevented this from happening. ## **12\\. Airtel India Customer Database Leak (375 Million Users), June 2024** Hackers claimed to sell a database of **375 million** users, which would be nearly **25%** of India's population. Airtel denied the break, but the data was widely shared online. The leak included Aadhaar numbers and personal details. Even if false, it revealed risks from third-party data handling. Telecom companies must run vendor audits and apply zero-trust security across all databases, anonymising customer data wherever possible to reduce exposure if leaks occur. ## **13\\. WazirX Hack, July 2024** Crypto firms must use cold wallets for storage and conduct third-party code audits before deploying smart contracts. WazirX, a crypto exchange, was targeted by hackers who were exploiting blockchain smart contract vulnerabilities. Roughly **$230 million** worth of assets were at risk. This breach clearly highlights that public blockchain code, if left unaudited, can create hidden backdoors. ## **14\\. boAt India Data Breach, 2023** Encrypting user data and applying hashed passwords are key to securing e-commerce databases. In 2023, an unsecured server was recently exposed, exposing **7.5 million** customer records, including names and contact information. The leak spread on Telegram and hacking forums. Weak password protection made recovery even harder. Many users later reported spam calls and targeted ads due to leaked data. ## **15\\. Telangana Police's Hawk Eye App Data Breach, 2023** Hackers accessed the Hawk Eye mobile app, revealing user profiles and feedback reports. The app, meant for citizen safety, accidentally exposed personal data through a misconfigured API. Public-facing government apps should use token-based access, secure API gateways and regular security reviews before each software update. **Read Also: [Top 50 Cyber Security Projects for Final Year Students (2025 Edition)](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-25-cyber-security-projects-for-final-year-students)** ## **16\\. Hyundai Motor India Data Leak, 2023** Thousands of car owners whose contact and vehicle details were stolen were found on the dark web. The source of the breach was traced to a third-party vendor responsible for managing the dealer's database. Weak vendor access controls and outdated security measures worsened the system, risking identity misuse because the data appeared on dark web forums for sale. ## **17\\. SPARSH Data Breach, 2023** The Ministry of Defence's SPARSH portal suffered a breach, which exposed pensioner IDs and bank details. Hackers used credential stuffing techniques on weak passwords. This breach raised national security concerns as the portal handled sensitive military data. Multi-factor authentication, stronger password policies, and regular login behaviour analysis can stop similar attacks. ## **18\\. Sun Pharma Cyber Attack, 2023** Pharmaceutical giant Sun Pharma's ransomware disrupted its internal operations and supply chain, causing **Rs. 30 crore** in losses. Hackers entered through a phishing email and encrypted internal servers. Companies should train employees to identify phishing attempts, install anti-ransomware software, and maintain offline data backups for rapid recovery. ## **19\\. BharatPe Hacked: August 2022** Phishing emails led to a breach of employees' inboxes, leaking internal documents and financial reports. The attackers used social engineering to mimic trusted contacts, tricking employees into sharing login credentials. While no customer data was stolen, the breach hurt investor confidence. Using email MFA, spam filters, and awareness campaigns can block future phishing attempts. ## **20\\. Cyberattack on AIIMS: December 2022** India's top hospital, AIIMS, suffered a ransomware attack that took **3 million** patient records. The servers remained slow for approximately two weeks, which caused major disruption. **Read Also: [The Rise of Agentic AI in Cyber Warfare: Implications for Global Security](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/the-rise-of-agentic-ai-in-cyber-warfare-implications-for-global-security)** ## **21\\. CloudSEK Data Breach: December 2022** In 2022, hackers stole internal data from the cybersecurity firm CloudSEK and exposed API keys on **GitHub.** The breach revealed how even security companies can be vulnerable. Never use credentials in code repositories, and rotate all access tokens regularly. ## **22\\. Swachhta Platform Hacked, September 2022** Hackers breached India's Swachh Bharat (Clean India) platform, a government site that collected public sanitation feedback and cleanliness reports. The attackers took advantage of outdated CMS plugins and weak credentials, allowing them to deface the homepage and delete parts of the citizen feedback database. ## **23\\. Zivame Data Breach, 2022** In 2022, Indian lingerie retailer Zivame experienced an excessive data breach exposing personal and transactional information of nearly **1.5 million** customers. The data included names, phone numbers, email addresses and partially masked payment records. Investigators traced the cause to an unsecured database server left open to the public without password protection. The leaked dataset appeared later on dark web forums for sale. ## **24\\. Air India / SITA Passenger Data Breach, 2021** Recently, in 2021, a global cyberattack on SITA, the IT provider for various airlines, exposed personal data of over **4.5 million** Air India passengers, which included passport details, ticket numbers, birth dates, and contact information. The breach was traced to unauthorised access in SITA's passenger service system, which connected multiple airlines worldwide, compromising long-term passenger privacy. That's why airlines and travel companies must vet all external vendors for compliance with strict cybersecurity standards, enforce encryption for shared databases and deploy continuous threat detection across connected systems. ## **25\\. Domino's India Customer Data Leak, 2021** Hackers exposed nearly **180 million** customer order details, including their names, phone numbers and even GPS coordinates. Attackers used an unsecured server within the company's order-tracking infrastructure, and later they published the full dataset on the dark web. The exposed location information was essentially alarming, as it could reveal customers' routines and residential details. Companies handling location-based services should encrypt all customer data, mask stored addresses and set strict retention periods for order records. **Read Also: [Zero Trust Security: The Future of Cyber Defense](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/zero-trust-security-the-future-of-cyber-defense)** ## **In the End** India's cybersecurity reflects both rapid progress and rising exposure. Attackers have now shifted to multi-stage ransomware, insider misuse, and AI-generated phishing. Organisations that invested early in zero-trust controls, employee awareness programmes, and regular threat monitoring have contained incidents faster and have limited damage. Every sector, private or public, must treat cybersecurity as an **operational priority** rather than a compliance task tied to reputation, customer trust, and business continuity. ## **Frequently Asked Questions** ### **Which sector faces the most cyber threats in India?** The financial, healthcare, telecom and e-commerce sectors top the list due to their high data value. Banking APIs, digital payment apps, and hospital systems are common ransomware and credential theft targets. ### **What are the main reasons behind the rise in cyberattacks in India?** The main reasons are rapid digitisation, weak password habits, over-reliance on cloud storage without proper encryption, and phishing campaigns using AI-written messages. ### **How can individuals protect themselves from data leaks in India?** Use unique passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, avoid public Wi-Fi for banking, and never click unknown links in SMS or WhatsApp messages.

Shah](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/kriti-m-shah) _The citizens’ right to protest is a pillar of Indian democracy. While citizens are allowed to peacefully assemble, however, protests and demonstrations sometimes take a violent turn; recent examples are the Jat protests in Haryana and the Kashmir unrest following the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, both in 2016. During such occasions, it is the prerogative of the Indian state to deal with the violent civil protests in a manner that ensures public order and protects citizens from harm. This paper discusses the use of force by security officials during periods of violent civil unrest and seeks to understand the ways and means of dealing with such protests in the country._ ## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

Pakistani hackers attacked 1.5 million-plus Indian websites after Operation Sindoor: Failure rate, names of 7 Pakistani hacker groups; techniques used and more [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Oct 13, 2025, 14:23 IST Share AA + **Text Size** - Small - Medium - Large Following the Pahalgam terror strike, Maharashtra Cyber identified seven APT groups, primarily Pakistan-allied, responsible for over 1.5 million cyber attacks targeting critical Indian infrastructure. While only 150 attacks succeeded, these groups employed malware, DDoS attacks, and misinformation campaigns. The attacks originated from Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Middle East, and Indonesia, with some successful defacements and alleged data theft. Representational AI image Maharashtra Cyber has reportedly identified seven Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups responsible for launching over 15 lakh cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure websites across India following the Pahalgam terror strike. Of these, only 150 attacks were successful, officials said, as per a report by news agency PTI. This means a failure rate of 99.99% or should one say abysmal success rate of 0.01%.In a report titled \"Road of Sindoor\", prepared under the military operation launched by the Indian armed forces under the same name against terrorists, the state's nodal cyber agency has detailed the cyber warfare launched by Pakistan-allied hacking groups. The report has been submitted to all key law enforcement agencies, including the Director General of Police and the State Intelligence Department.According to the report, these cyber attacks originated from Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Middle East, and an Indonesian group, said Yashasvi Yadav, Additional Director General of Police, Maharashtra Cyber. ## India-Pakistan Ceasefire has not stopped Pakistani hackers Even after India and Pakistan reached an understanding to stop military hostilities, Indian government websites are facing a barrage of cyber attacks from the neighbouring country as well as from Bangladesh and the Middle Eastern region, they said.\"The probe discovered that cyber attacks on (government websites in) India decreased after India-Pakistan ceased hostilities, but not fully stopped. These attacks continue from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Morocco, and Middle Eastern countries,\" he said.Pakistani hackers bringing down websites of major airports in India, Election Commission and ...Addressing reporters, a senior official of Maharashtra Cyber debunked claims of hackers stealing data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai, hacking aviation and municipal systems, and targeting the Election Commission website. ## Techniques used by Pakistani hackers The methods used by hackers included malware campaigns, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and GPS spoofing. The defacement of Indian websites was also reported. He said many such attacks were thwarted, and critical infrastructure of India was saved.The report also highlights a hybrid warfare strategy by Pakistan-allied groups that includes widespread misinformation campaigns. These groups falsely claimed to have hacked India's banking system and caused power outages. These false narratives included claims of cyber attacks on India's power grid, statewide blackouts, satellite jamming, disruption of the Northern Command, and an alleged attack on a BrahMos missile storage facility, Yadav said.Maharashtra Cyber identified and removed over 5,000 instances of misinformation and fake news related to India-Pakistan military conflicts that were circulating on social media. ## 7 Pakistani Hacker groups that attacked Indian websites The seven hacking groups identified in the report are APT 36 (Pakistan-based), Pakistan Cyber Force, Team Insane PK, Mysterious Bangladesh, Indo Hacks Sec, Cyber Group HOAX 1337, and National Cyber Crew (Pakistan-allied). These groups collectively launched approximately 1.5 million targeted cyber attacks on Indian infrastructure, Yadav said. ## The Indian websites Pakistani hackers brought down Among the 150 successful attacks, the Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council website was defaced. The attackers also claimed to have stolen data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), as well as from telecom companies, with some of the data allegedly appearing on the darknet. Additionally, the website of the Defence Nursing College in Jalandhar was defaced. **About the Author** [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) The TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

    "full_text": "Author : [Soumya Awasthi](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/soumya-awasthi) ###### [**Expert Speak**](https://www.orfonline.org/content-type/expert-speak) [Raisina Debates](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak-category/raisina-debates-review) ##### Published on **Oct 14, 2025** > _APT36’s targeting of India’s BOSS Linux system reveals the expanding scope of Pakistan’s cyber-espionage operations, underscoring the urgent need for India to strengthen its digital defence architecture._ Following Operation Sindoor, the Pakistan-linked threat group APT36, also known as Transparent Tribe, has [targeted India’s Bharat Operating System Solutions](https://sundayguardianlive.com/news/pakistan-linked-cyber-espionage-group-targets-indian-institutions-137611/) (BOSS) Linux [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/www.orfonline.org#_ftn1) operating system numerous times. This marks a significant departure from the group’s usual playbook, which has been centred on Windows-centric malware and spear-phishing lures. By expanding its reach to compromise BOSS Linux, a system widely adopted by Indian government entities, APT36 is signalling not merely a technical upgrade but a deliberate escalation on the cyber-espionage front in the India-Pakistan rivalry. APT36’s targeting of BOSS Linux indicates a calculated attempt to undermine confidence in this indigenous platform. A successful breach not only grants access to sensitive communications and classified data but also erodes institutional faith in self-reliant technological ecosystems. This outcome serves Pakistan’s interests on multiple levels: tactically, by harvesting intelligence; and strategically, by discrediting India’s efforts at digital autonomy. > By expanding its reach to compromise BOSS Linux, a system widely adopted by Indian government entities, APT36 is signalling not merely a technical upgrade but a deliberate escalation on the cyber-espionage front in the India-Pakistan rivalry. The discovery of this campaign underscores an uncomfortable reality: Pakistan-based cyber actors, often operating under the aegis of state agencies or enjoying tacit state protection, are evolving their capabilities beyond low-level phishing attacks into strategically targeted, cross-platform espionage operations. This trend holds profound implications for India’s national security, not least because it compromises trust in indigenous technologies developed as alternatives to foreign software ecosystems. ## Anatomy of the New Campaign The latest intrusion by APT36 begins with a familiar vector, spear-phishing emails. Camouflaged as official government correspondence, these emails deliver compressed archives containing malicious desktop files. Unlike traditional Windows executables, these shortcuts are designed explicitly for Linux environments and crafted to resemble innocuous PDF files. When executed, the desktop file triggers a [series of covert commands](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments) embedded in its Exec field. Utilities such as ‘curl’ and ‘xxd’ are then employed to fetch a hex-encoded payload from [attacker-controlled infrastructure](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments), decode it, and silently deploy it under the temporary directory. With execution rights granted, [the payload operates silently](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments) in the background, all while the user is distracted by a decoy PDF opened in parallel. > Forensic evidence suggests a Pakistan state-backed effort, given the substantial resources expended on developing BOSS Linux-specific attack chains and maintaining redundant infrastructure. The campaign is more than an opportunistic strike; it is an assault on India’s technological sovereignty. Persistence is achieved by ensuring that the [malware relaunches upon every login.](https://cloudsek.com/blog/investigation-report-apt36-malware-campaign-using-desktop-entry-files-and-google-drive-payload-delivery) Its communications are funnelled to command-and-control (C2) nodes and the newly registered domain, both of which reflect a carefully coordinated campaign. Forensic evidence suggests a Pakistan state-backed effort, given the substantial resources expended on developing [BOSS Linux-specific attack chains and maintaining redundant infrastructure](https://teamwin.in/apt36-hackers-attacking-indian-boss-linux-systems-with-weaponized-desktop-shortcut-files/#:~:text=The%20digital%20defense%20perimeter%20of,deliver%20and%20execute%20malicious%20payloads.). The campaign is more than an opportunistic strike; it is an assault on India’s technological sovereignty. ## Pakistan’s Cyber-Espionage Landscape [Pakistan-supported hacking groups](https://cyble.com/threat-actor-profiles/transparenttribe/) collectively serve Islamabad’s strategic agenda. [APT 36, also known as Transparent Tribe](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/apt-profile-transparent-tribe-aka-apt36/), is primarily focused on cyber espionage against the Indian government, targeting Indian defence personnel, diplomatic missions, and critical infrastructure. Its preferred tactics have included malware-laden documents, watering-hole attacks, and social engineering through fake recruitment portals. There have been reports of a [link between other APT-based groups](https://cybersrcc.com/2025/05/02/pakistan-linked-sidecopy-hackers-escalate-indian-cyberattacks-with-curlback-rat-and-spark-rat/#:~:text=SideCopy%20is%20a%20Pakistan%2Dlinked,and%20now%2C%20critical%20infrastructure%20sectors.), such as [SideCopy, SideWinder](https://cyble.com/threat-actor-profiles/transparenttribe/), and [TransparentTribe](https://socradar.io/dark-web-profile-apt36/). These groups often share infrastructure, malware families, or operational overlaps, suggesting either coordination or common direction by Pakistan’s intelligence services, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). ## A Global Nexus: Pakistan Supporting Hackers Beyond Borders While India remains the principal target, Pakistan-based hackers have extended their reach internationally, either independently or in collaboration with other state-linked actors. Several examples illustrate this global dimension. For instance, in 2021, soon after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, Pakistan-linked hackers engaged in a campaign [against Afghan government](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-says-hackers-from-pakistan-targeted-people-in-the-previous-afghan-government/article37537222.ece) and civil society networks, consolidating Islamabad’s influence and monitoring rival factions. Similarly, there have been reported overlaps between Pakistani hacker groups and [campaigns affecting Gulf states](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/saudi-arabia-uae-face-brunt-apt-cyber-attacks-middle-east-threatcop-gwecc/), particularly those hosting large Indian diasporas. Espionage here has dual value: monitoring Indian activities abroad and gaining leverage with Gulf governments. Security firms have observed occasional alignment between Pakistani actors and broader anti-Western cyber campaigns, some with tacit [Chinese or Iranian involvement](https://www.indiandefensenews.in/2025/06/chinas-support-for-pakistan-and-iran.html#:~:text=Tuesday%2C%20June%2017%2C%202025%20by,desire%20to%20counterbalance%20Western%20influence.). These collaborations may be opportunistic rather than formal. Still, they indicate a willingness on the part of Pakistani hackers to position themselves as part of the global anti-Western cyber-espionage ecosystem. > As India promotes platforms like BOSS Linux, there should be a mandatory and more rigorous security certification framework led by CERT-In, DRDO, and the National Informatics Centre (NIC). In essence, Pakistan has fostered an environment where state priorities, cybercrime networks, and ideological motivations blur into a hybrid threat matrix. The state benefits from plausible deniability while reaping the intelligence dividends of global cyber operations. ## **Evolution of Capabilities** Over the past decade, Pakistan-based hackers have evolved from low-level disruptors into sophisticated cyber-espionage actors. Between 2010 and 2014, their operations primarily involved [website defacements](https://www.idsa.in/publisher/issuebrief/digital-war-pakistans-cyber-activity-against-india), online propaganda, and basic [phishing attacks](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/apt36-a-phishing-campaign-targeting-indian-government-entities/#:~:text=An%20investigation%20into%20the%20domain%20revealed%20a%20notable%20connection%20to,targeting%20of%20Indian%20government%20entities.) aimed at embarrassing Indian institutions. From 2015 to 2019, groups like [APT36 matured technically](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/apt36-refines-tools-attacks-indian-targets#:~:text=APT36%20Refines%20Tools%20in%20Attacks%20on%20Indian%20Targets%20APT36%20Refines,Step%2Dby%2DStep%20Cyberattack%20Capability), shifting toward credential theft, malware infiltration, and sustained surveillance of India’s defence and diplomatic networks. The period 2020 to 2024 marked a cross-platform expansion, with Pakistan-linked actors [developing Android malware](https://therecord.media/android-malware-alleged-pakistan-espionage-campaign-india#:~:text=Android%20malware%20used%20in%20six,logs%20and%20delete%20all%20contacts.) targeting Indian military personnel through fake applications and deploying advanced Windows-based trojans with layered obfuscation. By 2025, the focus had moved to Linux-specific targeting, particularly against India’s indigenous BOSS Linux system. This development signals dedicated research capacity and a state-backed commitment to penetrating critical digital infrastructure. Such a trajectory reflects Pakistan’s transition from a nuisance-level cyber actor to a structured, strategic, and offensive one that directly threatens India’s technological and national security landscape. ## Strategic Implications for India The attack on India’s BOSS Linux should not be viewed as an isolated cyber incident but as part of a broader transnational security challenge unfolding in the grey zone of hybrid warfare. Pakistan’s strategy has long employed a blend of conventional, sub-conventional, and informational tools to weaken India’s security architecture, and cyber operations now represent its newest frontier. > Given that India has one of the most advanced IT ecosystems and that private Indian cybersecurity companies have been able to track cyberattacks — particularly those targeting defence technology, finance, and telecommunications — more swiftly, there is a need for greater synergy between private and government agencies. By targeting BOSS Linux, an indigenous operating system central to India’s drive for technological self-reliance, Pakistan-linked actors are staging an attack on India’s digital sovereignty. Beyond espionage, such operations enable adversaries to penetrate government systems on a large scale, intercepting sensitive policy, defence, and diplomatic communications that could influence decision-making during crises. In times of tension or limited conflict, pre-positioned malware could be activated to paralyse communication channels, interfere with logistics, or disrupt essential services, achieving strategic disruption without crossing the threshold of open war. In this sense, the targeting of BOSS Linux is symbolic of how the digital domain has become an extension of the battlefield, where state and proxy actors engage India in an unceasing contest for advantage in the grey zone. ## Defensive Priorities for India India must adopt a multi-layered, adaptive defence posture to counter the evolving threat landscape. 1. **_Mandate Indigenous Security Certification for Government Software_** **_:_** As India promotes platforms like BOSS Linux, there should be a mandatory and more rigorous security certification framework led by CERT-In, DRDO, and the National Informatics Centre (NIC). All open-source or indigenous software adopted by the government must undergo regular red-teaming, vulnerability audits, and penetration testing, with the results feeding into an early-warning repository. 2. **_Promote Public–Private Collaboration for Threat Intelligence Sharing_** **_:_** Given that India has one of the most advanced IT ecosystems and that private Indian cybersecurity companies have been able to track cyberattacks — particularly those targeting defence technology, finance, and telecommunications — more swiftly, there is a need for greater synergy between private and government agencies. Creating a secure national platform for the real-time exchange of threat data between government and industry would enhance situational awareness and facilitate early mitigation. 3. **_Create a ‘Trusted Digital Ecosystem’ Policy_** **_:_** Taking forward the country’s ‘Make in India’ mission, agencies overseeing the cybersecurity industry should promote a secure supply chain for hardware and software used in critical infrastructure. This includes regulating the import of networking equipment, mandating transparency in source code for government procurement, incentivising local cybersecurity start-ups, overcoming obstacles like No Cost, No Commitment (NCNC), and ensuring the start-ups do not migrate to Western countries. 4. **_Institutionalise Continuous Training and Capacity Building_** **_:_** A national programme for “Cybersecurity Literacy and Leadership” should be created for civil servants, military officers, and policymakers. 5. **_Develop a Strategic Cyber Deterrence Doctrine_** **_:_** India should articulate a formal doctrine defining how cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, government systems, or defence networks would be interpreted under national security law. Establishing clear thresholds for proportional responses — whether diplomatic, economic, or cyber-retaliatory — can serve as a deterrent to persistent actors like APT36. 6. **_Establish a National Cyber Command_** **_:_** Cyber threats should be treated not merely as technical incidents but as instruments of hybrid warfare. Therefore, the government and military must upgrade the Defence Cyber Agency to a Command-level body and formulate a holistic mechanism for securing national cyberspace. ## Conclusion The exploitation of BOSS Linux by APT36 is not merely a technical episode, but a strategic signal: Pakistan’s cyber-espionage machinery is adapting to India’s countermeasures and targeting indigenous solutions once thought secure. Transparent Tribe’s evolution from Windows payloads to Linux-specific malware reveals an expanding toolkit designed to penetrate India’s technological backbone. > The government and military must upgrade the Defence Cyber Agency to a Command-level body and formulate a holistic mechanism for securing national cyberspace. Pakistan’s broader cyber ecosystem, supported by state patronage and interwoven with global hacker networks, poses a persistent threat to India’s national security. For New Delhi, the challenge is not only to neutralise these campaigns but also to reinforce trust in indigenous systems and project resilience. Cyber warfare, unlike conventional conflict, unfolds silently yet relentlessly. In this theatre, the battle is as much about perceptions of security as it is about technical breaches. India’s defensive strategy must therefore be holistic, encompassing technological, institutional, and diplomatic aspects, to ensure that its sovereignty in cyberspace remains uncompromised. **_Soumya Awasthi_** _is a Fellow with the Centre for Security, Strategy and Technology at the Observer Research Foundation._ [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/www.orfonline.org#_ftnref1) BOSS Linux is a free, Indian operating system based on Linux, created by the government to promote open-source software and offer a secure system tailored for India's needs.

India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years.

Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

Due to its geographical location, seismic risk zone and intertropical convergence point, the Indian subcontinent also faces recurring atmospheric phenomena: heavy monsoon rains, floods, episodes of high heat, drought, etc. In addition, the high population density in risk areas further aggravates the situation. The number of human casualties continues to rise, from 1 674 deaths in 2015 to 2 045 in 2019. According to the report of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the total number of people who died between 2 000 and 2 019 is 79 732. During the same period, India had reported 321 catastrophic events. It is the third country in the world in terms of the number of [natural disasters](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/natural-disasters-in-2021), behind China and the United States. According to the same report, India has suffered nearly 80 billion USD in economic losses in 20 years. ## Breakdown of natural disasters in India per type of event and nature of losses | Natural disasters | Material loss | Human loss | | --- | --- | --- | | **Floods** | 52% | 63% | 32% | | **Hurricanes** | 30% | 19% | 32% | | **Landslides** | 10% | - | 2% | | **Earthquakes** | 5% | 10% | 33% | | **Droughts** | 3% | 5% | 1% | | Total | 100% | 100% | 100% | **Source :** World Bank Some of the most frequent disasters include : **Floods** After China, India is the second country hardest hit by floods with no less than 17 of such events annually, affecting 345 million Indians. This scourge has caused a significant number of casualties and major economic damage to infrastructure, property, livelihoods and crops. Heavy monsoon rains in the eastern part of the country often cause the Brahmaputra River to overflow, with disastrous consequences. According to the 2019 Global Climate Risk Index report, floods account for 52% of the total calamities affecting India, claiming 63% of the material damage and 32% of the human losses reported as natural disasters. On an annual average, 7.500.000 hectares are flooded, and 1.600 lives are lost. **Earthquakes** The probability of an earthquake is high in India, with nearly 60% of the territory being classified as a moderate to severe seismic risk zone. According to seismologists, the Himalayas, one of the regions most exposed to earthquakes, should one day suffer a mega-shock caused by the pressure accumulated in the subsoil of the Himalayan arc. The last earthquake to date occurred in 2015. With a magnitude of 7.8, the earthquake killed 9 000 people and injured more than 20 000 others. More than 600 000 homes were also destroyed by the tremor. **Cyclones** Located in the intertropical convergence zone, the Indian subcontinent is one of the regions most affected by cyclones. Its coastline stretching over more than 8 000 kilometers accounts for nearly 10% of the world's tropical cyclones, the majority of which emerge over the Bay of Bengal and strike the east coast of India. On average, six to eight depressions form each year, two or three of which turn into tropical cyclones. A major cyclone (category 3 or more) develops every two years. In May 2020, [Cyclone Amphan](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/cyclone-amphan-15-billion-usd-of-economic-losses-in-south-asia), devastated India and Bangladesh, killing 84 people and devastating the coastal areas of both countries. It was the most powerful cyclone to hit the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 cyclone that killed 10 000 people in Odisha State (northeast India). **Heat waves and droughts** Extreme temperatures and resulting weather conditions significantly affect the health of residents and the agricultural sector. With global warming, these episodes of intense heat, more than 50 degrees, are becoming increasingly frequent. According to Indian authorities, in the last four years the country has reported no less than 4 620 deaths caused by heat waves which generally occur between March and June. The last event of this kind occurred in June 2019, claiming the lives of 50 people in 24 hours. Over the past 20 years, India has also sustained the two most severe droughts in the world. They took place in 2002 and 2015 and affected 300 and 330 million Indians, respectively. Despite the affordability of coverage and the intensity and frequency of natural events, the penetration rate of natural catastrophe insurance in India is almost nil, with less than 1% of the population contracting an insurance policy for this type of risk. For several years, the authorities have been planning to set up a national pool dedicated to natural disasters, a structure struggling to see the light of day. ## List of major natural disasters that have occurred over the last 20 years in India | Date | Place | Nature of the event | Economic losses | Insured losses | Number of fatalities | Number of affected persons | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | (in billion USD) | | **May 2020** | West Bengal | Hurricane Amphan | 13.5 | ND | 103 | 500 000 homeless | | **August 2018** | Kerala | Floods | 3.52 | 0.37 | 504 | 223 139 homeless | | **November 2015** | Chennai (Tamil Nadu) | Floods | 2.37 | 0.98 | 289 | -

These states also face heightened risks: - **Gujarat:** Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. - **Maharashtra:** Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. - **Tamil Nadu:** Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. ## **Earthquake Risks** - Urban centres like **Delhi** and **Ahmedabad** face significant earthquake hazards. - A major earthquake in the **Himalayas** or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** in Gujarat. ## **Challenges in Resilience and Insurance** - Despite the scale of economic losses, **underinsurance** remains a critical issue: - **Protection Gaps:** Over **90%** of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. - **Costliest Flood Events:** - **Mumbai floods (2005):** Losses of **$5.3 billion** (2024 prices) - **Chennai floods (2015):** Losses of **$6.6 billion** (2024 prices) ## **Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach** - Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: - **Hotspot Identification:** - Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. - Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. - **Risk Assessment:** - Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. - Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. - **Reinsurance Solutions:** - Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. - Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. ## **Conclusion** - India's rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. - The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. - By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. * * * ### **Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods?** Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. ### **Q2. When was NDMA constituted?** In December 2005, the Government of India enacted the Disaster Management Act, which envisaged the creation of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers. **Source :** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-economic-losses-natural-catastrophes-9779008/) * * * ​ ​ ​ Submit * * * ![logo](https://www.vajiramandravi.com/_next/static/media/badge_logo.5fb7c7f1.svg) © 2025 Vajiram & Ravi.

It provides background on the Northern Regional Grid, including its generation sources and transmission network. On January 2nd, several transmission lines experienced faults which were not successfully isolated. This led to an imbalance between generation and load. Frequency rose above safe levels, triggering more protective relays and causing a cascading outage across seven states in the region lasting around 16 hours. The document examines the sequence of events based on observations and measurements.

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

Currently, around 50 GW of renewable energy capacity remains stranded across India due to transmission bottlenecks, resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. India needs a comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap that incorporates cluster-level demand forecasting to anticipate emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs. Given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, India must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. Over the past decade, India has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy (RE), ranking third behind China and the US in installations and power generation. More than 71% of India's total installed renewable energy capacity, which stands at approximately [247 gigawatt (GW),](https://mnre.gov.in/en/physical-progress/) comes from solar and wind installations. This surge in clean energy generation, particularly from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources like solar and wind, is prompting a paradigm shift in power transmission dynamics. Power transmission is a critical component of the electricity value chain, and a robust and resilient network is essential for integrating the increasing RE capacity into the grid. Historically, India's power transmission network has been among the most advanced in the world, characterised by proactive planning and upgrades that have resulted in minimal congestion and strong operational performance. However, the significantly shorter gestation periods of VRE installations have left the transmission network struggling to keep pace with RE deployment. The result is a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of energy evacuation infrastructure. The diurnal and seasonal variability of VRE further complicates transmission planning, leading to stranded RE assets and underutilisation of transmission infrastructure. Currently, [around 50 GW of RE capacity is stranded across India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/indias-stranded-renewable-projects-double-to-over-50-gw-industry-documents-show/articleshow/123042172.cms?from=mdr), resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. The rising complications in VRE evacuation and its integration into the power transmission network have prompted power regulators to ramp up their transmission planning efforts. In September 2025, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) Chairperson Ghanshyam Prasad [reaffirmed](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/cea-revises-transmission-plans-every-six-months-for-600-gw-renewables-integration/124114939) the goal of integrating 600 GW of renewables into India’s power grid by 2032. He noted that to ensure seamless integration, the CEA has shifted to potential-based planning, adding that the plans will be revised every six months to reflect continuously evolving ground realities. Monthly meetings are also being held to expedite investment planning and prevent delays in approvals and execution. **Obstacles to an efficient power transmission system** Turning the increased planning efforts into actual implementation will require addressing the persistent challenges that hinder the development of green power transmission, like difficulties in land acquisition for right of way, and overseas transmission equipment procurement constraints, among other issues. Also, state-specific issues—such as Rajasthan's great Indian bustard (GIB) case concerning the critically endangered bird’s deaths from collisions with overhead power lines—further demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of delays that transmission network expansion can face, stretching gestation periods of transmission projects further vis-à-vis solar and wind. Rajasthan, in particular, is grappling with significant transmission bottlenecks, making it a hotspot of stranded RE assets. The primary reasons for this include delayed commissioning of transmission infrastructure, technical and ecological hurdles, and speculative grid access. As of July 2025, around 8 GW out of Rajasthan's 22 GW of operational inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected RE projects remained stranded. Additionally, these projects also faced generation curtailment of roughly 3.8 GW in the same month. These issues underscore the broader problem of rapidly developing geographically concentrated RE capacity without adequate planning and growth of evacuation infrastructure. The [Rajasthan government’s proposal](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/government-to-establish-2k-mwh-battery-storage-plant-for-solar-power/124316705?utm_source=top_news&utm_medium=sectionListing) this year to establish 2,000 megawatt-hour(MWh) of grid-scale battery energy storage aims to mitigate RE power curtailments and improve state grid utilisation. **The need for a strategic roadmap** A comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap is essential to ensure that Rajasthan and other RE-rich states can sustainably integrate future RE capacity additions. This roadmap should be target-oriented and timeline-bound with clearly specified deadlines and associated penalties. It should incorporate cluster-level demand forecasting by coordinating with state IT, industry, and urban development agencies to identify emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle charging (EV) hubs. Moreover, given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, the roadmap must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. The roadmap should also recognise the importance of energy storage systems (ESS). Critical in power generation and distribution, ESSs will also play a vital role in the green power transmission sector. At key transmission nodes, storage systems can provide valuable ancillary services such as frequency regulation, voltage stability, congestion management, and black start capabilities. The roadmap must incorporate and clearly specify the state-wise transmission-focused energy storage requirements. India’s power transmission sector is highly concentrated and averse to foreign and private sector investment. Encouraging participation and fostering an investor-friendly climate will be essential to build the requisite transmission capacity organically. Transmission planning and operations must leverage advanced forecasting, load-flow modelling, and real-time monitoring to enhance predictability and operational efficiency. Additionally, there is a need to move beyond conventional power purchase agreement (PPA) or merit-order based dispatch systems and transition to a security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) model. SCED optimises real-time generation schedules by accounting for constraints such as transmission limits, generator ramp rates, and reserve requirements. Ultimately, a modern and robust transmission network will form the invisible backbone of India’s power sector, one that is flexible, resilient, and fully aligned with the country’s long-term decarbonisation goals.

USAID @ The Asia Foundation LS FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE Improving Lives, Expanding Opportunities INDIA-U.S. TRIANGULAR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 01 The Asia Foundation, 2022, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey - Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. The Asia Foundation: New Delhi Disclaimer This report is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the ‘India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) at The Asia Foundation. The opinions expressed here are solely of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government and The Asia Foundation. 02 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Foreword India and the U.S. share a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region. India’s long\u0002standing engagement in the region makes it a strong development partner and leader. The Asia Foundation through its India- U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a program funded by USAID, is working toward realizing this vision and strengthening India’s and the U.S.’s development cooperation footprint in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The program builds on the U.S. government’s commitment to strengthen triangular partnership programs with India in the Indo-Pacific region and is informed by the U.S. government’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and its Pacific Islands Strategy. TriDeP seeks to support the Government of India’s development assistance in the Indo\u0002Pacific region by identifying countries keen to expand their development partnership with India in sectors defined by their country needs, and by supporting programming based on such identification. Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Smart Agriculture and Renewable Energy are sectors where India demonstrates policy leadership and technical skills, and thus can provide sustainable solutions. This report presents a diagnostic study that maps India’s capabilities in disaster management, as well as identifying opportunities for India and the developing countries in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and South Asia to partner for promising solutions. Over the years, India’s disaster management approach has evolved rapidly to respond to the slew of challenges posed by a range of disasters. India’s diverse geo-climatic conditions make it vulnerable to multiple natural and human\u0002caused disasters, thus prompting the country to develop tailored policies and frameworks for coordinated multi-stakeholder disaster-risk reduction efforts. TriDeP seeks to leverage India’s know-how in disaster management, by sharing technical expertise and knowledge and supporting local adaptation, to improve resilience and preparedness against disasters in the Indo\u0002Pacific region. TriDeP aims to do this in close collaboration with a range of stakeholders, including governments, communities, and the private sector, through cost-effective and context-specific solutions. This diagnostic identifies India’s expertise in establishing well-defined institutional systems; legislative, policy and planning frameworks; robust search and rescue capabilities; improved early warning systems; technological advancements for disaster risk management; improved emergency communication; expanded disaster resource and knowledge networks; emergency operations centers; enhanced response capabilities and systems; and post-disaster mental health management. The study also identifies opportunities for India-U.S. triangular cooperation across several countries in the Indo-Pacific region. While the diagnostic study was underway, the Covid-19 virus struck with severity unimagined in a century and has brought to the fore the disastrous dimensions of pandemics, including psychological and physical health challenges that require concerted medical responses to India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 03 address them. Several participants in a virtual meeting of experts from the Indo-Pacific region to discuss the study expressed interest in the knowledge and expertise of India in psychosocial care and telemedicine health services, both important focus areas that help to address pandemic-related health issues. I would like to thank Balaji Singh Chowhan, who is the lead author and researcher for this report and an expert in disaster managenment. I would like to thank Veena Reddy, USAID/ India and Bhutan Mission Director; Karen Klimowski, Deputy Mission Director; John Smith-Sreen, Director of the Indo-Pacific Office; MaryTyler E. Holmes, Deputy Director of the Indo-Pacific Office; Sukanya Banerjee, Development Partnership Adviser and the Activity Manager for TriDeP; and Arun Sahdeo, Project Management Specialist (Disaster Risk Management) for their support to the program and their valuable inputs and suggestions that enhanced the quality of the report.

Sen Pilgrims being rescued from Badrinath after the 2021 Uttarakhand flood. 10 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey I ndia, due to its unique geo-climatic conditions, is vulnerable to multiple natural and human-caused disasters, such as droughts, floods, earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, hailstorms, cold waves, heat waves, glacier lake outburst floods, wildfires, oil spills, and other major pollution events. The country’s journey toward holistic and modern disaster risk reduction (DRR) practices began more than 20 years ago, when several natural disasters resulted in thousands of deaths and enormous economic losses. These disasters spurred India toward a more comprehensive DRR approach, eventually leading the country to tremendous disaster management progress: Subsequent disasters have resulted in minimized deaths and losses because of India’s effective DRR efforts. Over the course of the past two decades, India’s disaster management approach evolved from a reactive, search-and-rescue, and relief-centered approach primarily centered on flood and drought to a proactive, holistic approach that includes prevention, mitigation, preparedness, capacity building, risk reduction, technological investment and advancements, community involvement, and risk resilience for a far wider range of hazards. Holistic disaster management requires mainstreaming DRR into policies, institutions, infrastructure, and logistics in order to develop tools for effective and efficient action. India developed DRR policies for multiple stakeholders by integrating inputs from domain experts and all levels of governments and communities; it also increased response effectiveness through international coalitions, and coordinated risk reduction capabilities at the national and local levels. India’s holistic DRR efforts involve robust legal frameworks; effective policy design and development; domestic policy and institutional coherence; a focus on capacity building, expert input, and knowledge sharing; well-oiled administrative mechanisms; an ability to prevent or mitigate disasters before they occur, as well as effective and inclusive rescue and recovery operations. India’s disaster management learning curve owes a great deal to how India adapted crucial disaster management elements from other countries to India’s own context. Now, other countries have the opportunity to emulate India’s DRR journey in order to accelerate their own efforts, thereby saving thousands of lives and millions in economic losses. India has multiple bilateral and multilateral DRR relationships with other countries, such as the United States, Switzerland, Australia, Russia, the European Commission, and United Nations agencies. Given this international cooperation framework already in place and India’s extensive DRR capabilities, it would be hugely beneficial for India to branch out to additional triangular cooperation (TrC) initiatives, especially partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which already has a strong DRR backbone with India. These TrC initiatives would be led by India as the primary source of expertise and technical assistance and could also benefit from the involvement of several United States agencies and private-sector or nongovernmental organizations. India’s South-South development cooperation model would thus be considerably enhanced, with the triangulation of efforts between India and the United States increasing India’s development assistance footprint in the developing countries of the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. This report begins with an explanation of India’s 20-year journey from search and rescue\u0002related crisis management to prevention, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 11 mitigation, and preparedness, setting the groundwork for how India’s experiences can be adapted to other countries’ own disaster management contexts. The second chapter details the interplay between India’s DRR strategy, legislation, policy interventions, disaster management administration and institutions, and its perspectives on gender equity and social inclusion in DRR efforts. Chapter three breaks down how India can share its knowledge and DRR capabilities through the country’s multiple DRR technologies and capacity-building institutions, including centers of excellence for training in general disaster management and early warning systems; specialized institutions for search and rescue and disaster assessment, mitigation, and planning; private- and nongovernmental organization\u0002run training institutes; Incident Command System adaptations; risk communication and language adaptations; and equipment stocks and suppliers. The fourth chapter outlines the DRR status of three Indo-Pacific sub-regions: South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indo-Pacific Islands, and briefly discusses the potential DRR needs of ideal TrC partners. Chapter five concludes with a discussion about the viability of TrC initiatives, and makes recommendations for suitable TrC activities in 10 Indo-Pacific countries. About the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) India, The Asia Foundation is implementing the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a three-year program in support of the United States’ and India’s mutual aims in the Indo\u0002Pacific Region. In a ground-breaking initiative to catalyze North-South-South triangular cooperation (TrC) throughout an entire region – the Indo-Pacific – rather than with a single country, the TriDeP program will facilitate partnerships between India, the United States, and several South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Indo-Pacific Island countries.1 The TriDeP program has identified three priority areas where India can share its proven expertise: disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate-smart agriculture, and renewable energy. The TriDeP program team selected DRR for its inaugural research initiative to explore how and where India’s demonstrated DRR policy leadership, practical experience, and sustainable results can be shared with countries in the region. After assessing India’s DRR capacities and capabilities and matching them to the needs and capabilities of potential Indo-Pacific partner countries, the TriDeP program will develop demand-driven, context-specific TrC projects that combine Indian experience and Photographer: Saikiran Kesari Stranded citizens making their way through the flooded streets of Mumbai, India during the 2020 Mumbai floods. 12 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey expertise with Indian and American technical assistance, drawing on India’s centers of excellence, training institutions, relevant private sector entities, and nongovernmental and civil society organizations. Research Objectives The TriDeP program team undertook action research on India’s DRR institutions and capabilities in order to understand the Indian\u0002Indo-Pacific DRR landscape, identify DRR needs in potential beneficiary countries, highlight areas of India’s DRR expertise that could be shared, suggest priority partners and projects for initial TrC implementations, and determine suitable activities to support project design and implementation. Research Methodology The action research for this report took place from January through June 2021. The research process began with a thorough review of the literature followed by nine telephone and seven in-person interviews with 16 Indian government representatives, technical specialists, and practitioners experienced in DRR and disaster management in order to gain a preliminary overview of India’s current capabilities – what we will call the “supply-side” of DRR (see Annexure 1 for participant list). The study also involved extensive desk research to gather background information about India’s supply-side capabilities. The supply-side research also involved convening a group of 17 experts from India, including independent DRR experts, leaders of DRR civil society organizations (CSOs) working in India, and current and retired government functionaries who lead or have led India’s disaster responses. These experts were joined by six supporting Photographer: Dr. Ashok K A Doppler Radar meteorological geodesic dome atop a hillock at Vishakhapatnam, India. India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 13 staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 2 for participant list). The supply-side research was complemented by what we will call “demand-side” desk research about Indo-Pacific countries’ geographies and their disaster exposures, histories, institutional and technical capabilities, current disaster\u0002aid partnerships, and relevant socioeconomic profiles. The desk research was enhanced through discussions with a group of 39 experts in the fields of DRR and climate change impacts; these experts represented countries, states, or organizations from Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Germany, India, Nepal, United Kingdom, United Nations, United States, and international nongovernmental and civil society organizations. These experts were joined by seven supporting staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 3 for participant list). The demand-side experts discussed DRR needs as perceived by countries in the region, identified geopolitical interests or sensitivities, and postulated supply-demand matches. Since Covid-19 pandemic restrictions prevented in-person meetings, both supply- and demand-side convenings took place online and lasted about two hours each. During the demand-side convening, the Covid-19 pandemic prompted requests from some Indo-Pacific countries for assistance with health- and psychosocial-care needs to combat and counter the effects of the pandemic. Although the TriDeP team did not focus on pandemic disasters in the initial research phases, this report describes some of India’s supply-side telemedicine and psychosocial-care capabilities that could match demand-side requests for pandemic- and other health-related cooperation projects. Drawing on the desk research, interviews, and discussions with the TriDeP program team, and his own extensive experience in the field and personal familiarity with the actors, the author identifies 10 countries as potential TrC candidates and indicates their potential needs for equipment, services, and technical assistance that would increase the effectiveness of disaster risk management and response. In his selection of potential match countries, the author also considered complementary and competing DRR programs and activities already in progress with other providers. The author cautions, of course, that all DRR assistance proposals should align with host government priorities and that all recommended disaster management solutions must be fine-tuned and based on further contextual analyses. Pertinent facts about the 10 potential match countries and possible TrC initiatives are detailed in Annexure 4, which covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Fiji, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Maldives, the Philippines, Nepal, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. In addition, the author presents disaster risk profiles for 16 other Indo-Pacific Region countries that may become candidates for TrC in the future: Brunei, Cook Islands, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, and Vanuatu (Annexure 5). The author’s TrC recommendations are consistent with the Intermediate Result (IR) 3.1 of the USAID India Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS).2 The Asia Foundation is a non-profit international development organization committed to improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia. Informed by six decades of experience and deep local expertise, its work across the region addresses five overarching goals – strengthen governance, empower women, expand economic opportunity, increase environmental resilience, and promote international cooperation. The TriDeP creates an opportunity for The Asia Foundation to examine emerging cross-cutting critical issues, such as disaster risk reduction, that warrant deeper investigation to inform its program strategies to ensure the Foundation remains at the leading edge of changing dynamics in the regional context – geopolitical, environmental, and legal/regulatory – and well-positioned to tackle the most critical issues facing Asia.

To be effective, all these elements must come together as a seamless whole. The policies, institutions, and logistics of disaster management are as important as the actual equipment used to rescue people – absolutely vital in handling disasters, in reaching to the last mile, and in determining the tools for effective and efficient action. Equally important is the involvement of disaster management practitioners in policy design and development – the domain and subject matter experts who understand the complexity and who know how to make disaster management policies, institutions, and logistics work together most effectively. Effective disaster management usually requires a long phase of development; time is the main challenge in setting up vital elements. Experts see India’s present disaster management approach as a journey that lasted just over two decades. It began at the time of super Cyclone Photographer: Fernando Quevedo de Oliveira Forest fires above Thak village in Uttarakhand, India in May, 2016. 16 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey ‘The Government of India and other stakeholders implemented recommenda- tions from a High Powered Committee (HPC). ‘The HPC’s report guided India’s disaster managernent approach from a relief-centric approach to one that embrac- es prevention, mitigation, and preparedness. fo strengthen India’s approach, the HPC. also made other recommendations: linking development efforts to disaster reduction; estab- lishing a disaster knowledge network, promoting interna- tional cooperation; applying a national disaster mitigation strat adopting a commu- nity-based approach; and fostering a culture of preven- tive thinking, The enactment of the National Disast ment Act and the de lop- ment of a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and state- and district-level disaster n ‘ nt authorities (SDMAs and DDMAs) set the stage for India’s National Institute m of Disaster Management (NIDM) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 17 The National Policy on Disaster Management (2009) motivated community-based disaster management, last-mile integration of policy and plans, executional capacity development, consolidation of past initia- tives, deployment of best prs agencies at national and tices, cooperation with international levels, and multi-sectoral synergies. First announced in Novem- ber 2016 during the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, the Prime Minister's Ten Point Agenda restated DRR priorities, such as bolstering local capacities, enhancing, knowledge networks, and supporting international coalitions. The 2016 National Disaster Management Plan, subse- quently updated in 2019, provided a [ramework for disaster management plans at the ministerial, depart mental, state, and district levels. The Plan set out mechanisms for multiagency coordina- tion: the National Executive Committee (NEC), headed by the Ministry of Home Affairs Secretary at the national level, and the State Executive headed by a Chief Secretary mmiittee, at the state-government level.",

The country’s growing digital economy, increasing foreign direct investment in ICT and manufacturing, and government incentives for R&D in strategic sectors make it an attractive target for state-sponsored actors seeking to steal valuable intellectual property and economic information. Since 2018, Thailand has actively pursued a 20-year development strategy to extend its knowledge economy. The strategy, which has been adopted into legislation, [focuses](http://nscr.nesdb.go.th/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/National-Strategy-Eng-Final-25-OCT-2019.pdf.) on developing various types of capital, including human, intellectual, financial, mechanised, social and natural resources. As part of the strategy, Thailand has also [unleashed](https://www.industry.go.th/web-upload/1xff0d34e409a13ef56eea54c52a291126/m_magazine/12668/373/file_download/b29e16008a87c72b354efebef853a428.pdf) a vision of ‘Thailand 4.0’ to transform Thailand into a value-based economy built on science, technology and innovation. Overall, Thailand’s knowledge sector is seeing modest signs of development. Thailand’s patent applications have hovered around 1,400 to 1,900 per year. Patent approval rates have remained low as Thailand faces issues with extensive backlogs and long delays in IP registration. In 2018, WIPO reported that Thailand’s success rate in granting patents was only 14%. Thailand’s foreign and economic policy is driven by pragmatism, as the government seeks to secure economic gains for national development. Thailand also maintains healthy economic and scientific ties with Japan and the US. Both were the biggest investors among OECD countries from 2020 to 2022. Thailand also maintains strong economic ties with China. A part of the relationship focuses on technology investments and technology transfers from China to Thailand. The economic relationship has included strong collaboration in science and technology, and Chinese firms have invested in Thailand’s 5G infrastructure and the broader connectivity ecosystem, including railways. While the two states maintain a bilateral IP agreement, the focus of the agreement is on capacity building. For instance, China has helped to cultivate engineering talent for high-speed railways in Thailand. Overall, Thailand’s relationship with China is quite comprehensive, touching on economics, technology transfers and scientific cooperation. How prepared is Thailand Thailand maintains modest defences to combat the threat of cyber-enabled IP theft. Broadly, cybersecurity in Thailand has struggled to keep pace with economic development and the digital transformation. While there’s better awareness in cyber-dependent sectors, the overall population lacks digital literacy and cybersecurity knowledge, leading to a very high number of cybercrime victims. The banking sector, in particular, has established cybersecurity measures, and government and businesses have invested more in awareness building. The National Cyber Security Agency (established in 2011), Office of the Personal Data Protection Committee, and the Royal Thai Police play significant roles in regulating and enforcing cybersecurity and combating cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes. The country participates in international agreements and norms related to cybersecurity, seeking bilateral cooperation while balancing relationships with major powers and multilateral cooperation. Thailand hasn’t ratified the Budapest Convention, but it complies with its principles through the Computer Crime Act. Thailand is currently playing an active role in the UN’s Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of ICTs for Criminal Purposes. Overall, Thailand’s posture on international norms on state behaviour in cyberspace has been reactive, though it does comply with most international standards. Thailand has been working to improve IP protection and enforcement to address IP theft. IP governance has almost all the necessary policy frameworks and organisational structures in place. A subcommittee on IP rights enforcement was set up in 2016 to bring 16 government agencies as well as industry groups together to promote IP protection and counter IP violations. In 2017, the Department of Intellectual Property formed a multiagency centre, called Intellectual Property Enforcement, which includes 39 agencies, such as the Internal Security Operations Command, the Royal Thai Police and other public and private agencies to crack down on markets that violate IP laws. Amendments to the Computer Crime Act 2007 in 2017 and additional measures in the Copyright Act now enable internet service providers and commercial service platforms to take down infringing content. There’s a growing culture of IP protection in Thailand, and the country moved up in the US’s Special 301 Report from the Priority Watch List to the Watch List tier in 2017. Efficiency in implementation and enforcement is the biggest stumbling block, in large part due to bureaucratic mechanisms. Altogether, the country’s participation in international IP agreements reflects its commitment to IP protection, but it’s considered a follower rather than a leading actor in the international IP protection agenda. # **Reported cases of economic cyber-espionage** ### Name of Incident ### Victims (entities) ### Sectors Affected ### Affected economies ### Threat Actor ### Alleged state sponsor ### Date reported Operation Cloud Hopper (APT10) Customers or providers of Managed Services / Enterprise Service / Cloud Services, manufacturing companies in India, Japan and Northern Europe; a mining company in South America; and multiple IT service providers worldwide. Computer System Design and Related Services, Telecommunications, Mining Australia, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, India, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand, UK APT10 China 2017 ### Context Operation Cloud Hopper is one of the largest sustained global cyber espionage campaigns. The operation has been traced back to at least 2016 and has targeted managed IT service providers, thus acquiring potentially unprecedented access to IP and sensitive data of those MSPs as well as their clients across the globe. Some of these targets compromised include Fujitsu, Tata Consultancy Services, NTT Data, Dimension Data, Computer Sciences Corporation, DXC Technology, Ericsson, and IBM (see Operation Cloud Hopper). A wide range of sectors were affected, ranging from telecommunications to mining. The suspected targets of these operations were those that aligned with China’s national security and “Made in China” goals, focused primarily on valuable military and intelligence information as well as confidential business data. PwC, in cooperation with BAE Systems and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, attributed the attacks to APT10, a China-based hacking group. Symantec, similarly, found an advanced persistent threat campaign targeting companies in multiple sectors across 17 regions in Japan. This campaign was also attributed to Cloud Hopper (which they called Cicada).Several countries, including the US and Australia, attributed Operation Cloud Hopper to a hacking group that has backing from the Chinese state. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Intellectual property, possibly worth billons of dollars ### Attribution [PwC](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/operation-cloud-hopper.html), [Symantec](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage), Governments of US, UK, New Zealand, and Australia ### Governments' response The U.S. Government held the Chinese government accountable for these campaigns, including [indicting](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion) suspected hackers.

Emissary Panda may also be connected to several other PRC-sponsored APTs, including Emmisary Panda, APT27, and Luckymouse 2018 ### Context Dubbed “Operation Pzchao” by Romanian cybersecurity firm Bitdefender, this cyber campaign targeted government institutions, as well as private firms in the technology, education, and telecommunications sector that are primarily based in the U.S., though with also some cases in several other countries. Bitdefender attributed the attack to Emmisary Panda, a China-based threat group active since 2010. The group has been suspected of conducting [espionage](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/ransomware-protection/mustang-panda) operations on civil society organisations and governments deemed critical of the PRC, including advocacy organisations on Taiwan and Tibetan independence. While this threat group’s focus has traditionally been on political espionage, we suspect – with moderate confidence¬ – that this attack had possible economic objectives as well. Initiated in July 2017, this cyber incident came against the backdrop of developments in China’s technology and telecommunications sector, including Beijing [laying out](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/business/china-artificial-intelligence.html) a development plan to become the world leader in AI by 2030. The Iron Tiger APT (aka Panda Emissary or TG-3390) is active at least since 2010 and targeted organization in APAC, but since 2013 it is attacking high-technology targets in the US. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Unknown ### Attribution [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/185/Bitdefender-Business-2017-WhitePaper-PZCHAO-crea2452-en-EN-GenericUse.pdf) ### Governments' response None ### Sources ### Level of confidence **Moderate Confidence** **(7 out of 12)** - Private entities are a majority of known sectors targeted in the intrusion (2 points) - No clear information if commercial data is targeted (1 point) - APT actor has some history of stealing IP and other commercially valuable data (2 points) - No concrete evidence that data stolen was used to aid domestic private businesses of malign state, but data stolen likely aligns with malign state’s industrial policies (2 points) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Germany, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, USA and Vietnam Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) 2017 ### Context In 2017, FireEye announced that they have observed APT32 conducting cyberespionage operations targeting foreign companies with a vested interest in Vietnam’s manufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors.

These campaigns were conducted in three clusters. First, from January to March 2020, there was a broad campaign against 75 private entities in 20 countries, with a focus on industries ranging from petrochemicals to defense industrial base. Mandiant notes that while it’s unclear if APT41 scanned the Internet and attempted exploitation en masse or selected a subset of specific organizations to target, the victims appear to be more targeted in nature. The economies affected were Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, UAE, UK and USA. Second, in September 2020, hackers associated with APT41 were [charged](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) by the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with computer intrusion campaigns against more than 100 victims globally, including in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The entities affected were those that specialize in software development, manufacturers, telecommunications, non-profit, universities, and civil society organizations. Third, from July 2020 until August 2021 (ongoing as of then), Trend Micro observed an espionage campaign against victims in India, m, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam in the airline, computer hardware, automotive, infrastructure, publishing, media, and IT industries. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Sensitive business information, source codes, software codes signing certificates, and customer account data ### Attribution US Government, [Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits); [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/apt41-resurfaces-as-earth-baku-with-new-cyberespionage-campaign.html) ### Governments' response In second incident, U.S. Department of Justice [indicts](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) seven individuals (two arrested, five remaining) ### Sources ### Level of confidence **High Confidence (9 out of 12)** - Private entities are a majority of known sectors targeted in the intrusion (2 points) - Commercial data are likely to have been targeted (2 points) - APT actor is strongly associated with economic espionage operations, with motivations strongly tied to certain states’ industrial policy objectives (3 points) - No concrete evidence that data stolen was used to aid domestic private businesses of malign state, but data stolen likely aligns with malign state’s industrial policies (2 points) ### Office 40 Macquarie StreetBarton ACT 2600 ### Contact Ph: +61 2 6270 5100 [E: enquiries@aspi.org.au](mailto:hello@aspi.com) ### Explore [Home](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au) [About](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/about) [Country Profiles](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/country-profiles) [Insights](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/insight) [Media](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/media) [Case Repository](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/case-repository) © 2025 ASPI.

China and India have accused each other of firing shots during a Sept. 7 incident south of Pangong Lake, marking the first official claims of small arms fire on the border since 1975. While the situation in Ladakh had calmed down after the deadly June 15 melee in Galwan Valley, a resurgence of tensions is now occurring in a separate area of the disputed territory. Since Aug. 29, Chinese forces have allegedly been trying to cross into Indian controlled territory in the mountainous area between Pangong and Spanggur Lakes.

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism.

In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

India can generate renewable power, but without urgent upgrades to storage and transmission infrastructure, its clean energy ambitions risk stalling at a critical moment [Himanshu Ojha](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/author/himanshu-ojha) Updated on: 28 October 2025 6:16 pm Updated on: 28 October 2025 6:16 pm [SUBSCRIBE](https://subscriptions.outlookbusiness.com/default?_gl=1*xh9irm*_gcl_au*NDczNjgzMjM0LjE3NTEyOTMzMDQ.*_ga*MTcwMTQwMzY0MS4xNzQzNjkwODUw*_ga_EQ1QWF0GDN*czE3NTI2NzA2ODQkbzE1JGcwJHQxNzUyNjcwNjg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMjA0NDU4MDI1Mg..&userId=62f0aa5bcec7e365f6491e6d&referrarData=eyJ1c2VyU291cmNlRGF0YSI6Ik9USEVSUyIsInJlZmVycmVyIjoib3V0bG9va2J1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyZXJVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXRsb29rYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tLyJ9) Electricity Grid Electricity Grid Summary of this article - **Generation Outpaces Grid:** Over 50 GW of renewable capacity remains stranded due to inadequate transmission and delayed PPAs, despite India’s strong progress in clean energy generation. - **Transmission Bottlenecks:** Annual transmission expansion lags 40% behind targets, hindered by slow clearances, fragmented planning, and the geographical mismatch between generation and demand centres. - **Storage Shortfall:** India has just 205 MW of battery storage against a projected need of 411 GWh by 2032, making it impossible to shift surplus solar power to evening hours. - **Urgent Reforms Needed:** Achieving the 500 GW goal will require faster project clearances, coordinated Centre-state planning, and massive investments in both grid and storage infrastructure. India made impressive strides in renewable energy in recent years, with record capacity additions in recent years. However, the country’s power- transmission network has struggled to keep pace, leading to a clear gap between the generation and the evacuation infrastructure. The result? Over 50 GW of renewable energy capacity, enough to provide clean energy to 80-85 million households, cannot start operations and an extra 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide is being released daily into the atmosphere, all due to the lack of power cables and delays in the signing of power purchase agreements. [Follow our WhatsApp channel](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaFex3u0gcfHwT13lj1d) **The Ambition** Lapses on the transmission side can not only impact the environment and economic development, but also derail the country’s energy transition strategy. During the COP26 summit in 2021, India committed to installing 500 GW of non-fossil fuel based power capacity by 2030, with solar energy contributing the largest share at 280 GW, followed by 140 GW from wind power, with hydropower, bioenergy, and nuclear energy chipping in with the rest. So far, India’s progress has been significant. According to the latest data from Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), India’s non-fossil fuel capacity currently stands at 256 GW and is expected to reach around 300 GW soon, with over 40 GW of renewable energy projects in advanced stages such as signing power purchase agreements (PPAs) and securing transmission connectivity. Among the key drivers for this clean revolution have been advances in technology and scale that have helped drive down costs. “The cost of installing panels whether on rooftops or utility-scale plants has fallen dramatically over the years,” points out Gaurav Upadhyay, Energy Finance Specialist at Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). However, going forward, even the government acknowledges that maintaining this pace of growth will require an amended playbook. “In the last decade, India’s renewable energy capacity has grown more than fivefold, from under 35 GW in 2014 to over 197 GW (excluding large hydro) today. The next leap requires not just more megawatts, but deeper system reforms,” the MNRE Ministry said in a press statement this month. The challenges related to the transmission network stem from essentially three sources — delayed execution, fragmented planning and the fluctuating nature of renewable power generation. First, let us look at the last element — the fluctuating nature of power generation from renewable sources. [Govt Ramps Up Transmission Infra Construction to Meet India’s Growing Green Energy Demand](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/industry/govt-ramps-up-transmission-infra-construction-to-meet-indias-growing-green-energy-demand) BY [Outlook Business Desk](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/author/outlook-business-desk) **Grid Under Pressure** Designers of power transmission grids have always taken into account the need for a certain level of over capacity. This is because the demand for power varies significantly by the time of the day, and even season. For example, a grid catering primarily to a residential population may see peak demand in the evenings and summers, while an industrial area may see peak demand during day time. While historically, this cycle has primarily been demand led, the rise of renewables has led to the emergence of supply led fluctuations as renewables do not produce electricity at a uniform, or even predictable, pattern. Hence, on the days of high solar output, producers are often forced to curtail generation, leading to wasted energy and losses for developers. On the other hand, output can drop significantly on cloudy or rainy days, leading to underutilization of the grid and undersupply. Similar fluctuations are also seen on the grids connected to wind farms, with the variations connected to atmospheric conditions rather than insolation. According to Mercom Clean Energy Insights, since March 2025, nearly 4 GW of Wind-solar energy has been curtailed only in Rajasthan due to delays in transmission projects and lower power demand due to above-normal rainfall this year. It is therefore not surprising that India’s electricity grid infrastructure, designed decades ago for the steady supply generated by coal-based thermal power plants, is struggling to accommodate the variable and intermittent nature of renewable energy. A significant portion of renewable power often goes unused due to transmission bottlenecks and fluctuating demand, pointed out Upadhyay. “This oversupply has even driven daytime spot market prices into negative. India needs to ramp up its energy storage so excess solar power generated during the day can be stored and used later,” he added. Nikhil Nahar, Co-founder of SolarSquare, pointed out that operating a grid in today’s times has become far more complicated than it was in an era of predictable generation and demand, leading to the need for more sophisticated designs and advanced grid management tools. “This intermittency demands real-time balancing, flexible generation sources, and advanced forecasting tools—areas where India’s grid still lacks depth,” he noted. Compounding the challenge is the geographical mismatch between generation and demand. Much of India’s renewable energy is being generated in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, far from industrial demand centres such as Maharashtra, Delhi, and Karnataka. The mismatch between where power is produced and where it is consumed, which leads to evacuation difficulties, has become one of the most serious structural challenges in India’s energy transition. “Several auctioned renewable projects remain stranded as PPAs stall and transmission lags especially in Rajasthan and Gujarat, where 8-11 GW is stuck,” Upadhyay noted. **The Infrastructure Gap: Transmission and Storage** The second factor behind the grid’s inability to support the growth of renewable power is a lack of investment, giving rise to a widening infrastructure gap between the pace of renewable capacity additions and the development of supporting transmission and storage systems. Despite increased private sector participation under Tariff-Based Competitive Bidding, India’s overall transmission expansion has been slow and remains below National Electricity Policy targets. Annual transmission line additions have fallen short of planned levels since FY2019, with only FY2021 surpassing expectations. According to the recent _Transmission expansion trails renewable energy growth in India_ report by IEEFA and JMK Research: “In FY2025, 8,830 circuit kilometres (ckm) of new transmission lines were commissioned against a target of 15,253 ckm, representing a 42% gap, with Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) additions at their lowest in a decade.” “The challenge begins right from the planning stage of a transmission project,” said Vishal Tripathi, Former Public Policy Expert at NITI Aayog. “These assets often have to pass through forest areas, defence land, agricultural zones and commercial properties, each requiring multiple clearances and permissions from different authorities.” However, transmission is only part of the puzzle. The intermittency of renewables means that to complete the transition, the grid must be connected with energy storage facilities. However, this is also an area which is at its infancy in India. The country’s current installed capacity of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is at just 205 MW whereas, according to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) estimates, the country will need 411.4 Gigawatt-hour (GWh) of energy storage systems by 2031-32. Of this, around – 236.2GWh, is expected to come from battery energy storage systems (BESS) and the remaining 175.2 GWh from pumped-hydro storage plants. Upadhyay of IEEFA points out that we cannot move away from our reliance on thermal plants until we get this part of the puzzle right. “We don’t yet have enough storage to shift daytime solar power to evening hours.” [About 48 GW Inter-State Transmission System Network Completed for RE Evacuation: Govt](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/economy-and-policy/about-48-gw-inter-state-transmission-system-network-completed-for-re-evacuation-govt) BY [PTI](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/author/pti) **Policy and Institutional Bottlenecks** The third element hampering the growth of transmission capacity in India is gaps in planning. The CEA, the central government agency in charge of transmission, has prepared a detailed National Electricity Plan (Transmission) to build up 500 GW of renewable energy transmission capacity by the year 2030 and 600 GW by 2032. According to the plan, over 1.91 lakh ckm of transmission lines and 1,270 GVA of transformation capacity is planned to be added during the ten year period from 2022-23 to 2031-32 (at 220 kV and above voltage level). In addition, the inter-regional transmission capacity is planned to increase to 143 GW by the year 2027 and further to 168 GW by the year 2032, from the present level of 119 GW. However, what the plan fails to address is the key question of who will invest in these inter-state transmission networks. If the responsibility falls largely on DISCOMs, that would create major problems, because most of them are already under severe financial stress. By 2023–24, their cumulative losses had reached nearly ₹6.9 lakh crore, while their outstanding debt stood at around ₹6.8 trillion. “Power distribution companies need sufficient funds to ensure smooth operations and capital investment. Without sufficient financial resources, the reliability of power system is compromised,” said Karn Pallav, Head –Regulatory Affairs, BSES Rajdhani Power. [India Cancels Grid Access for 17 GW Renewable Projects as Demand Soars — Here’s Why](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/industry/india-cancels-grid-access-17gw-renewable-projects) BY [Outlook Planet Desk](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/author/outlook-planet-desk) Today, the situation is such that even if India installs 500 GW of renewable capacity, it won’t be able to transmit all the power where it is needed. Bridging this gap will demand unprecedented coordination between the Centre and the states, faster clearances for transmission projects, and a massive push to develop storage infrastructure. Some of the initiatives that can help in addressing the gap include a single-window clearance system to streamline approvals for land acquisition, right-of-way and grid connectivity, performance-linked incentives and disincentives based on asset utilisation and asset monetisation and public-private partnerships. In addition, the country has to set up massive energy storage systems in renewable-rich regions such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu and co-locate solar and wind plants with such systems. India's clean energy transition now hinges less on generation and more on storage and transmission. Without swift action, we risk derailing the green transition of the world's fastest-growing economy. ##### Related Content [L&T's Power Transmission & Distribution Vertical Bags Grid Infrastructure Orders in Middle East](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/corporate/lts-power-transmission-distribution-vertical-bags-grid-infrastructure-orders-in-middle-east) [Sembcorp to Acquire 100% Stake in ReNew Sun Bright for about ₹1,700 Cr](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/corporate/sembcorp-to-acquire-100-stake-in-renew-sun-bright-for-about-1700-cr) [Why Coal Continues to Rule the Grid](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/why-coal-continues-to-rule-the-grid) [India Cancels Grid Access for 17 GW Renewable Projects as Demand Soars — Here’s Why](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/industry/india-cancels-grid-access-17gw-renewable-projects) ##### Related Content [L&T's Power Transmission & Distribution Vertical Bags Grid Infrastructure Orders in Middle East](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/corporate/lts-power-transmission-distribution-vertical-bags-grid-infrastructure-orders-in-middle-east) [Sembcorp to Acquire 100% Stake in ReNew Sun Bright for about ₹1,700 Cr](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/corporate/sembcorp-to-acquire-100-stake-in-renew-sun-bright-for-about-1700-cr) [Why Coal Continues to Rule the Grid](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/why-coal-continues-to-rule-the-grid) [India Cancels Grid Access for 17 GW Renewable Projects as Demand Soars — Here’s Why](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/industry/india-cancels-grid-access-17gw-renewable-projects) Published At: 28 October 2025 6:16 pm [SUBSCRIBE](https://subscriptions.outlookbusiness.com/default?_gl=1*xh9irm*_gcl_au*NDczNjgzMjM0LjE3NTEyOTMzMDQ.*_ga*MTcwMTQwMzY0MS4xNzQzNjkwODUw*_ga_EQ1QWF0GDN*czE3NTI2NzA2ODQkbzE1JGcwJHQxNzUyNjcwNjg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMjA0NDU4MDI1Mg..&userId=62f0aa5bcec7e365f6491e6d&referrarData=eyJ1c2VyU291cmNlRGF0YSI6Ik9USEVSUyIsInJlZmVycmVyIjoib3V0bG9va2J1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyZXJVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXRsb29rYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tLyJ9) Tags -

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962.

[Manish Singh](https://substack.com/@refsrc) Oct 07, 2025 24 [1](https://indiadispatch.com/p/india-grid-cannot-keep-up-with-its-ambitions/comments) 3 [Share](javascript:void(0)) India’s economic expansion and accelerating digitalisation are creating a surge in electricity demand that is exposing deep vulnerabilities in the existing power grid. The South Asian nation has committed to 500 gigawatts of non-fossil capacity by 2030, but the grid cannot yet reliably deliver clean power when and where it is needed. Supply will have to grow faster, be firmer and be more flexible than the system has ever delivered. If India captures a larger share of global data center investment driven by AI, this challenge will arrive precisely when the grid is least equipped to handle it. Goldman Sachs estimates that power required from utilities now needs roughly 7.2% annual growth between fiscal years 2025 and 2035, up from a prior 5.6%. The ratio of power growth to economic growth has been revised to roughly 1.06, versus roughly 0.85 before. Rising appliance ownership, electric vehicle charging and green-hydrogen pilots are pushing demand higher across the economy. The compute infrastructure supporting the digital economy is migrating from traditional IT rooms to industrial-scale data centres, creating a new and concentrated source of load that operates on a different scale than anything the grid has handled before. Hyperscalers say power is the first or second question in every investment decision when they evaluate potential data center locations. India’s data-centre base is still in the low single-gigawatts today, but Bernstein forecasts cluster around 5 to 6 gigawatts by 2030, provided interconnects and land clear on time. Jefferies’ top-end view reaches roughly 8 gigawatts, which at typical costs of 4 to 5 million dollars per megawatt implies 32 to 40 billion dollars of capital expenditure by decade-end. AI servers draw five to seven times the power of a legacy server rack, according to HSBC, creating disproportionate pressure on the grid. At scale, a 1 gigawatt campus needs roughly 1.3 to 1.5 gigawatts of constant supply depending on how efficiently the facility uses power, per Morgan Stanley. Power availability and connection queues now drive site selection as much as land price does, fundamentally altering the economics of where these facilities can be built. Data centres use only a sliver of India’s power today, but their share plausibly rises into the low single digits by fiscal year 2030 even in Nomura’s base case scenario. In a more aggressive scenario, consumption reaches 80 terawatt-hours, creating demand that would rival entire industrial sectors. Silicon wants electrons on a firm schedule that the current grid cannot reliably provide. India can construct utility-scale solar farms in 12 to 24 months (Mohit Bhargava, Senior Advisor to India Energy and Climate Center at UC Berkeley and former CEO of NTPC Green Energy said at a recent conference), which makes the renewable buildout look deceptively simple on paper. Reconciling that speed with the physics of electricity demand is proving harder in practice. Solar panels flood the grid when daytime demand is comparatively low, then fade precisely as households and commercial loads climb after 5 PM. On Goldman’s full-year models, the system runs a 1% to 4% energy deficit by fiscal years 2034 through 2035. Five-minute modelling of the peak week under adverse weather produces a deficit nearer 9%. This is not a morality tale about dirty versus clean energy sources but a timing problem that no amount of solar capacity alone can solve, no matter how many panels are installed or how quickly they are brought online. Coal plants can run around the clock and can ramp up production during the evening hours to meet surging demand. Legacy flexibility in the existing fleet complicates this seemingly straightforward solution in ways that limit how much solar the grid can absorb. Many Indian units struggle to operate at levels much below 60% to 70% of capacity, according to data shared by federal grid operator POSOCO. Operating at these minimum levels is crucial to keep the grid’s frequency stable, yet this makes it harder to absorb midday solar or respond to clouds passing overhead. Flexibility retrofits and revised operating norms matter as much as new megawatts in addressing this constraint, but the scale of the upgrades required is substantial. Assessments suggest India may need roughly 140 gigawatts of additional coal capacity by fiscal year 2035 versus 2023 levels. The government’s current target is roughly 87 gigawatts by fiscal year 2032. Some of this coal is bridge capacity to stabilise a faster-greening grid, not a repudiation of renewables, but the scale required exceeds what policymakers have publicly acknowledged or what most analysts expected even two years ago. Transmission infrastructure is the rate-limiter on the entire system, constraining how quickly renewable capacity can be added even when the generation itself can be built rapidly. The National Electricity Plan allocates about $110 billion for transmission through 2032, expanding the network from roughly 485,000 to roughly 648,000 circuit-kilometres and adding nine long-haul high-voltage direct current links totalling roughly 33 gigawatts. Typical interstate lines take 30 to 36 months to complete, and that timeline arrives before accounting for right-of-way fights and land acquisition disputes that routinely add years to the process. India’s present ability to move power through the system at high voltages is nowhere near what a continent-scale renewables-plus-data-centre system needs to function efficiently. Moving bulk power efficiently across regions will demand more substations, more support for maintaining stable voltage and more high-voltage direct current backbones than are currently funded or planned. The investment exists on paper, but the physical infrastructure lags years behind where it needs to be to support the generation capacity that is either already built or under construction. The constraints are already affecting major renewable developers in concrete ways. Reliance has land banks suitable for well over 100 gigawatts of solar capacity, but the ability to connect to the grid is the choke point affecting actual deployment of these projects. Its first 690 megawatt application at Khavda, a village in Bhuj Taluka of Kutch district, was granted connection capacity only by 2030, three years later than requested and larger blocks open from 2032 onward. Data-centre developers cannot sit in a transmission queue for years waiting for grid connectivity to materialize. They will gravitate toward firm electrons and existing infrastructure, not promises of future capacity that may or may not arrive on schedule. Energy storage is attempting to fill the gap between when solar generates and when demand peaks, but the scale required is enormous. Peak-week modelling suggests India could require roughly 530 gigawatt-hours of energy storage by fiscal year 2032, with about 420 gigawatt-hours plausibly delivered by batteries on current pipelines versus roughly 240 gigawatt-hours in government guidance. Battery pack prices have fallen roughly a third over the last two years, making solar-plus-storage economically viable for shifting midday power to early evening hours and covering short peaks that were uneconomic before. At multi-hundred-gigawatt-hour scale, supply chains, financing and siting still constrain deployment speed in ways that make it difficult to build fast enough. Storage is a powerful complement to transmission and flexibility, not a replacement for either, and it cannot by itself solve the problem of evening demand. Natural gas looks like a textbook bridge fuel on paper, offering the flexibility and reliability that the system needs. Except that cost and availability work against it in practice in the Indian context. Even under prospective liquefied natural gas gluts on global markets, gas-fired generation sits higher on India’s merit order than coal because of fuel pricing dynamics that have persisted for years. Image and projection: Goldman Sachs Gas will find a role as peaking capacity and locational reliability, especially where transmission infrastructure and urban substations are running at their limits, but it will not underwrite the nation’s evening ramp at scale on current economics. The math simply does not work at the volumes required to make a meaningful difference in the overall power balance. Time-of-day tariffs, interruptible contracts for large users and automated demand response can shave the peak and reduce the need for new generation capacity if deployed aggressively. These tools should be pursued because they can deliver results faster than building new plants or transmission lines and at a fraction of the capital cost. The political economy resists change in ways that make widespread deployment difficult. Distribution company finances are fragile, tariff reform is jagged and politically contentious, and enforcing sharp evening prices on voters is rarely a career-enhancing move for state governments that depend on those votes. Without that price signal, smart loads remain a pilot program rather than a resource at scale that can materially affect the peak demand problem. Institutions will decide the pace as much as technology does, determining which solutions can be deployed and how quickly they can scale. The Central Electricity Authority and Central Electricity Regulatory Commission set operating norms that determine how low coal plants can be run, how quickly they must ramp and what flexibility investments can be recovered through tariffs. State distribution companies control connection timelines and local capital expenditure decisions that affect every project. They also ration pain through load-shedding rather than pay for upgrades that stress their balance sheets and require politically difficult tariff increases. Land acquisition and right-of-way rules for the interstate transmission system pit national priorities against local politics and immediate constituent concerns in ways that delay projects for years. Open-access permissions, banking rules, and cross-subsidy surcharges tilt corporate buyers toward captive generation solutions instead of grid-beneficial ones that would help the broader system but offer less certainty to individual companies. China’s solution to data-centre load has been a coal-plus-renewables tandem buttressed by ultra-high-voltage transmission lines that move power thousands of kilometres across the country. The country built firm capacity and a long-haul backbone first, then stacked wind and solar behind it once the grid could handle the variability. It is not clean by any measure, but it is stable and predictable in ways that enable industrial planning. Texas offers a cautionary mirror on the other end of the spectrum: a torrent of wind and solar capacity, relatively light interconnections between regions, and a price-only market that invites curtailment and volatility during extreme weather events. That system is now being partly tempered by a wave of battery installations, but the integration challenges remain significant. India cannot copy either model wholesale given its own institutional constraints and geography, but the lesson is the same everywhere. Get the transmission infrastructure and the operating rules right before promising 24-hour clean power to compute campuses that require uninterrupted supply. Most commentary fixates on long-distance transmission lines as the primary constraint limiting renewable deployment. The near-term crunch may actually be distribution infrastructure at the local level, which receives less attention but creates immediate bottlenecks. Data-centre parks and peaking plants need substations at various voltage levels, high-capacity feeders, and fault-level upgrades inside cities already operating at thermal and political limits. Who pays becomes key in determining what gets built and when: developers via hefty connection charges, or distribution companies via capital expenditure they can barely finance given their debt loads and tariff constraints. Connection queues and local reinforcement requirements may add as much delay as the interstate lines that dominate public discussion, creating a two-tier bottleneck that affects different projects in different ways. Avoiding a false binary choice is essential when considering how much coal versus everything else the system needs to manage the transition. A plausible fiscal year 2035 mix that manages the evening peak includes several components working together in ways that complement rather than substitute for each other. A large block of new coal capacity operating flexibly during the 6 PM to 11 PM hours when demand surges past what renewables can provide. An upgraded legacy fleet with lower minimum operating levels to absorb midday solar without destabilising the grid’s frequency or forcing curtailment. Hundreds of gigawatt-hours of batteries shaving intraday swings and covering the first hour of the peak before other sources take over. A modest wedge of gas for location-specific reliability and fast start capability where transmission constraints prevent coal from serving certain areas. A growing contribution from time-of-day tariffs and demand response as state politics allow and distribution companies become more financially stable. The exact shares will move with prices, weather patterns and policy choices as the decade progresses, but the direction is clear regardless of which specific path policymakers choose. India will add coal to buy time for transmission, storage and demand-side tools to catch up with the modern economy’s arrival, even as it continues building renewable capacity at record rates. The digital economy is arriving faster than the physical grid can adapt to handle its demands. Transmission lines take years to plan, approve, and construct under the best circumstances. Solar panels go dark at the worst moment for system reliability, creating precisely the gap that needs to be filled. Batteries are powerful tools but not yet cheap enough at the scale required to make evening peaks disappear entirely, despite the dramatic cost declines of recent years. Hydroelectric plants and nuclear reactors face long lead times and public resistance that delay their contribution to the grid mix, often by a decade or more from initial proposal to operation. Given these timelines, the dependence on high-carbon baseload power will rise before it falls, creating a period where emissions may increase even as renewable capacity expands. Policymakers cannot pretend otherwise or deny the contradiction between clean energy goals and near-term infrastructure realities. Thanks for reading India Dispatch! Subscribe to receive new posts.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

These include political rallies, electoral campaign events, religious processions, protest marches, demonstrations, and cultural or nationalist gatherings. In other instances, they are organized with the express objective of harassing minorities. In 2024, the Indian general election, state elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, and hate rallies triggered by exaggerated claims of violence against Hindus in Bangladesh served as key catalysts for a significant proportion of hate speech incidents. Hate speech in India in 2024 followed an alarming trajectory, deeply intertwined with the ideological ambitions of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the broader Hindu nationalist movement. The number of hate speech incidents targeting religious minorities surged from 668 in 2023 to 1,165 in 2024, marking a staggering 74.4% increase. Dangerous speech—defined as speech that \"increases the risk that its audience will condone or participate in violence against members of another group\"—also saw a significant rise. Patterns of hate speech in 2024 reflect both continuity and transformation in its context and content with longstanding Hindu nationalist tropes remaining dominant—such as the portrayal of Muslims and Christians as “outsiders” in Hindu India and Muslims as a threat to Hindus. Hate speeches frequently invoked the narrative of Muslims as \"infiltrators,\" linked to thinly veiled allegations of all Indian Muslims as Bangladeshi migrants or Rohingya refugees. Hindu far-right leaders demonized Indian Muslims as parasitic and thieving, alleging that they were either wrongfully granted resources that rightfully belonged to Hindus or were stealing Hindu wealth through acts of aggression. These rhetorical shifts reinforced exclusionary narratives, further escalating anti-minority sentiment and hostility. Social media platforms—Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Telegram, and X (formerly Twitter)—have been key instruments in enabling, amplifying, and mainstreaming hate speech and extremist ideologies, both in India and globally. In the Indian context, these platforms have been extensively utilized to articulate and spread Hindu nationalist ideology and anti-minority rhetoric. Of the 1,165 in-person hate speech events targeting Muslim and Christian minorities in 2024, 995 videos were traced back to their original sources on social media, where they were first uploaded or live streamed. Given the logic of virality, social media platforms facilitate the rapid and widespread circulation of hateful content while also elevating the most extreme instances of hate speech through algorithmic amplification. Despite their own community standards prohibiting hate speech, social media platforms failed to enforce their guidelines, allowing violative content to spread unchecked. Viewed cumulatively, shifts in hate speech patterns in 2024 reinforced and amplified the core tenets of the Hindu nationalist worldview, that is, the idea of India as an exclusively Hindu nation with minorities, especially Muslims and Christians, as perpetual outsiders. The sharp spike in the rise of hate speech events points to the incorporation of hate speech as part of routine electoral politics and campaign strategy. It is also indicative of an increasingly aggressive assertion of Hindu nationalism in public and political life. As of 2024, Hindu nationalism has taken on a much more extreme form, with its rhetoric becoming more blatant, inflammatory, and violent. Marking a continuity with past trends, hate speech in 2024 contributed to an environment where increasingly egregious expressions of hate and violence against Indian minorities continued to be normalized. **Keywords:** India, Hate Speech, Hindu nationalism, India Hate Lab, Center for the Study of Organized Hate, Narendra Modi, T Raja Singh, Himanta Biswa Sarma, Indian Muslims, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal, Bharatiya Janata Party, Nitesh Rane **Suggested Citation:** [Suggested Citation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5130832) Lab, India Hate, **Report 2024: Hate Speech Events in India** (February 10, 2025).

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 October 2024 By Sema Hasan, Senior Policy Analyst Increasing Abuses against Religious Minorities in India Introduction Religious freedom conditions in India have continued to worsen throughout 2024, particularly in the months prior to and immediately following the country’s national elections. In addition to the enforcement of discriminatory state-level legislation and propagation of hateful rhetoric, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government made a concerted effort to implement election promises that negatively and disproportionately impacted religious minorities and their ability to practice their faith. Such promises included enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), inaugurating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and introducing a national code to replace religion-specific personal laws. Each action was justified by government officials as necessary to protect India’s “cultural [and] linguistic heritage”—a common euphemism for Hindu supremacy, often at the expense of religious minorities. This report provides an overview of the various religious freedom violations that have taken place in India during 2024. It focuses on changes to the country’s legal framework, including the strengthening of discriminatory legislation like state-level anti-conversion and anti-terrorism laws, as well as the implementation of the CAA and the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). It also examines the increasing frequency of attacks against religious minorities and their advocates, including the targeting of places of worship. Laws and Other Challenges to Religious Freedom at the National Level The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) In May 2024, the Indian government published the rules for implementing the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), fulfilling a long-anticipated BJP campaign promise. Amending the country’s 1955 Citizenship Act, the CAA established a religious criterion for fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants (from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, or Christian communities) fleeing neighboring Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The law excludes Muslim refugees, including Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka. The act states that an individual must have lived or worked in India prior to December 31, 2014, in order to apply for citizenship. www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov Stephen Schneck Chair Eric Ueland Vice Chair Commissioners Mohamed Elsanousi Maureen Ferguson Susie Gelman Vicky Hartzler Asif Mahmood Meir Soloveichik Erin D. Singshinsuk Executive Director USCIRF’s Mission To advance international freedom of religion or belief, by independently assessing and unflinchingly confronting threats to this fundamental right. 2 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Critics argue that the CAA violates the Indian constitution’s principles prohibiting religious discrimination and its guarantees of equal protection under the law. Mass protests followed the initial announcement in 2019, in which hundreds were injured and thousands arrested—some of whom remained in detention as of September 2024, including Umar Khalid, Meeran Haider, and Sharjeel Imam. The recent announcement of the implementation rules initiated a surge of new protests as well as a number of petitions challenging the CAA before the Supreme Court. Several Indian states have expressed opposition to the CAA. In 2019, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh all moved resolutions against the CAA. In February 2024, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu stressed that he would not allow implementation of the CAA in that state, as he would “stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan brethren.” Similarly, in March, the chief minister of West Bengal voiced her opposition to the act, arguing that it would be used to “turn legal citizens into foreigners.” Kerala was the first state to legally challenge the CAA and in March renewed its 2020 plea before the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the law’s classification based on religion and country is discriminatory. In June, the Madhya Pradesh government granted Indian citizenship to three applicants under the CAA. National Register of Citizens (NRC) Human rights advocates argue that the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in combination with the CAA, would allow the Indian government to expel those it deemed noncitizens, posing particular risk to the country’s Muslim population. The government first piloted the NRC in Assam in 2018, when it sought to separate Indian citizens from “undocumented immigrants” living in that state. The NRC requires residents to prove they or their ancestors had entered Assam prior to March 24, 1971, or face exclusion from the register. In 2019, the Assam government published its list of names of those it considered Indian citizens according to the NRC, omitting 1.9 million names. Of these 1.9 million, an estimated 700,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Bengali Hindus, and 200,000 were from the Assamese Hindu groups Koch-Rajbongshi, Das, Kalita, and Sarma. In July 2024, the Assam government ordered police to cease referring people entitled to Indian citizenship— under the CAA—to Foreigners’ Tribunals, which function as quasi-judicial bodies that authorities task with determining whether an individual is a “suspected foreigner.” Despite this order, police in Assam that same month, in conjunction with the Foreigners’ Tribunals, declared 28 Muslims as “non-citizens” and sent them to a deportation center. In September, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that all individuals must submit an NRC application in order to receive identity cards. New Delhi India USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 3 Expropriation and Demolition of Places of Worship and Muslim Property Since the beginning of 2024, Indian authorities have facilitated the expropriation of places of worship, including the construction of Hindu temples on the sites of mosques. Most notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in January, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Indian authorities had constructed the temple atop the ruins of the Babri Masjid, which a Hindu mob had demolished in 1992 in their belief that it marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site was long contested; India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the mosque’s destruction was an “egregious violation” of the law and yet granted the site to Hindus while offering Muslims a separate plot of land to construct a new mosque—which remains unbuilt as of September 2024. The days following the temple’s January 2024 consecration were marked by a series of attacks and other instances of intolerance against religious minorities across six states. In each instance, violence erupted following Hindu nationalist processions through predominantly Muslim neighbors. In Maharashtra, violence broke out along Mira Road, where police stood by as mobs vandalized dozens of Muslim-owned shops. Several reports indicate that the police arrested Muslim youths, despite receiving dozens of complaints against the actions of the Hindu mob. In the aftermath of the Mira Road violence, municipal authorities returned with bulldozers to demolish structures they deemed illegal. Commonly referred to as “bulldozer justice,” state authorities have repeatedly used bulldozers to demolish Muslim property under the guise of removing “illegal” structures, including homes, businesses, and places of worship. In February, for example, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the 600-year-old Akhoondji Mosque, alleging that the building was an illegal encroachment. The mosque’s imam argued that he did not receive written notice before the demolition. The DDA has also announced its intention to demolish 20 religious structures in the forested areas of Sanjay Van, including 16 Muslim shrines. A court order claimed that Delhi “already had sufficient dargahs and temples” and that the forest needed restoration. The same month, in Uttarakhand, the demolition of a mosque and Muslim seminary by police and government officials sparked deadly clashes and an internet shutdown. In July, the DDA demolished the Faizyab Mosque and Madrassa in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area. Places of Worship Act Beyond demolitions, the government has expropriated several mosques for alternative purposes, directly violating India’s Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. The 1991 act froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed in August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith. While the act does not apply to the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, it extends protection to all other places of worship. Despite this law, an Indian court ruled in February that Hindus can worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, which Hindus claim rests on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The same month, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav called for the repeal of the Places of Worship Act, calling it “unconstitutional.” Waqf Amendment Bill In addition, many Muslims have expressed concern regarding the Indian government’s introduction of the Waqf Amendment Bill in August, which seeks to repeal the 1995 Waqf Act. A waqf is an endowment (movable or immovable) that Muslims can give for a specific pious or charitable purpose, according to Islamic tradition. Once registered as a waqf, such property—which may include land, graveyards, or buildings—is deemed nontransferable and held in perpetuity as such. All mosques in India are considered waqf properties, under the management of Muslim bodies in every state, known as Waqf Boards. The 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to broaden the government’s regulatory authority over these endowments and proposes the mandatory inclusion of non-Muslim members on Waqf Boards. It also seeks to prohibit the designation of a given property as a waqf based on its owner’s oral declaration alone. Legal experts and Muslim leaders argue that these provisions would erode their community’s autonomy over its own religious institutions. The introduction of this legislation follows the increased proliferation of disinformation regarding the distribution of wealth among India’s Muslim communities, including derogatory comments that Prime Minister Modi made during the national election. 4 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 State and Local Laws Impacting Religious Minorities Uniform Civil Code and Personal Status Laws Since 2019, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have articulated their intention to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to overrule existing personal laws that are highly integrated with religious beliefs. Such personal laws include areas such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession. Critics argue that a UCC would contradict secular principles while failing to adequately represent the needs and values of the country’s myriad and diverse religious communities. In February, the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand passed a state-level UCC bill, establishing a uniform set of rules on personal status law that includes marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. This bill is widely considered to represent a template for other states to adopt. The UCC sets the minimum age for marriage at 18. While Hindu and secular laws set age restrictions for men and women, there are no such limitations for Muslims and other communities. Some Muslim communities have characterized the UCC as a threat to Islamic practices, preferring to observe Shari’a as the basis for personal law, and some Sikh organizations have similarly rejected it, arguing that it “undermines Sikh identity.” The UCC further requires “live-in” relationships to be registered within a month and establishes criminal punishments, including six months in jail, for failing to do so. Such provisions would allow for further policing of interfaith couples, who already face risks including threats of violence from family members. In July, for example, the Uttarakhand high court directed police to provide protection to an interfaith couple in a live-in relationship and instructed them to register under the UCC. The couple reported receiving threats from their parents about their relationship. Anti-Conversion Laws In addition to the UCC and other legislation, authorities frequently used state-level policies throughout the first part of 2024, including anti-conversion laws, to target religious minorities across India. As USCIRF previously reported, 12 of India’s 28 states currently maintain anti\u0002conversion laws and enforce them to varying degrees. These laws prohibit conversion under circumstances that far exceed cases of coercion, and they are often punishable by hefty fines and prison terms. Authorities frequently enforce such laws under the pretext of preventing so-called “love jihad”—a conspiracy theory that claims Muslim men target and seduce Hindu women for conversion to Islam—while in effect targeting interfaith relationships. Since the beginning of the year, authorities have arrested dozens of Christians on allegations of conducting or participating in forced conversions. In June, for example, police in Uttar Pradesh detained 13 Christians, including four pastors; in July, seven Christians faced accusations of violating the state’s anti-conversion law in two separate incidents. That same month, government officials from Uttar Pradesh tabled a bill that would strengthen the state’s anti-conversion law, including expanding the punishment for conversion to life imprisonment, allowing anyone to file a First Instance Report (FIR) against suspected violators, and making religious conversion a nonbailable offense. Several other states made similar efforts to introduce or strengthen existing anti-conversion laws. In February, for example, the state of Chhattisgarh announced it would introduce legislation to address “illegal conversion,” claiming that Christian pastors had forcibly converted Hindus. In February, the Assam government passed the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Bill, which bans individuals or groups from performing “non\u0002scientific” healing, such as prayer, to treat illnesses. The chief minister of Assam further noted his intention to restrict Christian evangelism and conversion in the state with the bill. In April, the government of Gujarat issued a circular mandating that Hindus wishing to convert to Buddhism, Sikhism, or Jainism obtain approval from their district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. In June, the BJP-led government in Rajasthan withdrew its 2008 anti-conversion law in favor of new legislation aimed at “curbing alleged cases of ‘love jihad’” and religious conversion. Additionally, as of August, appeals challenging the constitutionality of anti\u0002conversion laws were pending in seven states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Anti-Cow Slaughter Laws India’s constitution directs states to take steps to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, considered sacred in Hinduism. As a result, 20 of India’s 28 states currently enforce anti-cow slaughter laws. Vigilante groups and self-proclaimed “cow protectors” frequently exploit such laws to target religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits. USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 5 An estimated dozen attacks involving “cow vigilantism” took place following India’s national elections in June. In August, for example, a group of cow vigilantes beat a Muslim migrant worker to death, falsely accusing him of having eaten beef. A day later, a group of Hindu men violently attacked a 72-year-old Muslim man because they believed he was carrying beef in his bag. The same month, a group of “cow protectors” shot and killed a 19-year-old Hindu student because they thought he was a Muslim smuggling cows. While arrests were made in each of these cases, perpetrators of such attacks often operate with impunity; they rarely face punishment and are often released on bail within 24 hours. Other Significant Religious Freedom Challenges across India Hate Speech, Misinformation and Disinformation In the leadup to the June 2024 elections, political officials increasingly wielded hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims and other religious minorities. Prime Minister Modi repeatedly claimed that the opposition party would “wipe out [the] Hindu faith from the country” and had plans to make Hindus “second class citizens in their own country.” He perpetuated hateful stereotypes about Muslims, referring to them as “infiltrators.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah echoed these statements and insisted falsely that opposition leaders would impose Shari’a if elected—despite the fact that the opposition election manifesto included no mention of Shari’a or Muslims. Additionally, misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech by Indian government officials frequently fuel and incite cow vigilantism and other attacks against religious minorities. The attacks against Muslims in Mira Road following the inauguration of the Ram Temple in January, for example, erupted following inflammatory speeches by two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain. Rane reportedly openly threatened the Muslim community, using offensive language and urging the Hindu community to “ignite and retaliate.” While First Instance Reports (FIRs) were filed against Rane and Jain, Mumbai police argued in July that the use of terms like “jihadis,” “Rohingya,” and “Bangladeshis” were not aimed at the Muslim community and therefore did not fall under Section 295A of the penal code. The same month, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about an increase in hate speech targeting Rohingya refugees and the Indian government’s role in arbitrary mass detention and forcible return of that community to Burma. Following Rane and Jain’s speeches, BJP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) T. Raja Singh gave a 40-minute speech in February stoking religious tensions, in which he openly called for violence against Muslims and for the further demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura. Singh claimed that Muslims were facilitating the forceful conversion of Hindus and repeatedly referred to Rohingya and Bangladeshi Muslims as “illegal.” He encouraged his audience to be “prepared to fight for the protection of our country and religion” and to fight against “love jihad,” forced conversion, and cow slaughter. Attacks against Religious Minorities In March, a group of UN experts raised alarm about the level of violence and hate crimes against religious minorities in the leadup to national elections, including vigilante violence, targeted and arbitrary killings, demolition of property, and harassment. They called on the Indian government to fulfill its obligation to prohibit religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and violence. From January to March 161 incidents of violence against Christians in India were reported—47 of which occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh. Such incidents ranged from violent attacks on churches and prayer meetings to physical assaults, harassment, and false allegations of forced conversion. Muslims continued to be targeted, as well. In March, a group of Hindus in Gujarat violently attacked foreign Muslim university students as they gathered for prayer during Ramadan. The university subsequently issued new guidelines, instructing students not to pray in common spaces. Moreover, following the election results, during which the BJP lost its national majority, at least 28 attacks against Muslims occurred from June to August. Religious educational institutions were also subjected to harassment and targeting. In February, for example, Hindu organizations entered a Catholic school in Assam and demanded instructors cease using Christian images and symbols. In March, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment striking down a previous ruling on the governance of madrasas, effectively banning Islamic schools in that state and ordering the public school enrollment of students whom the closures had impacted. 6 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Crackdown on Civil Society and Faith-Based Organizations In 2024 the government of India has expanded its tactics of repression to target religious minorities and their advocates abroad. Journalists, academics, and civil society organizations documenting India’s religious freedom violations have reported facing denial of consular services, including the revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards as well as threats of violence and surveillance. In April, international reporting linked an official in India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to the 2023 assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist in New York. Additionally, Indian authorities have repeatedly used discriminatory legislation to target religious communities and those advocating on their behalf. Authorities continued to exploit antiterror and financing laws, including the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to crack down on civil society organizations, religious minorities, human rights defenders, and journalists reporting on religious freedom. The UAPA was enacted in 1967 but amended in 2019, allowing the government to designate individuals as “terrorists” without due process. The law vaguely defines “unlawful activity” as any action “intended to disrupt India’s sovereignty, integrity or security,” including “disruptive speech.” In 2024, several religious minorities and human rights activists have continued to face detention without trial under the UAPA, including Hany Babu and Rona Wilson. Academic and human rights activist GN Saibaba, whom authorities detained under the UAPA in 2017 for criticizing state violence against religious minorities, was ultimately released in March but described how police had abused him, tortured him, and denied him medical care while in custody. Similarly, organizations that document and advocate for religious freedom continue to face harassment and, in some cases, are forced to shut down operations. Like the UAPA, authorities have used India’s Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to obstruct the work of civil society organizations. FCRA regulates access to foreign funds for individuals and organizations and prohibits receipt of foreign funds for “any activities [deemed] detrimental to the national interest” of India. The law requires nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to apply for FCRA licenses to received foreign funding, but authorities can readily revoke such licenses. In April, India’s Home Ministry canceled the FCRA licenses of five NGOs, preventing them from using existing funds. Those NGOs included the Church of North India (CNI) Synodical Board of Social Service, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, and Evangelical Fellowship of India. In total, the Indian government has canceled over 20,000 FCRA registrations since 2012. Replacing India’s Criminal Code In July, the Indian government moved to replace its colonial-era criminal laws with three new laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA). These laws replaced the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1872 Indian Evidence Act, respectively. Human rights groups argue that the enforcement of these new laws may have exacerbated the targeting of religious minorities and their advocates. Such legislation may pose an additional threat to freedom of expression, association, and right to a free trial, particularly for religious minorities. The BNS specifically adds a new provision criminalizing “acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India” and increases the minimum punishment from three years to seven. It also expands the criminalization of the promotion of “enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion” to include electronic communications. Reporting indicates that this provision has already served as a pretext for targeting journalists who reported on an alleged mob lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh. The BNSS additionally allows for police to seek 15-day detention of an accused individual at any time before they have completed 40–60 days of the allowed remand period. UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief. Professional Staff Michael Ardovino Policy Analyst Susan Bishai Senior Policy Analyst Mollie Blum Policy Analyst Guillermo Cantor Director of Research and Policy Elizabeth K. Cassidy Senior Strategic Advisor Mingzhi Chen Supervisory Policy Advisor Patrick Greenwalt Policy Analyst Sema Hasan Senior Policy Analyst Thomas Kraemer Chief Administrative Officer Veronica McCarthy Public Affairs Associate Hilary Miller Policy Analyst Nora Morton Operations Specialist Dylan Schexnaydre Policy Analyst Scott Weiner Supervisory Policy Analyst Luke Wilson International Legal Specialist Kurt Werthmuller Deputy Director of Research and Policy Nathan Wineinger Chief of Public Affairs Jean Wu Policy Analyst Conclusion Religious freedom conditions in India continue to follow a deteriorating and concerning trajectory. The Indian government continues to repress and restrict religious communities through the enforcement of discriminatory legislation like anti-conversion laws, cow slaughter laws, and antiterrorism laws. In doing so, authorities have arbitrarily detained individuals highlighting violations of religious freedom, including religious leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, without due process—in some cases for years. Indian officials have repeatedly employed hateful and derogatory rhetoric and misinformation to perpetuate false narratives about religious minorities, inciting widespread violence, lynchings, and demolition of places of worship. In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in particularly severe religious freedom violations. This report further outlines a number of policy recommendations that the U.S. government can take to address religious freedom violations in India, including issuing targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, conditioning arms sales based on improved religious freedom conditions, and incorporating religious freedom priorities into bilateral meetings with Indian government counterparts.",

    "title": "India-US Trade Rift: Scenarios, Spillovers and Strategic Shifts",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Economics \\| 2 min read \\| September 2025 # India-US Trade Rift: Scenarios, Spillovers and Strategic Shifts As the standoff between the two countries continues, we analyze likely scenarios, macro spillovers, and India's countercyclical and strategic response - Tensions between India and the United States have risen, after the latter imposed a 50% tariff rate - The power balance tilts towards the US, but India also has a large consumer market, provides opportunities for US in defense and energy sectors and acts as a strategic counterweight to China - Higher US tariffs are a near-term growth drag, but they will trigger diversification and further reforms. We expect India’s global value chain integration to be disrupted, rather than derailed by these tariffs Since US President Donald Trump’s imposition of a 50% tariff rate on India (25% reciprocal tariff plus a 25% Russia penalty), the standoff between India and the Unites States has continued. In this article, we look at possible scenarios and medium-term implications in light of these tariffs being implemented. India has maintained a defiant stance on protecting farmers’ interests. Multiple outcomes are possible from here, with different implications. On trade, the US and India have held five rounds of negotiations, where India offered zero tariffs on industrial goods, and agreed to gradually reduce tariffs on US cars, but disagreements emerged over India’s reluctance to open its agriculture (genetically modified crops) and dairy sectors, which are politically important for President Trump. A fundamental misalignment also emerged between the two nations' approaches: India sought a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement, while it appears the Trump administration preferred a quick deal. India's response has been notably resolute across multiple fronts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emphasized unwavering protection of farmers' interests, even at personal cost, and has encouraged citizens to buy goods domestically. Within India, both opposition leaders and business community representatives have rallied behind the government's position, accepting short-term economic pain over perceived international pressure. In our base case, we assume the 25% reciprocal tariff remains in place through FY26, but the 25% Russian penalty is effective only until November. As such, we expect GDP growth at 6.6% y-o-y in FY26, after considering other policy offsets. On the other hand, if both sides dig in their heels, resulting in a continuation of the 50% tariff rate, then we would expect the hit to GDP growth to be 0.8 percentage points on an annualized rate basis. The current account deficit is also likely to deteriorate to around 1.1% of GDP. We see significant spillovers hitting investment and consumption through job losses in export intensive sectors, with further escalation risks through tariffs or non-tariff barriers. With the new tariff structure, the cost differential between India and China has narrowed, and between India and Southeast Asian competitors, it has moved in favor of the latter. This could have various effects on the shape of new supply chains such as the negative impact on textiles, leather and toys, and Indian firms possibly relocating their production to lower tariff countries to retain their US customer base. However, this will merely disrupt global value chain integration for India, not derail it entirely. We expect the government to announce a multi-pronged response, with fiscal and financial support for exporters, focus on export diversification and fast-tracking free trade agreements. More reforms are also likely. Goods and services tax rationalization has already been announced, and we expect further reforms such as FDI liberalization, deregulation, factor market reforms, privatization, and administrative reforms.

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

(PRABIN RANABHAT/AFP via Getty Images) The growing momentum of youth-led and anti-elite movements across South Asia signals that political transitions in the region are far from settled. As traditional power structures weaken, new political actors are emerging. Governments will likely face increasing pressure to demonstrate democratic accountability and deliver economic gains despite fiscal constraints, heightening the risk of policy volatility and unevenly distributed benefits. Over the longer term, these shifts could reshape the region's political order, encouraging greater popular participation and institutional reform while straining governments' capacity to maintain cohesion and deliver consistent policy outcomes.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Project developers allege that due to a lack of adequate transmission infrastructure to carry the electricity they generate, dozens of commissioned plants, ready to feed power into the grid, are being forced to sit idle and incur losses. “Between March and August 2025, at least 30 solar and wind plants faced curtailment, with combined losses of up to Rs 700 crore,” chief commercial officer with a renewable project told _Down To Earth_ ( _DTE_), requesting anonymity. Experts say such curtailment is shaking investor confidence and could jeopardise India’s target of installing 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based electricity capacity by 2030. The Union Ministry of Power is responsible for laying transmission lines or upgrading existing ones when approving power projects—whether coal-based or renewable. Once a plant is commissioned, it requires general network access (GNA) from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to begin transmission. However, GNA has not been issued to several newly commissioned solar and wind power plants in the high-generation states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, according to manufacturers who spoke with _DTE_ on condition of anonymity. These plants are instead granted temporary general network access (TGNA). This temporary access, usually valid for up to 11 months, allows electricity to be fed into the grid, but only when there is low supply to the lines. “During the six months till August 2025, we were instructed by the Grid Controller of India to embrace curtailments of up to 48 per cent of our daily production... _This article was originally published in the October 1-15, 2025 print edition of_ Down To Earth [To Continue Reading Subscribe Now](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/subscription) [Renewable Energy](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/renewable-energy) [Solar Energy](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/solar-energy) [Wind Energy](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/wind-energy) [electricity transmission](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/electricity-transmission) Show Comments ## Related Stories No stories found.

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India...",

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

Equity securities may fluctuate in value and can decline significantly in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions. Bonds generally present less short-term risk and volatility than stocks, but contain interest rate risk (as interest rates raise, bond prices usually fall); issuer default risk; issuer credit risk; liquidity risk; and inflation risk. These effects are usually pronounced for longer-term securities. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Currency Risk is a form of risk that arises from the change in price of one currency against another. Whenever investors or companies have assets or business operations across national borders, they face currency risk if their positions are not hedged. Generally, among asset classes, stocks are more volatile than bonds or short-term instruments. Government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate short-term price fluctuations than stocks, but provide lower potential long-term returns. U.S. Treasury Bills maintain a stable value if held to maturity, but returns are generally only slightly above the inflation rate. © 2025 State Street Corporation - All Rights Reserved.

The two countries are close to a short-term trade deal, but a long-term pact is an entirely different proposition. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) The United States' trade war with China grabs all the headlines, but U.S. President Donald Trump is also bearing down on another major Asian economy: India. In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain goods at a reduced tariff rate. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration retaliated by slapping tariffs on 28 U.S. goods. While the sides could soon clinch a short-term trade deal, the United States and India will have several outstanding issues to address before they finalize a more comprehensive pact. With the United States demanding that India reduce its bilateral trade surplus, open its economy to more U.S. agricultural products and go easier on U.S. technology giants, the countries remain far apart on a longer-term deal....

    "full_text": "While the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is attempting to use global trade tensions to strengthen economic integration, the bloc's diversity will limit the extent of this effort even as, over time, common concern about export dependencies on the United States will drive ASEAN members to seek alternative trading partners. On May 26-27, Malaysia, as the 2025 ASEAN chair, hosted a series of summits that underscored ASEAN's broad dual-track initiatives to bolster intra-bloc trade and trade diversification. The 46th ASEAN Summit, convened on May 26, brought together leaders from the ten-member bloc and produced a new five-year strategic plan aimed at deepening economic integration among member states, with goals such as further harmonizing trade standards, enhancing financial integration and promoting sustainable economic practices.
