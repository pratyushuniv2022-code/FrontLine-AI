It amends the [Citizenship Act of 1955](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_nationality_law) to grant a swifter path to Indian citizenship under the assumption of [religious persecution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_persecution) to any individual belonging to the specific minorities of [Hindus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus), [Sikhs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs), [Buddhists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist), [Jains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain), [Parsis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsis) and Christians from [Afghanistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan), [Bangladesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh) and [Pakistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan), who entered India on or before 31 December 2014.[\\[108\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-108) The Act also seeks to relax the requirement of residence in India for citizenship by [naturalisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalisation) from 11 years to 5 years for migrants covered under the Act.[\\[109\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-109) However, the Act does not mention Muslims and does not offer the same eligibility benefits to Muslim immigrants or immigrants belonging to other religions from those countries.[\\[110\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-Samuel-110) The Act also does not mention any benefits for various other refugees which form the bulk of the refugees living in India, such as [Sri Lankan Tamil refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils_in_India) who faced persecution during the [Sri Lankan Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War),[\\[111\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-111) [Rohingya refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_Refugee_Crisis) who were victims of the [Rohingya genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_genocide), [Nepali refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutanese_refugees) who faced [ethnic cleansing in Bhutan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing_in_Bhutan), and [Tibetan Buddhist refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_refugees_in_India) who faced persecution in China.[\\[112\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-WPCitizenship22-112) According to the [Intelligence Bureau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_Bureau_(India)), the immediate beneficiaries of the new law will be 25,447 Hindus, 5,807 Sikhs, 55 Christians, 2 Buddhists and 2 Parsis.[\\[113\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-angry22-113) ### Response [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests&action=edit&section=3) The passage of the Act sparked massive protests in India.[\\[110\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-Samuel-110) Protesters in [Assam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam) and other [northeastern states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_India) oppose the grant of [Indian citizenship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_citizenship) to any refugee or immigrant, regardless of their religion, because they fear it would alter the region's demographic balance. They have campaigned since the 1970s against all refugees, and they fear that the new law will cause a loss of their political rights, culture and land.[\\[95\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-BBC_2_Dead-95)[\\[96\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-iexpressassam-96)[\\[97\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-reuters1211-97) They are also concerned that it will trigger more migration from [Bangladesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh) as well as violate the [Assam Accord](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Accord), which was a prior agreement reached with the central government on migrants and refugees.[\\[95\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-BBC_2_Dead-95)[\\[96\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-iexpressassam-96)[\\[97\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-reuters1211-97) After the act was passed, protests in the northeastern region turned violent. Authorities had arrested over 3000 protesters as of 17 December 2019,[\\[73\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-IT_17Dec-73) and some news outlets have described these protests as [riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riots).[\\[114\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-114) Protesters say that the Act violates Clause 5 and Clause 6 of the 1985 [Assam Accord](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Accord).[\\[115\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-115) Critics have stated that the amendment Act is unconstitutional.[\\[116\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-116)[\\[117\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-guardian-117)[\\[118\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-118) The major opposition political parties state that it violates Constitution's Article 14, one that guarantees equality to all. They allege that the new law seeks to make Muslims second-class citizens of India, while preferentially treating non-Muslims in India.[\\[119\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-119) Critics of the Act have also stated that due to the [National Register of Citizens (NRC)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Citizens_of_India), Muslims could be made [stateless](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statelessness), while the Citizenship Amendment Act would be able to shield people with Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian identity as a means of providing them with Indian citizenship even if they fail to prove that they were citizens of India under the stringent requirements of the NRC. Some critics allege that it is a deliberate attempt at [disenfranchising](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfranchisement) and segregating Muslims in line with the [ethnonationalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnonationalist) [Hindutva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva) ideology of the ruling [Bharatiya Janata Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party) (BJP).[\\[120\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-120)[\\[81\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-IEConception-81)[\\[121\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-AsianAgeOrwellian-121) [Tavleen Singh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavleen_Singh) described the Act as India's first [Nuremberg Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws).[\\[122\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-122) The home minister [Amit Shah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah) had previously set a deadline for the implementation of a countrywide NRC by stating that the register would be rolled out before the [2024 Lok Sabha elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Indian_general_election).[\\[123\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-livemint_NRC-123) The Act was criticised by various NGOs, students bodies, and liberal, progressive, and socialist organisations across the country, with the [Indian National Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress) and other major political parties announcing their staunch opposition. Protests led by these groups are concerned that the new law discriminates against Muslims, and believe that Indian citizenship should also be granted to Muslim refugees and immigrants. The states of [Rajasthan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan), West Bengal, [Kerala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala), Maharashtra, [Madhya Pradesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh), Jharkhand[\\[124\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-124) and [Chhattisgarh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhattisgarh) – all ruled by political parties that oppose the BJP – have announced that they will not implement either the [National Register of Citizens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Citizens) (NRC) or the Citizenship Amendment Act. The states of [Bihar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar), Andhra Pradesh and [Odisha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha) have however refused to only implement the NRC, while the state of [Punjab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India) and the union territories of Delhi and [Puducherry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puducherry_(union_territory)) have refused to implement the Act while only expressing disapproval of the NRC.[\\[125\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-125)[\\[126\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-126)[\\[127\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-127) The states of [West Bengal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal) and [Kerala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) have also put a hold on all activities relating to the preparation and update of the [National Population Register](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Population_Register) which is necessary for the Census as well as the implementation of the [National Register of Citizens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Citizens).[\\[128\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-128) Although some of the states have opposed the Act, the [Union Home Ministry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(India)) clarified that states lack the legal power to stop the implementation of CAA. The Ministry stated that \"The new legislation has been enacted under the Union List of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution. The states have no power to reject it.\"[\\[129\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-Outlook_MP_19_Dec-129) The [Indian Union Muslim League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Union_Muslim_League) and various other bodies have also petitioned the [Supreme Court of India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India) to strike down the Act as illegal and unconstitutional.[\\[130\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-bbc-130) ## Chronology [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests&action=edit&section=4) ### December 2019 [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests&action=edit&section=5) - **4 December** - The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was cleared by the [Union Cabinet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers) for introduction in the parliament.[\\[131\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-131) - After the bill was cleared, violent protests erupted in Assam, especially in [Guwahati](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guwahati), and other areas in the state.[\\[132\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-ET_CAA_12-132) - In [Dispur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispur), several thousands of protesters broke down police barricades to protest in front of the [Assam Legislative Assembly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Legislative_Assembly) building.[\\[133\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-133)[\\[134\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-New_York_Times-134) - Demonstrations were held in [Agartala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agartala).[\\[135\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-135) Six people died and fifty people were injured in the protests against the Act.[\\[136\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-136)[\\[137\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-BBC_16_Dec-137) - **9 December** - The bill was introduced in the [Lok Sabha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha) by the Minister of Home Affairs, [Amit Shah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah).[\\[138\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-138) - **10 December** - The bill was passed with 311 members voting in favour and 80 against.[\\[139\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-139)[\\[140\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-140) - **11 December** - The bill was subsequently passed by the [Rajya Sabha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha) with 125 votes in favour and 105 votes against it.

Critics argue the CAA is discriminatory and undermines indigenous rights . The central government's decision to exclude most tribal areas from the CAA has been met with mixed reactions, as regions like Assam still largely fall outside the Sixth Schedule and are thus not exempted .[\\[603\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-603) Assam, due to its porous borders with Bangladesh, has been particularly affected by illegal immigration, which heightens the controversy surrounding the CAA . Existing student bodies, such as the Northeast Student Union (NESU), have been criticized for their inaction on the issue . In response, the Wesean Student Federation (WSF) was formed in March 2024, advocating for international intervention and urging the United Nations to address the CAA's discriminatory aspects .[\\[604\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-604)[\\[605\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-605) Calls for excluding the entire Northeast from the CAA's purview have been persistent, reflecting widespread regional discontent . In Assam, only areas under the Sixth Schedule, like the Bodoland Territorial Region, are exempt, leaving much of the state vulnerable to the CAA . This discrepancy has sparked questions about the state's policy consistency, as highlighted by All Assam Students Union Chief Advisor Samujjal Bhattacharya .[\\[606\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-606) Efforts to grant Scheduled Tribe status to additional Assamese communities could potentially lead to a tribal-majority state fully exempt from the CAA, though this has not yet materialized . Meanwhile, organizations like the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) are pushing for the implementation of an [Inner Line Permit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Line_Permit) system to further protect against illegal immigration .[\\[607\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-607) ### Other states and union territories [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests&action=edit&section=38) - **Meghalaya:** On 9 December, large scale protests were held in the state.

Vishwanathan, a senior advocate addressed the court, stating \"The most immediate concern now is the sweeping powers given to [executive authorities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)) to brand people as 'doubtful citizens'. Once this is done, there are no guidelines to help these people. This is sinister. It will lead to [gerrymandering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) of electoral rolls. The concern is spread across both the majority Hindus and the minorities as well. You have to address this fear... Otherwise fear and insecurity will pervade the country.\"[\\[290\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-SC_refuses_22_Jan-290) Reacting to the concerns the CJI stated that the laws like the CAA are not irreversible, and the court will hear the interim prayer for a stay on CAA at a future date in February.[\\[290\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-SC_refuses_22_Jan-290) On 3 March, the [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Human_Rights) (OHCHR), filed an application in the Supreme Court and asked to be made a party in the case citing \"the exclusions of persons... on the basis of their religion\". The OHCHR Commissioner, [Michelle Bachelet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Bachelet) said that the \"differentiations\" drawn by the Act are not \"sufficiently objective and reasonable\". However, the [Ministry of External Affairs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)) reacted to the move and said that the CAA is an \"internal matter\" of India and \"no foreign party had any locus standi on issues pertaining to India's sovereignty\".[\\[813\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-813)[\\[348\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-UN_moves_to_SC-348) ## See also [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests&action=edit&section=68) - [India portal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:India) - [Politics portal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Politics) - [Law portal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Law) - [History portal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:History) - [Freedom of speech portal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Freedom_of_speech) - [Society portal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Society) - [2019 Jamia Millia Islamia attack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Jamia_Millia_Islamia_attack) - [2020 JNU Attack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_JNU_Attack) - [Assam Accord](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Accord) - [Assam Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Movement) - [National Register of Citizens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Citizens) - [North East Delhi Riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Delhi_Riots) - [Shaheen Bagh protests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheen_Bagh_protests) ## References [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests&action=edit&section=69) 001. **[^](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_ref-1)**[\"After Aligarh, protests in Hyderabad, Varanasi, Kolkata over Jamia clashes\"](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-aligarh-protests-in-hyderabad-varanasi-kolkata-against-jamia-clashes/story-QdM909mlrIVN1SdWT3zrJI.html). _Hindustan Times_. 16 December 2019.

Of these, the threat posed by Naxalism, a Maoist insurrection active in the eastern half of the country for over four decades, is the most overlooked and analytically neglected in Western academic and security circles. In the past seven years, Naxalite activity has grown in scope, breadth, and violence, in a “Red Corridor” stretching from Nepal to Tamil Nadu, and killed or displaced tens of thousands of people. By 2006, the problem was so severe that India’s Prime Minister characterized the insurgency as the greatest internal security threat ever faced by his country. Given India’s bloody history with separatist and communal violence, such a pronouncement is truly startling. This thesis undertakes an historical analysis of the Naxalite movement to assess how great a danger its current iteration truly poses, and what the implications might be for India’s continued rise. Soberingly, it finds that the insurgency is indeed stronger and more dangerous today than at any time in the past. Furthermore, while it does not pose an existential threat to the state in the same way as its counterpart in Nepal, it will prove extremely disruptive to India’s further growth and development if not swiftly and effectively countered. New Delhi’s efforts in this regard are so far unimpressive, but it is not too late to act. The United States has a vested interest in the emergence of a strong and stable India, and may be able to help its new “strategic partner” address the challenge of Naxalism’s resurgence.

In particular, the guidance and insight of my advisors, Brigadier Feroz Khan and Professor Anshu Chatterjee, were indispensable to my education on South Asian affairs and the successful completion of my thesis. None of this would have been possible, however, without the support of my best friend and the love of my life. She shared in all the ups and downs of a long process, and because of her patience, understanding, and sense of humor, truly deserves much of the credit for the end result. For all this, and so much more – thank you, Marie. THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK xvi 1 I. INTRODUCTION A. PURPOSE “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problem of Naxalism is the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”1 With this startling pronouncement in April 2006, India’s Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, finally drew the West’s attention to an insurgency that had plagued his country for more than four decades, taking nearly 20,000 lives in the process.2 While the world was fixated on the violence in Kashmir, fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and intermittent bouts of Hindu\u0002Muslim sectarian violence, an archaic Maoist ideology, rejected even in the land of its birth, was growing in scope, breadth, and violence. Over the past seven years in particular, Naxalite rebels have come to control large swathes of the Indian countryside in a “Red Corridor” stretching from Nepal to Tamil Nadu and killed thousands of Indian security forces and civilians. This thesis will examine the evolution of the Naxalite threat, from its humble beginnings in 1967 to the present, to ascertain the true danger posed to India’s rise as a twenty-first century Asian power. B. IMPORTANCE Since the end of the Cold War and economic reforms in the early 1990s, India’s performance has been truly staggering. It would be difficult to overstate the key role the country is expected to assume in the global community over the coming decades. With a population of over 1.2 billion, a young, growing, and increasingly educated workforce, and persistent real GDP growth rates in the area of 8 percent over the last decade, India is emerging as a powerful driver of the world economy.3 Its demographic clout and 1 Manmohan Singh, “Prime Minister’s Speech to the 2nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of Chief Ministers on Naxalism,” (speech, New Delhi, India, April 13, 2006), Government of India Press Information Bureau, http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=17128 (accessed August 10, 2007). 2 Jane’s Information Group, “India’s Mosaic of Conflict,” Jane’s Terrorism and Security Monitor, July 14, 2004, http://www8.janes.com/ (accessed August 7, 2007). 3 Ibid. 2 political ambitions are also thrusting it increasingly into positions of international leadership, as the debate on its accession to permanent membership on the UN Security Council attests. If the twenty-first century is truly to be the “Asian Century,” India, along with China, will likely be leading the way. Since the late 1990s, India has also emerged as an increasingly important strategic partner to the United States. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, India was one of the first countries in Asia to extend its support in the Global War on Terror, offering refueling rights to U.S. ships and aircraft on their way toward Afghanistan. The strategic partnership has grown since then, most famously with the 10-year defense accord signed in 2005 and the U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation agreement of 2006.4 The United States has been assiduously cultivating a closer relationship with New Delhi, and greater military and strategic ties between the two countries are clearly important components of future U.S. foreign policy in Asia. However, India’s effectiveness as a world leader and U.S. strategic partner is contingent upon its continued internal stability and economic development. If Naxalism is as great a threat as many believe, its continuing spread will have serious negative repercussions on both fronts, to the detriment of India, the United States, and the larger world. A comprehensive examination and analysis of the phenomenon, and its potential to derail India’s development, is therefore both timely and important. C. LITERATURE REVIEW The Naxalist movement emerged in 1967 as an uprising of disaffected and disenfranchised peasants in Naxalbari, West Bengal. Given its four decade long existence, there is generally a surprising dearth of academic study on the movement. Western scholarship on insurgency in South Asia usually focuses on the conflict in Kashmir and (perhaps surprisingly) the plethora of smaller insurrections in India’s 4 Jane’s Information Group, “Sentinel Security Assessment - South Asia: India, External Affairs,” Jane’s Military and Security Assessments, April 26, 2007, http://www8.janes.com (accessed August 6, 2007). 3 Northeast.5 What little attention is paid to Naxalism is focused almost solely on the underlying causes of insurgent movements in general, treating Naxalism simply as one case in a larger group. Nevertheless, these treatments do provide valuable insight on contributing factors to the movement’s rise and persistence. There seem to be two main schools of thought on this issue. The first is that insurgencies arise out of unmet political demands, usually from a minority that feels it is being oppressed.6 The second school of thought cites economic inequality as a reason for insurgent uprising, typified by the revolts of lower class social groups against what they feel is lack of access to economic gain.7 A third, smaller body of literature stresses the importance of contributing factors, asserting that uprisings are more likely to occur where the terrain provides sanctuary to small groups that can train, equip, and educate their followers outside the reach of government forces.8 In the case of Naxalism, elements of all three theories seem to be at play, and are echoed in the literature from outside the West. Unsurprisingly, the study of the Naxalite movement is more extensive in India itself. Here, however, the problem seems to be not so much a lack of analysis, but the questionable objectivity, quality, and relevance of much of the scholarship. A few works on the early phases of Naxalite activity are extant, but many of these are biased to varying degrees, written by the movement’s sympathizers or even the Maoist revolutionaries themselves.9 Of somewhat greater objectivity are a handful of histories authored by journalists, but their scope, too, is limited to the earliest years of Naxalite 5 Lawrence E.

With respect to more recent analysis, there appears to be relatively little peer- reviewed research on the subject. In its place is a fairly large volume of study, of varying quality, from numerous interested parties and private organizations. While this situation presents a unique opportunity for original research, it also poses the challenge of separating objective, factual analysis from more biased or skewed reporting. Within this latter body of more recent literature, the vast majority of debate focuses on the causes of the current phase of Naxalite insurgency and speculation as to the most effective ways to deal with it. Broadly speaking, two groups with competing viewpoints emerge from all this contention. The first, or “law and order” camp, considers the Naxalite problem primarily a security issue. The main proponents of this point of view are security analysts and researchers like K.P.S. Gill and Ajai Sahni, many of them associated with India-based think tanks like the Institute for Conflict Management.11 While acknowledging socio-economic marginalization as a contributing factor, they view the lack of effective state and municipal policing, poor coordination of security efforts with New Delhi, and lenient policies toward Naxalite groups as the root causes of the insurgency. Citing numerous failed efforts at peace talks with what they view as an intransigent, nihilistic enemy, this group advocates strongly for the active suppression of Naxalism by force, with increased utilization of central government forces if necessary.12 10 For examples, see: Sankar Ghosh, The Naxalite Movement: A Maoist Experiment (Calcutta: Firma K.L. Mukhopadhyay, 1974); Sohail Jawaid, The Naxalite Movement in India: Origin and Failure of the Maoist Revolutionary Strategy in West Bengal 1967-1971 (New Delhi: Associated Publishing House, 1979). 11 The Institute for Conflict Management, “An Introduction,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/icm/index.html (accessed July 19, 2007). 12 Much of the literature generated by these analysts is published on the ‘South Asia Terrorism Portal.’ Organized by K.P.S. Gill, the controversial ‘supercop’ who crushed the Sikh insurgency in Punjab in the early 1990s, the SATP is a comprehensive resource for writings and analysis on terrorism and related security issues in South Asia. In particular, see: K.P.S. Gill, “Imperatives of Justice,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, April 30, 2005, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/07june25pio.htm (accessed July 20, 2007); K.P.S. Gill, “Blood Sweat and Anger,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, July 13, 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/06dailynewsjuly13.htm (accessed July 20, 2007); Ajai Sahni, “The Angry Men of Mao,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, February 4, 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/ajaisahni/dailynews&analysis13022007.htm (accessed July 20, 2007). 5 In contrast, the “development” camp views Naxalism as fundamentally the result of poverty and political disenfranchisement. Represented by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and the Asian Center for Human Rights, and think tanks such as the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, this camp takes a far more holistic attitude toward the most desirable means of combating Naxal violence.13 Stressing the need for poverty reduction, land reform, and better local governance, adherents to this line of reasoning reject government sponsored violence as a solution to the Naxalite problem except in the most extreme circumstances.14 As P. V. Ramana puts it, “If the military option were effective, then the problem should not have resurfaced after the initial Naxalbari uprising was suppressed.”15 Indeed, this group views overly aggressive action on the part of security forces as one of the contributing causes of further radicalization in the countryside. At first blush, the position of Ramana and his cohorts strikes one as an oversimplification of an extremely nuanced security situation. How, for example, is development aid supposed to be distributed if the people in the process of doing so are consistently under the threat of Naxalite attack? The same can be said, however, of the “law and order” argument, and its rather singular emphasis on the use of force to quell an insurgency that doubtless draws much support from the disaffection of the rural poor. Analysis of many prior guerrilla conflicts has certainly drawn attention to the need for addressing the underlying causes of rural discontent in order to draw support away from 13 For examples, see: Asian Centre for Human Rights, “Naxal Conflict in 2006,” Asian Centre for Human Rights Report, http://pdfdownload.bofd.net/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.achrweb.org%2Freports%2Findia% 2FAR07%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Freports%2Findia%2Fnaxal0107.pdf (accessed August 6, 2007); Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, “Left Extremism in India: Naxal Movement in Chattisgarh & Orissa,” Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Special Report 25, June 2006; http://pdftohtml.ganjalinux.org/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipcs.org%2FIPCS-Special\u0002Report-25.pdf (accessed August 6, 2007). 14 Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, “Naxalism and Internal Security in India,” Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Seminar, August 4, 2007, http://www.ipcs.org/newIpcsSeminars2.jsp?action=showView&kValue=2362 (accessed August 6, 2007). 15 Ibid. 6 the insurgent base.16 Additionally, neither group adequately examines the efficacy of previous governmental policies and responses, a rather glaring oversight if one hopes to prescribe a current course of action. Compounding the debate is disagreement on the nature of the threat currently posed by the insurgency. The “law and order” crowd focuses almost exclusively on the movement’s implications for political stability in India, but their analysis tends to be a bit shrill.17 While there has certainly been a greater level of political instability in the regions affected by Naxalism, it has tended to remain in the country’s remote rural areas. Their assertions that the ‘Red Menace’ threatens to split India in two and seriously undermine central authority seems hyperbolic, especially given the fact that the movement draws on, at the most, 10,000 - 20,000 hard-core cadres.18 The “development camp,” by contrast, tends to view the Naxalist threat primarily in terms of its humanitarian dimension. These analysts focus on the recent internal displacement of tens of thousands of rural and tribal peoples, and the atrocities committed by both Maoist rebels and the government security forces, as the insurgency’s greatest dangers.19 While this argument is emotionally compelling, it is by no means clear that this aspect of the threat represents a serious strategic problem for New Delhi in and of itself. India’s population is enormous, and the small percentage directly affected account for only marginal contributions to overall GDP.20 What seem to be greater threats are the larger economic implications of the Naxalite insurgency in the context of India’s growth and development, and its potential for further spread as the social impacts of globalization are felt throughout the country. 16 For an excellent example of this argument, see Jeffrey Race, War Comes to Long An: Revolutionary Conflict in a Vietnamese Province (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1972). 17 Ajai Sahni, “Left Wing Extremism in India: Evolving Strategies for Containment,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, October 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/ajaisahni/crpfdelhi.htm (accessed August 6, 2007). 18 Reuters, “Indian Maoist Violence,” Reuters AlertNet, June 27, 2007, http://www.alertnet.org/printable.htm?URL=/db/crisisprofiles/IN_MAO.htm (accessed August 6, 2007). 19 See the aforementioned Asian Center for Human Rights Report, “Naxal Conflict in 2006” and Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Seminar, “Naxalism and Internal Security in India.” 20 Ibid. 7 As The Economist recently noted, the five states most affected by insurgent violence account for significant mineral deposits and a majority of the nation’s energy resources.21 Also, while Naxalist expansion into the Western and Southern Deccan has received some scrutiny, no serious attention is being given to its possible spread into India’s wild Northeastern states. On initial inspection, the political stability, development level, and demography of this region appear eerily similar to those areas already afflicted by Naxalite violence.22 The fact that the Northeast also contains significant fossil fuel deposits only adds to the threat of the Maoists gaining a foothold.23 Clearly, any worthwhile examination of the dangers posed by Naxalism must take into account the changing nature of the social and economic contexts within which it operates. The analytical oversights and divergences of opinion discussed above are also reflected within the administration in New Delhi, where contradictory statements, confusion, and inconsistent policymaking characterize governmental responses to the most recent Maoist threat.24 As might be expected, these efforts have proven less than effective in countering the Naxalite problem, or even checking its growth in recent years. This manifest intellectual incoherence on the part of leaders, analysts, and policymakers has many causes, but is mainly due to a lack of perspective on the nature of the challenge confronting them. In an examination of the literature on this subject, from all the various points of view, the most striking feature is the absence of any comprehensive historical analysis of the Naxalite movement, the evolution of its organization, aims, and leadership, or how India’s own political, economic, and social development has contributed to (or ameliorated) the virulence of the movement. Given the relatively long lifespan of this 21 Economist, “India’s Politics,” Economist Intelligence Unit ViewsWire, March 19, 2007, http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8875555 (accessed August 7, 2007). 22 Cline, 126-149. 23 Jane’s Information Group, “Sentinel Security Assessment - South Asia: India, Natural Resources,” Jane’s Military and Security Assessments, April 27, 2005, http://www8.janes.com (accessed August 6, 2007). 24 P.V.

With the recent spread of Naxalite activity and the notable concern it has elicited from high levels of the Indian government, this lack of an objective, realistic, and comprehensive examination represents a significant gap in the existing literature on the subject. This thesis will aim to fill that gap. D. METHODOLOGY AND SOURCES This thesis will use the comparative case study method to analyze the evolution of the Naxalite movement and assess the danger posed by the most recent upsurge in Naxalite activity. To draw an important distinction, it will not directly address the veracity of Prime Minister Singh’s assertion that “Naxalism is the single greatest internal security challenge ever faced” by his country. Given the plethora of insurgencies and violent communal movements still active in India, such an assessment would provide enough material for several lengthy theses. Instead, the central question posed here is whether the Naxalite movement currently represents a qualitatively different, and more dangerous, challenge to Indian political stability and development than it has in the past. As mentioned previously, the Naxalite insurgency is not a new phenomenon in India, and has been a thorn in the side of the country for over four decades. Generally speaking, its history can be broken down into three distinct periods, most easily distinguished by their level of insurgent activity and violence. The first period runs from the movement’s beginning in 1967 to its temporary suppression in 1972. This era encompassed the initial organization of the Naxalite movement and the rather rapid spread from its birthplace in West Bengal to a number of other states, notably Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. The second period, from 1972 until about 1991, was notable for the ideological and physical fragmentation of the movement, and its mostly localized activity in pockets of rural India. The third period (perhaps not coincidentally contemporaneous with India’s economic reforms) runs from 1991 to the present, and is distinguished by a process of gradual consolidation, culminating in the merger of the two most powerful insurgent groups (Maoist Communist Center and the 9 People’s War Group) in late 2004.25 The years since 2000 have witnessed the most dramatic escalation in the scope, breadth, and intensity of Naxalite violence. These three periods of activity will comprise the individual cases under investigation. To assess the nature and danger of the insurgency in each era, we will examine how variations in three independent variables (the socio-economic and political milieux, internal characteristics of the Naxalite movement, and governmental response) affected the dependent variable, the overall level of threat posed by the movement. These three cases will then be compared to determine whether or not the Naxalite movement indeed represents a greater danger to India than it has in the past, what specifically that danger is, and how it is likely to develop in the future. Finally, I will explore the implications for India’s continued rise and its prospects as a strategic partner of the United States. Primary and secondary source materials are utilized to the maximum extent practical. Primary sources consist largely of internal documents from the Government of India and Naxalite organizations, as well as quotes and speeches from government and insurgent leaders. As mentioned in the literature review, there is not as much rigorous academic source material on this issue as one might like. What peer-reviewed work there is receives primacy of place, but publications and studies from interested NGOs, think tanks, and security analysts also contain valuable information, and are included in this study. Finally, significant tertiary source material, in the form of coverage from reputable news media like The Economist, Frontline (an Indian weekly), and the Times of India, is required to fill factual gaps in the existing literature. E. TERMINOLOGY ISSUES For the purposes of this thesis, the generic term Maoist will refer to the Indian variety and be used interchangeably with Naxalite. Obviously, Maoist movements and organizations exist in many forms throughout the world and there are a number of others active in South Asia, most famously in Nepal. Other than a shared political ideology and 25 P.V. Ramana, “The Maoist Movement in India,” Defense and Security Analysis 22, no. 4 (December 2006): 435-449. 10 sympathy with each other’s causes, these groups remain separate and distinct entities, and care should be taken not confuse or conflate Naxalism with other Maoist movements more generally. When referring to Maoist organizations other than the Naxalites, the full name and country of origin are provided to avoid ambiguity. 11 II. THE ORGANIZATIONAL PERIOD (1967–1972) A. INTRODUCTION To inform an assessment of the relative threat posed by the current Naxalite insurgency, this chapter will undertake an historical analysis of the movement’s organization and initial activity in the period from 1967 to 1972. This era encompasses the birth of Naxalism and its fairly rapid rise as a force on the Indian political scene, and therefore presents a potentially illuminating parallel to the resurgence of violent Maoism in recent years. It also witnessed the movement’s initial failure, and so may contain useful lessons for countering the modern threat. To begin, a brief look at the history of Indian communism is in order. For the world’s largest democracy, India has a surprisingly long and complicated relationship with Marxist ideology. First emerging in 1920, in the fires of the Indian independence movement, it has grown into a major force on the sub-continent’s political scene. While all of its proponents adhere to the ultimate goal of building a utopian classless society, they have not always agreed on the most desirable method of achieving it. Nevertheless, whether motivating an underground subversive element or an aboveground, election-contesting political party, the basic ideology has proven remarkably resilient in the Indian context. Any examination of the birth of the Naxalite movement in the latter half of the 1960s requires an understanding of its development within this larger phenomenon. Jawaid Sohail, an Indian academic studying the origins of the Naxalites, divides the evolution of the Indian communist movement into six broad periods.26 From its birth until 1941, the Communist Party of India (CPI) suffered from poor organization and leadership. Outlawed by the British colonial authorities, it languished in relative obscurity. However, when Great Britain formed an alliance with the Soviet Union following the outbreak of World War II, the communists enjoyed a new legitimacy, 26 Jawaid, 4. 12 which they exploited by allying themselves with the popular Indian National Congress from 1941-1945. After World War II, this alliance foundered on the emerging international split between East and West, and the CPI moved into opposition against the growing power of Congress in New Delhi. Around the time of India’s independence in 1947, a struggle erupted between the peasants and their ruler in the princely state of Hyderabad, which was vacillating on accession to the Indian union. Inspired by the contemporaneous example of Mao’s “People’s Revolution” in China (and encouraged by its ideological benefactor, the Soviet Union), the CPI embarked on the fourth phase of its activity, supporting an armed agrarian uprising against feudal oppression in Hyderabad that became known as the Telangana movement. In 1948, when the Indian armed forces moved in to forcibly annex the Hyderabad principality, the Telangana insurgents turned against New Delhi. While this initial struggle achieved some degree of early success, temporarily “liberating” more than 3,000 villages and 16,000 square miles of territory, a confluence of events resulted in its ultimate demise. The strength of the Indian armed forces eventually proved overpowering, and a large number of the rebels were killed. Additionally, in an attempt to curry favor with India, the Soviet Union (which had encouraged the uprising in its earlier days) summarily withdrew its support. Taking the hint, the CPI dutifully followed suit in 1951.27 The failure of Telangana inaugurated the fifth period of communist activity, when the CPI, again at Soviet urging, sought to contest national and state elections in a bid to bring about the peaceful imposition of communist rule through democratic conduct. For many of the CPI’s more radical cadres, however, this decision was viewed as a betrayal of the Party’s revolutionary heritage. The memories of Telangana loomed large in their ideological imaginings and a sizeable faction of the CPI began to drift toward a more Maoist interpretation of Marxism-Leninism as the 1950s progressed.28 27 Ajay Mehra, “Naxalism in India: Revolution or Terror?” Terrorism and Political Violence 12, no. 2 (2000): 40-42. 28 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 20-22. 13 This rise of factionalism within the CPI defines the last of Sohail’s six phases and would reach its zenith in the 1960s. With the growing Sino-Soviet split from 1958-1964, the ideological tensions within the CPI continued to mount. These were only exacerbated by the emerging Sino-Indian border dispute in the early 1960s, in which the CPI leadership came down firmly on the side of New Delhi. The pro-Chinese leftists within the party branded this policy as revisionism of the worst sort, and attempted to wrest control from the pro-Soviet faction. Unable to muster sufficient support, they instead broke away from the CPI in 1964 to form the Communist Party of India-Marxist, or CPI- (M).29 However, the CPI-(M) was almost immediately beset by the same kind of ideological infighting that had precipitated its formation. The relatively more restrained group that formed the party’s leadership, though still hostile to the Soviet Union, grudgingly embraced electoral politics as a means of bringing about a more or less peaceful revolution in India. Consequently, when the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War broke out, it quickly condemned Pakistan and its Chinese patron in an effort to capitalize on the wave of nationalist sentiment sweeping India. This tactic proved remarkably successful, and CPI-(M) candidates enjoyed surprising success in the 1967 elections in West Bengal, firmly entrenching the new party within the Indian political process. This proved to be too much for the more radical Maoist faction, and it was within this contentious milieu that the Naxalite movement was born.30 There were now three major communist strands within India: the CPI, the CPI- (M), and the violently radical Maoists. This last group, eventually named for the birthplace of their armed struggle in Naxalbari, West Bengal, would in due course form a third, underground organization, the Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist, or CPI- (ML). Unlike its progenitors, the CPI-(ML) was totally opposed to the electoral process and espoused violent revolution as the only legitimate means of realizing its political agenda. In short, this entailed nothing less than the complete overthrow of the existing 29 Dipak K. Gupta, “The Naxalites and the Maoist Movement in India: Birth, Demise, and Reincarnation,” Democracy and Security 3, no. 2 (May 2007): 166. 30 Jawaid, 76-78. 14 political structure, corrupted as it was by the four evils of “U.S. imperialism, Soviet social-imperialism, feudalism, and comprador-bureaucrat capital.”31 From 1967-1972, this group embarked on a campaign of political terror that caused no small amount of consternation to national and state governments, and resonated, at least initially, with many poor residents of West Bengal, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh. To understand why, one must appreciate India’s broader political, economic, and social contexts during this period. B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments The first seventeen years of India’s independence were marked by the political hegemony of the Congress Party, personified in the undisputed leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru.32 Under his charismatic influence, the fissiparous tendencies of India’s many ethnic, linguistic, religious, and social groups were kept in check, and the country emerged as a surprising beacon of political stability in South Asia. His passing in 1964, however, (and the subsequent death of his successor, Lal Bahadur Shastri, after only two years in power) left the Congress Party rudderless, and the leadership that had united India’s various groups under the mantle of nationalism was gone. Over the next few years, the INC embarked on a process of infighting that diminished its iron grip on political power and allowed alternative forces of social mobilization to pose new challenges to its authority.33 From 1966-1972, this drama played out at the national level in the struggle between Indira Gandhi and Morarji Desai for the position of Prime Minister and head of 31 Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist),” May 1970, reprinted in Sankar Ghosh, The Naxalite Movement: A Maoist Experiment, (Calcutta: Firma K. L. Mukhopadhyay, 1974), 190-199. 32 For outstanding one volume histories of India, see: John Keay, India: A History (New York: Grove Press: 2000);0 Stanley Wolpert, A New History of India: 7th Edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004). 33 Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952-2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 80, 94-96. 15 Congress. While Mrs. Gandhi emerged at the head of a coalition of Congress factions, the structure proved too unwieldy to contest the 1967 national elections as effectively as it had in the past. Beset by a number of economic and social crises (discussed below), Congress suffered its worst electoral performance in history, winning only 40% of the popular vote and barely hanging on to majority in a parliament it had previously dominated.34 With its attention again focused inwardly, factional battles quickly resumed. Following another disappointing performance in the mid-term elections of 1969, the party officially split into two competing camps: Congress (O) under Morarji Desai, and Congress (R) under Indira {later Congress (I)}.35 Though she still commanded a plurality in parliament, Mrs. Gandhi now had to rely on a coalition of leftist parties to give her a working majority, a fact that complicated her ability to respond forcefully to the growing Naxalite movement. The decline in Congress hegemony at the center was mirrored by its performance in the state elections of 1967. From a position of complete dominance in nearly all the state legislatures, the party won only 1,661 of a total 3,453 contested seats.36 Moreover, for the first time, non-Congress led coalition governments came to power in a number of states. These included West Bengal and Orissa, both of which would shortly be affected by the growing Naxalite movement. Notably, the United Democratic Front (UDF) government that formed in West Bengal contained a large and influential bloc of CPI-(M) legislators, a fact that proved important on a number of counts. As previously mentioned, the party’s successful embrace of electoral politics served to further radicalize the already restive militant faction within the CPI-(M). Additionally, while the moderate members of the CPI-(M) and the Naxalites did become bitter enemies, as we shall see, the legacy of their earlier cooperation and shared ideology would greatly complicate the state government’s efforts to effectively counter their activities. The structural shifts underway on India’s political scene thus served to facilitate the emergence and spread of Naxalism in a number of ways. The temporary decline of 34 Wolpert, 382-383. 35 Ibid., 385. 36 Ibid., 383. 16 legitimacy at the center created greater instability that allowed alternative ideologies to take root, while the rise to power of a number of leftist parties (including the Communists) provided breathing room for their more extreme ideological brethren. Concurrently, the new requirements of coalition building diverted politicians’ attention from the essential task of ensuring security in their constituencies.37 To these must be added one more consideration: the fractious nature of political activity undoubtedly complicated the policymaking process at a time when the country faced a range of serious economic problems. While these did not necessarily arise as a result of the political turmoil, the ability of the system to effectively address them was certainly curtailed. 2. Economic Developments In spite of a series of Soviet-inspired Five Year Plans from 1951-1966, India remained a predominantly rural, agrarian economy. Burdened by generally inefficient and backward agricultural methods, it was extremely prone to underproduction and food shortages, a situation exacerbated by the country’s rapidly expanding population. The lack of proper irrigation and over-dependence on the seasonal monsoon rains caused widespread famine in 1952-53, and severe (if localized) food shortages in Bihar and West Bengal from 1965 to 1967.38 Perennially reliant on foreign food aid, particularly from the United States, Indira’s government was forced to seek even greater assistance from America in 1966, which she received in the form of increased wheat shipments and over $400 million U.S. for the implementation of India’s fourth Five-Year Plan.39 The focus of this plan was, in the words of Mrs. Gandhi, to “lay the foundation for a breakthrough in agriculture in the countryside,” primarily through state subsidization for a host of agrarian technology reforms that came to be known as the Green Revolution. Indeed, the combination of expanded irrigation networks, increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, and the utilization of higher-yielding crop varietals that had become available in 1965 did improve the food situation; by the early 1970s, India 37 Rabindra Ray, The Naxalites and their Ideology (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1988), 115. 38 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 212; Wolpert, 362, 380. 39 Wolpert, 380-381. 17 was self-sufficient in grain production for the first time in its history.40 Like most revolutions, however, this one took time to develop and produced a large amount of economic dislocation. Nowhere was this more evident than in West Bengal. These new technologies, while partly government sponsored, still required a fairly significant initial capital outlay to procure and utilize to their fullest advantage. Moreover, they tended to be best employed on relatively large tracts of land so cultivators could reap economies of scale in the new methods of production. As Edward Duyker points out in his study of the predominantly agrarian Santal tribe in West Bengal, this had the effect of economically favoring large landholders over smaller farmers, widening what were already significant income disparities between the two.41 In a system that had its roots in the Zamindars of the British colonial era, most of these smaller farmers were in fact sharecroppers, forced to give up as much as 50% of their harvest in rent to their jotedars, or landlords. To make matters worse, if smaller farmers were to avail themselves of the new technology at all, they often had to take out loans from village moneylenders at exorbitant rates of interest, usually only worsening their economic situation.42 What these long-suffering peasants were most in need of was a comprehensive system of land reform and rural development. Given the strongly socialist leanings of both Nehru and his daughter, the failure of the government to effectively tackle these problems previously was an indication of the power of entrenched vested interests. To be sure, a number of initiatives had been implemented, notably the Community Development and Rural Extension Program under the auspices of the Ford Foundation, the Panchayati Raj program, and a series of land reform laws in the 1950s and 60s.43 Unfortunately, a combination of corruption, cronyism, and loopholes in the legislation prevented any of these measures from having much of an impact on the landless laborers, 40 Keay, 524. 41 Edward Duyker, Tribal Guerrillas: The Santals of West Bengal and the Naxalite Movement (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1987), 55-57; Sumanta Banerjee, India’s Simmering Revolution: The Naxalite Uprising (London: Zed Books Ltd., 1984), 9-12. 42 Jawaid, 40-41; Gupta, 163. 43 Wolpert, 363-364. 18 tribals, and small farmers they were designed to help.44 On the contrary, larger landowners and jotedars were often able to twist the new regulations in their favor, worsening the plight of many of the rural poor, particularly in West Bengal. Nor were economic hardships confined to the countryside. Like most of India, Calcutta had been suffering from economic stagnation for a number of years, and when the Indian government was forced to devalue the rupee in 1966, it had financial repercussions that hit the city hard. The resulting inflation spawned an industrial recession in 1966-67, causing unemployment to increase to dangerous proportions, particularly among the educated youth. While precise figures for this period are unavailable, anecdotal evidence suggests that from one third to one half of all the unemployed were aged 16-24.45 With so much economic frustration in the cities and the countryside, it is not surprising that incidents of social unrest increased as well. 3. Social Developments Given the feudal socio-economic nature of much of its history, peasant uprisings in India were not uncommon. From 1783 to 1900 alone, at the height of the British Raj, over 100 such incidents affected the region to greater or lesser degrees, many of them in the perennially restive province of Bengal.46 As the Telangana uprising in the late 1940s showed, post-independence Indian society was no less susceptible to their occurrence. In retrospect, it appears obvious that many of the factors that had precipitated these events in the past were present in the latter half of the 1960s. As the living situation deteriorated for a substantial number of India’s peasants, strikes and food riots became increasingly frequent in the later 1960s.47 By 1967, many Bengali newspapers carried accounts of impoverished rural citizens driven to suicide by their dire economic straits.48 While the 44 Banerjee, 7-9. 45 Ibid., 32. 46 Mehra, 39. 47 Wolpert, 382. 48 Banerjee, 1. 19 authenticity of all these accounts is difficult to establish, they were emblematic of the desperation and discontent of a large segment of the Indian countryside. The situation in urban society was showing signs of similar strain. Disease, overcrowding, and a lack of adequate infrastructure had long been endemic to most of India’s major cities. Now, as a result of the chronic unemployment discussed in the previous section, increasing numbers of young people were also turning to petty criminality and other anti-social behavior. Known as the “lumpen-proletariat” in Marxist circles, the activities of these idle and angry youth served to further destabilize an already fragile social situation.49 Compounding this tendency was the wave of student radicalism sweeping the world in the latter 1960s. Anti-establishment rhetoric and leftist activism were common on university campuses throughout India, but especially prevalent in Calcutta. In 1965, the Communist faction captured the leadership of the student’s union at the prestigious Presidency College and embarked on a campaign of disobedience, strikes, and protests, many of them violent.50 As clashes between police and urban youths worsened over the ensuing years, Calcutta’s student population grew more radicalized. Watching these developments from their safe houses, the leaders of the Maoist faction in the CPI-(M) grew more confident by the day. The contradictions inherent in India’s “semi-feudal and semi-colonial” society, it seemed to them, were reaching their breaking point, and the situation was ripe for the masses to rise up and finally deliver India from its centuries of capitalist domination. To ignite this potent mixture of urban and rural unrest, all that was needed was a spark. 49 Banerjee, 33. 50 Ibid., 50-52. 20 C. INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NAXALITE INSURGENCY 1. Organization and Leadership Two men in particular laid the groundwork for Naxalism’s emergence in 1967. Kanu Sanyal, a long-time CPI-(M) organizer active among the Santal tribals in Darjeeling, was among those within the party who disagreed strongly with its newly conciliatory leanings toward New Delhi and electoral politics. He discovered an ideological mentor in a passionate but lesser known party functionary, Charu Mazumdar.51 Mazumdar, born to a high caste family in Darjeeling district in 1918, had joined the Communist movement as a young man while attending university, and remained active in the CPI and CPI-(M) for most of his adult life. By the mid-1960s, he had wholeheartedly embraced Maoism as the only valid form of Communist struggle for the Indian situation. Adhering to Mao’s dictum that “political power grows from the barrel of a gun,” Mazumdar utterly rejected electoral politics and sought to apply the lessons of the Chinese revolution, as he saw them, to the struggle in his own country.52 In this, he was greatly influenced by the writings of Lin Biao, the Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and his strategic formulations for guerrilla warfare.53 Mazumdar laid out his theories in a series of essays penned between 1965 and 1967 that served as something of a manifesto for his more radical comrades, particularly in West Bengal.54 In those two years, elements of the CPI-(M) started veering on a more overtly militant course. Under the guidance of Sanyal and Mazumdar, on March 3, 1967, an uprising of poor tribals and peasants erupted in the village of Naxalbari, in the Siliguri sub-division of Darjeeling. While initially confined to the seizure of land and food-grains hoarded by the jotedars, it soon turned violent and began spreading to other villages in Siliguri. By 51 Prakash Singh, The Naxalite Movement in India (New Delhi: Rupa & Co., 2006), 268-274. 52 Jawaid, 55. 53 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 126-127. 54 Biplab Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” Social Scientist 6, no. 12 (July 1978): 8- 10. 21 July 5, the movement had grown large enough to attract the attention of its ideological progenitor, the Communist Party of China (CPC), which, in an editorial in Beijing’s People’s Daily, lauded it as “a peal of spring thunder [that] has crashed over the land of India,” and “a development of tremendous significance for the Indian people’s revolutionary struggle.”55 In reality, the rebellion was not quite that momentous at this stage, as the ease with which it was put down by the West Bengal government would attest. In late July, increased police action and a near total lack of coordination within the movement began to take their toll, and the initial uprising disintegrated by September.56 Nevertheless, the fire had been lit. Mazumdar emerged as a revolutionary leader and his ideology attracted an increasing number of adherents. Now known as Naxalites, militant groups inspired by Mazumdar’s theories began appearing throughout India. Emboldened by China’s rhetorical support, Mazumdar and these like-minded radicals officially broke from the CPI-(M). In November 1967, the All India Coordination Committee of Revolutionaries (AICCR, later renamed the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries, AICCCR) was formed in an attempt to gather the various strands of Naxalism under the banner of one revolutionary party.57 Though largely successful, the deliberations in this body revealed a number of ideological differences among the groups that would prove extremely divisive in a few years. In two cases, that of the Andhra faction of the AICCCR led by Nagi Reddy and another group known as Dakshin Desh, the differences proved insurmountable at an early stage, resulting in their exclusion from the nascent organization. Nevertheless, in April 1969, the formation of the CPI-(ML), with Mazumdar at the head, was announced in Calcutta and quickly endorsed by the CPC.58 It had an estimated 17,000 members at its founding, the majority in Andhra 55 People’s Daily, “ Spring Thunder Breaks Over India,” July 5, 1967, reprinted in Prakash Singh, 259-264. While China did offer significant rhetorical support to the Naxalite movement early on, particularly through editorials in the People’s Daily and broadcasts on the government controlled Xinhua News Agency, there is little evidence of any more concrete assistance. . 56 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 12. 57 Ibid., 31. 58 Ibid., 33. 22 Pradesh and West Bengal.59 For the next three years, the CPI-(ML) would be the dominant face of Naxalism in India. With the pronouncement that the “Chinese Chairman is our Chairman, the Chinese path is our path,” Mazumdar’s agenda for the Naxalites was codified at the First Party Congress in May 1970. It explicitly called for a Maoist inspired violent overthrow of the Indian government by establishing liberated bases in the countryside, surrounding the cities, and eventually subsuming all of India within its “people’s democratic revolution.”60 While Mazumdar’s heady optimism may be understandable in the international political context of the late 1960s, the techniques he advocated for accomplishing these objectives were questionable, to say the least. 2. Strategy and Tactics Mazumdar’s strategy was predicated on the assumption that the contradiction between feudalism and the masses of India’s rural poor had reached the breaking point.61 In his estimation, the situation was ripe for a spontaneous uprising of the beleaguered peasants that would sweep the old political order from the scene in a few short years. In a 1968 article in Liberation, the Naxalites’ primary propaganda mouthpiece, Mazumdar opined that the People’s Liberation Army would be marching through the countryside “by the beginning of 1971, if not in 1970.”62 This outlook informed his strategic formulations in a number of ways. The first was an emphasis on the rural peasants as the true base of the revolution.63 The focus of revolutionary activity was squarely on the countryside, with urban agitation initially prohibited. However, with the majority of the rural population illiterate, Mazumdar was forced to rely on educated ideologues to form the ground level leadership of his organization. To this end, he encouraged the recruitment and 59 Rabindra Ray, 108. 60 “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist),” May 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 199; Jawaid, 36. 61 Ibid.,194. 62 Charu Mazumdar, writing in Liberation, Nov 1968, as reported in Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 62. 63 “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist,” May 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 194. 23 participation of educated urban youth, but demanded they leave the cities and adopt the ways of the local villagers to better indoctrinate and lead them in their revolutionary struggle.64 While a large number of radicalized college students (especially from Calcutta) heeded this call, their insinuation into rural society was highly problematic. Most were quite incapable of adapting to village life, and their different customs engendered suspicion from the more parochial tribals and farmers.65 As a result, while peasants were often capable of being motivated for local actions, they generally failed to adopt Naxalism’s broader ideology.66 As Dipak Gupta notes, the vast majority of activist cadres were educated and from upper caste Hindu families, with poor, illiterate peasants accounting for less than 20% of the committed membership.67 One reason for this apathy among the peasants may have been the Naxalites’ renunciation of mass movements, the second pillar of Mazumdar’s strategy. In his estimation, since the country was on the verge of a spontaneous revolution, it needed no organizing force to guide it. Indeed, mass organizations could only hurt the movement, as they would give the enemy a focus for retaliation.68 While the formation of the CPI- (ML) may seem to contradict this outlook, in reality, the party functioned more symbolically than as a classical political or military organization. While Mazumdar’s ideology did reign supreme, operational control was actually quite decentralized, with village and district level organizations enjoying almost complete autonomy. This situation utterly precluded the development of any sort of broader economic or social agenda that might have been useful in attracting greater peasant support. In fact, Mazumdar believed that attention devoted to social or economic programs could only detract from the primary goal of seizing political power from the state, and actively discouraged their formulation.69 64 Ghosh, 109. 65 Gupta, 173-174; Jawaid, 95. 66 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 57-59. 67 Gupta, 171. 68 Ghosh, 101. 69 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 58-59. 24 Rather than offering hope, Mazumdar contended that the way to inspire India’s poor was to offer the opportunity for revenge. This accounted for the third pillar of his overall strategy, which he dubbed the “annihilation of class enemies.”70 As the name suggests, this entailed the deliberately brutal murder of jotedars, moneylenders, and agents of the government in an effort to spread “red terror” throughout the countryside.71 With the injunction that “he who has not dipped his hand in the blood of class enemies can hardly be called a communist,” the implementation of this campaign became the primary goal of Naxalite cadres throughout India.72 While it did succeed in driving off the landowning elite in some of the affected areas, the sadistic nature of the killings eventually alienated many more of the peasants than it inspired.73 The tactics that Mazumdar prescribed for the execution of the annihilation strategy were similarly self-defeating. Believing that an obsession with the acquisition of firearms would only distract the peasants from their spontaneous revolutionary zeal, he initially forbade their use by any but the party’s leadership, and even these he limited to purposes of self-defense. In the application of the terror campaign, the cadres were only permitted to use traditional weapons like spears, sickles, and bows and arrows. His emphasis on decentralization also stressed the primacy of village level squads, usually of no more than seven members, at the expense of larger formations of fighters.74 Though he later paid lip service to the need for organizing a ‘People’s Liberation Army’ along more conventional lines, there was never any serious attempt to form such a force.75 These tactical decisions left the Naxalites at a decided disadvantage against the comparatively well armed and organized government security forces that eventually moved in to counter them. 70 Charu Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” Liberation, February 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 290-297. 71 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 45-46. 72 Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” reprinted in Ghosh, 294. 73 Dasgupta. The Naxalite Movement, 58, 64. 74 Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” reprinted in Ghosh, 291. 75 Banerjee, 204-206. 25 For all their operational errors, however, a temporarily accommodating political climate allowed the Naxalites to embark on a series of campaigns that caused no small amount of instability in the regions they affected. From the formation of the party in 1969 until July of 1971, they were a force to be reckoned with in a number of Indian states. 3. Naxalite Activity While Naxalite activity and violence in this period were reported from as far afield as Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, the Punjab, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, the bulk remained confined to West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.76 It was in these two states that the annihilation program was most effectively implemented and where the Naxalites had their greatest political impact. Perhaps surprisingly, the first large-scale campaign after Naxalbari came not in West Bengal, but in Srikakulum district of Andhra Pradesh. Srikakulum’s history of peasant unrest predated the Naxalites, emerging as early as 1961 in the form of agitation by the native Girijan tribals against the economic oppression of the landholding class. While this was usually relatively peaceful, the example and influence of Naxalbari soon turned it violent. By late 1968, under the leadership of a number of imported Naxalite cadres, the Girijans were becoming increasingly militant. In 1969, they embarked on a classic annihilation campaign for political control, killing more than 150 people and eventually extending their writ over more than 500 square miles. While Mazumdar’s hopes were high for this “liberated area,” the movement proved more fragile than it appeared. Coordinated action by the security forces resulted in the deaths or arrests of top Naxalite leaders in the district, and Girijan support for the insurgency dissipated by mid-1970.77 In late 1969, the Naxalites launched another offensive in the Midnapur district of West Bengal. Like Srikakulum, it was a classic annihilation campaign with exclusively 76 Singh, 45-81. 77 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 46-52. 26 political aims. In Midnapur, however, the leadership that instigated the rebellion was not composed of older party cadres, but young students from Calcutta.78 Led by Ashit Chatterjee and Santosh Rana, the movement achieved some early success, accounting for the deaths of around 100 ‘class enemies’ and considerable economic disruption. Like Srikakulum, however, the uprising proved unsustainable and collapsed in the face of pressure from the security forces in early 1970.79 Birbhum in West Bengal, Muzzafarpur in Bihar, and the Palia district of Uttar Pradesh also witnessed organized Naxalite activity in 1969-1970. Like all the other rural uprisings, however, their early intensity masked fundamental weaknesses, and they died out almost as dramatically as they had flared up.80 Ironically, Naxalism’s last major campaign in this period occurred not in the countryside, but in Calcutta. Perhaps in desperation at the failures of its rural campaigns, the CPI-(ML) made an abrupt strategic reversal and launched a “cultural revolution” in West Bengal’s teeming capital in April 1970.81 While some observers have described this surprising development as a spontaneous movement by the urban Naxalite cadres, it is clear that Mazumdar himself guided the emergence of this new front at an early stage. Initially, the focus of the movement was on the destruction of symbols of bourgeoisie culture. These included cinemas, universities, and statues of iconic Indian figures like Mahatma Gandhi. Within a few months, however, the annihilation campaign appeared in Calcutta. Initially targeting police officers, its focus soon shifted to CPI-(M) politicians and activists, and even middle-class businessmen.82 The fact that Naxalite violence had now arrived in a major city occasioned great alarm throughout the country, not least in New Delhi. As the insurgency grew more violent through 1970 and early 1971, however, it became apparent that it was losing its ideological focus. In large part, this was due to a dramatic shift in the makeup of the party’s membership. While upper class university 78 Ghosh, 78-79; Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 57. 79 Singh, 63. 80 Ibid., 64-74. 81 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 68-77. 82 Ibid., 79-91. 27 students had been an important component of the early Naxalite movement, by 1970, most had either been arrested or dropped out in revulsion at the excesses of the annihilation campaign. In their place, shiftless youth, petty criminals, and other anti\u0002social elements had risen to prominence in the urban faction of the CPI-(ML). Under the guise of class struggle, extortion, theft, and personally motivated murders by party cadres grew increasingly common. Unsurprisingly, this did little to endear the Naxalites to the majority of Calcutta society. Already alienated by the statue smashing campaign and other petty vandalism, the public turned decisively against them in 1971.83 As a result of this string of failures, the ideological cracks in the leadership of the CPI-(ML) that had been evident at its founding widened into chasms. Mazumdar was increasingly the target of pointed criticism from other Naxalite leaders on a number of issues.84 Prominent among these were his adoption of the annihilation strategy as the primary form of struggle, his total neglect of the urban proletariat as a target of agitation, and the wisdom of his prohibition of all mass organization - in short, all the tenets of his grand strategy. To make matters worse, he had also lost the rhetorical support of the CPC. In late 1970, the Chinese government sent a message to Mazumdar echoing many of the same criticisms that were emanating from within his own party.85 Shortly thereafter, its radio broadcasts in support of the CPI-(ML) ceased.86 Though still claiming allegiance to Beijing, Mazumdar diverged from the CPC line in 1971 by vocally supporting the uprising in East Pakistan against Yahya Khan’s government. This proved to be the last straw for many other Naxalite leaders, who finally broke ranks with this betrayal of China’s ideological direction.87 With the leadership hopelessly divided, the rural campaign in tatters, and the lumpen-proletariat dominating the urban scene, the 83 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 94-102. 84 Sohail, 45-49. 85 Ghosh, 12-21. 86 Banerjee, 170. 87 Banerjee, 247-248; Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 192-193. 28 Naxalite movement was foundering badly. Nevertheless, it would take concerted action by the central and state governments to definitively put an end to this era of Naxalite activity. D. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 1. Center Responses Initially, the government in New Delhi paid scant attention to the outbreak of violence in Naxalbari. Viewing the situation primarily as a localized law and order problem, it did little more than express its opinion to West Bengal that the situation should be dealt with swiftly.88 To be fair, in spite of the attention it received as a result of the CPC’s endorsement, the early movement was too weak and disorganized to merit much more of a reaction. Even as Naxalism organized and spread through 1968-69, it still failed to elicit much of an official response. As mentioned previously, this was probably due to the distraction provided by the leadership battles and other political machinations that occupied the center during these years. By 1970, however, the situation was beginning to change. The emergence of Naxalite violence in Calcutta, one of India’s largest cities, was too worrisome a development to ignore. On August 11, 1970, Indira Gandhi pronounced that the government would fight the Naxalites with “all the strength at its command.”89 Securing the elections in early 1971 provided a pretext for the deployment of military and paramilitary forces to some of the worst Naxal-affected districts.90 In July 1971, the center launched Operation Steeplechase, a coordinated campaign by the Indian army, the Central Reserve Police Force, and local police across contiguous districts in West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa that were still affected by Naxalite violence. This area encompassed West Bengal’s Midnapur and Birbhum districts, and the cadres still active were largely holdovers from those earlier campaign. While Steeplechase was not a complete success, 88 Ghosh, 37. 89 Singh, 112. 90 Ghosh, xxii. 29 in that a sizeable number of activists escaped the police dragnet, it did achieve some noteworthy results: hundreds of Naxalites were arrested, large caches of weapons were seized, and most importantly, the rural population’s confidence in the strength of the government was restored.91 New Delhi also attempted to undercut the grass-roots appeal of Naxalism by championing a number of rural development and land reform schemes.92 The West Bengal Land Reform Act, passed in January 1970, was one such initiative. It imposed ceilings on the total acreage individual families were allowed to hold and reduced the maximum rent that landlords could charge their sharecroppers. As usual, the law was filled with loopholes, and the ever-present corruption and conflicts of interest severely curtailed its overall efficacy.93 Nevertheless, it did help some of the landless poor and scored political points at the expense of the Naxalites. For all the efforts of the central government, however, Naxal violence remained fundamentally a state problem. India’s Constitution devolved authority over internal security to the states, and it was their policies and initiatives that mattered most.94 Of course, if a state proved incapable of handling its own affairs, there was a constitutional answer for that, too. 2. State Responses In Andhra Pradesh, a determined state government, united under firm Congress Party rule, was able to cope with the violence in Srikakulum on its own. While allegations of police brutality and ‘encounter killings’ were common, the swift and effective application of force by the state police broke the back of the insurgency there in a matter of months.95 The situation in West Bengal was somewhat more complicated. With the CPI-(M) occupying key leadership positions in the United Democratic Front 91 Singh, 99-100. 92 Wolpert 389; Jawaid, 98-100. 93 Jawaid, 86-89. 94 Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Annual Report 2006-07, 1. 95 Ghosh, 84. 30 government, West Bengal’s response to the emergence of Naxalism was initially quite tepid. This was largely due to infighting between the members of the coalition. While other parties argued for a strong response to the initial outbreak of violence in Naxalbari, the CPI-(M) vacillated. Though it wanted to reign in its adventurist cadres in Siliguri, it was fearful of damaging its revolutionary credentials by authorizing too forceful a response. Additionally, the agitators were still members of the CPI-(M) at this stage, and the party was hopeful of bringing them back into its fold. As a result, police actions in response to the increasing violence through July 1967 were quite circumscribed.96 By the time a deteriorating situation forced the government’s hand in August and September, the movement had already attracted a sizeable following. While the insurrection in Naxalbari was effectively put down in a relatively short period of time, the damage had been done. Though the inability of the UDF to effectively govern forced its dissolution in November 1967, mid-term elections returned it to power in February 1969. With broadly the same makeup, it proved even less capable of agreement in policymaking, particularly with respect to the Naxalites. Not only did the government fail to outlaw the movement, some of its constituent parties actually sought to curry favor with the Maoists in a bid to strengthen their popularity with rural voters.97 Again, this resulted in a generally weak security response, with the police budget actually reduced just as the activity in Midnapur and Calcutta was beginning to heat up.98 With the coalition hopelessly polarized and the security situation deteriorating, New Delhi imposed President’s Rule on West Bengal in March 1970. President’s Rule, an administrative device under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, allows the center to assume executive authority in a state if the ruling government can no longer form a majority in the state legislature.99 With the governor 96 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 9. 97 Jawaid, 96-97. 98 Ibid., 73. 99 Government of India, Constitution of India, Ministry of Laws and Justice, http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/welcome.html (accessed December 11, 2007). 31 (as an agent of New Delhi) now firmly in charge, the security situation began to improve rapidly. The 1932 Bengal Suppression of Terrorist Outrage Act was quickly revived, giving the police expanded powers of detention.100 Funding for the state police forces more than doubled, and the number of officers rose dramatically.101 Augmented by personnel from the center’s Border Security Force, these additional men were posted to hotbeds of Naxalite activity, especially Siliguri, Midnapur, and Calcutta. In April, a joint operation by the Indian military and the Central Reserve Police Force, in coordination with state police, successfully put down the Midnapur uprising in a matter of weeks.102 Though it took a while longer, the expanded presence in Calcutta also proved effective. Aided by government sponsored volunteer militias, ironically drawn from the same lumpen-proletariat element the Naxalites had utilized, forceful policing resulted in the deaths or arrest of thousands of Naxalite cadres and sympathizers.103 As in Andhra Pradesh, abuses by the anti-Naxal forces were not uncommon – in one notorious instance, 300 armed members of a volunteer militia rampaged through a Naxalite stronghold in the Cossipore-Baranagore neighborhood of Calcutta, killing nearly 100 suspected Naxalites in cold blood.104 Though brutal, the tactics were effective. By the end of 1971, Mazumdar was forced to officially abandon the urban campaign in the face of mounting losses.105 The movement was by this time a spent force, and its fortunes continued to decline as top leadership was caught up in the tightening police dragnet through the first half of 1972. Finally, on July 16, 1972, Charu Mazumdar himself was arrested from a safe house in the Calcutta suburb of Entally. On July 28, he died in police custody at the age of 54. The death of Mazumdar was a fittingly symbolic denouement to the movement that had burned so brightly for over five years. With the departure of its spiritual and ideological leader, the first phase of Naxalite activity in India was over. 100 Jawaid, 83-84. 101 Ibid., 85. 102 Gupta, 171. 103 Jawaid, 84. 104 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 92. 105 Banerjee, 213. 32 E. CONCLUSION This chapter has analyzed the birth, rise, and eventual decline of the Naxalite insurgency from 1967-1972. The emergence of Naxalism in 1967 was ultimately attributable to a number of factors. Persistent poverty and growing inequality in the countryside produced a groundswell of discontentment in the poor rural population. Deeply frustrated with their government, some peasants and tribals were willing to entertain any alternative ideology that promised empowerment and greater equity; though it was certainly the most violent, Naxalism was just one of a number of socio-political movements that began to emerge at this time.106 Concurrently, political instability brought by the initial weakening of the INC’s hegemony provided room for these alternative ideologies to grow. Finally, leftist revolutionary rhetoric was ubiquitous in the late 1960s, both domestically and internationally. This provided a veneer of ideological sophistication to a movement that offered little more than violence, and allowed it to challenge the state’s legitimacy, at least for a while. However, while the Naxalite movement during this period drew much attention from the press and occasioned a great deal of worry in New Delhi and elsewhere, it seems clear in hindsight that the danger was not as great as many feared at the time. Although Naxalism touched almost every part of the country from 1967-1972, its activities were widely dispersed, and it never controlled more than 200 of India’s 56,000 rural villages at any one time.107 As militant Communism blossomed throughout much of the third world in the late 1960s, it may seem surprising that it failed to gain more traction in the Indian context, beset as it was by many of the same socio-economic problems evident in Southeast Asia or Latin America. In the final analysis, much of the responsibility for the ultimate failure of the Naxalite movement in this period must be laid at the feet of Charu Mazumdar. 106 Some others included movements based on language, caste, and even the rural-urban divide. For a discussion of these phenomena, see: Yadav and Palshikar, 92-96. 107 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 62. 33 The man regarded as ‘India’s Mao Zedong\" proved to be a much less competent leader than his Chinese namesake. Ideologically, his blind application of the Chinese revolutionary model to India overlooked fundamental differences between the two countries. India’s governmental apparatus was much more powerful than its Chinese counterpart had been in the late 1940s. The institution of parliamentary democracy had become well entrenched in India, and it would take more than temporary economic hardships to undermine its widespread support. Additionally, despite its faltering in the elections of 1967, the Congress Party proved to be enduringly popular. The INC was granted an impressive mandate in the 1971 and 1972 elections at both the state and national levels, demonstrating that it retained the support of a majority of the Indian population.108 Therefore, while Mazumdar correctly identified the rising levels of discontent in Indian society, he totally misread the resultant potential for a rapid revolution. The majority of India’s peasants were concerned with local social and economic issues, and remained unmoved by Naxalite political ideology. As it turned out, most of Mazumdar’s strategic and operational initiatives actually proved counterproductive in winning over India’s masses. His single-minded focus on the seizure of political power and utter contempt for mass organization precluded the development of any socio-economic agenda that might have been useful in garnering broad rural support. While this was supposed to be achieved through the application of the annihilation campaign, the brutality of this program actually alienated the majority of peasants. When it was extended to urban areas during the Calcutta campaign, it had the same effect on most city residents; the ill-conceived “cultural revolution” and the excesses of the lumpen-proletariat faction only exacerbated this revulsion. In the end, Mazumdar’s strategic choices effectively denied his movement any base of popular support. Nor did he better acquit himself in his tactical formulations. The curious prohibition on firearms left his cadres woefully outgunned by the military and police. Additionally, his penchant for decentralization severely restricted the Naxalites’ ability to 108 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 229-231; Wolpert, 389. 34 adapt to changing military circumstances. Even as the scale of the government’s security operations grew from 1967-1972, the Maoists continued to emphasize small, village-level units at the expense of a more sizeable and coherent military organization. Time and again, these proved incapable of mounting an effective resistance to the larger, better equipped, and more highly organized forces arrayed against them. While Mazumdar’s inept leadership set the stage for the movement’s demise, the overall effectiveness of the government’s response must also be acknowledged. With the exception of the UDF initiatives in West Bengal, robust and forceful responses by state and central security forces were eventually successful in putting down all the uprisings. While these did involve a number of human rights abuses, the growing public disgust with Naxalite violence meant that most Indians seemed to accept these aggressive policing methods.109 Simultaneously, all levels of government increased funding for land reforms and rural development programs in an effort to address the socio-economic inequities that had helped spark the outbreak of violence. While these did not always work as they were intended, they did succeed in winning back the support of the rural poor. The final contributor to the failure of the Naxalite movement in this period was its overall organizational weakness. Mazumdar’s charismatic personality had papered over the movement’s fissiparous tendencies in 1967, but these forces could not be contained for long. Ideological differences and powerful egos erupted again in late 1970, and the leadership had irrevocably fractured by 1972. The CPI-(ML) splintered into a number of different factions, including the Maoist Communist Centre, the Proletarian Party, and a grouping of the CPI-(ML)’s Regional Committees of West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.110 Along with Dakshin Desh and the Nagi Reddy Group, these localized, weakened, and divided organizations would be the diminished face of Naxalism through its next period of activity, 1972-1991. 109 Gupta, 173 110 Jawaid, 94. 35 III. THE FRAGMENTARY PERIOD (1972-1991) A. INTRODUCTION In 1972, the Naxalites emerged from the failures and setbacks at the end of the Organizational Period in a critically weakened state: their founder and most influential leader, Charu Mazumdar, was dead; their surviving leadership was rotting in jail after a brutally effective government crackdown; their activists were disillusioned and demoralized after a succession of defeats; and the excesses of revolutionary zeal had alienated them from the vast majority of the Indian public. Given this litany of woes, most observers could be forgiven for assuming that the movement was as good as dead. As it turned out, the flame ignited at Naxalbari had not extinguished – it was, however, reduced to a smoldering ember that was very nearly snuffed out over the course of the next two decades.111 The years from 1972-1991 unquestionably marked the nadir of the Naxalite movement in India. Battered by the government’s security forces in the previous period, it desperately needed to reunify and consolidate its position. Instead, it was repeatedly fragmented by disagreements over ideological abstractions, strategic formulations, and even personal egos. The result was a proliferation of small, localized groups that proved utterly incapable of mounting any effective challenge to the Indian government. In short, the story of the Naxalites in this period is a rather boring one compared to the events of 1965-1972. It is, nonetheless, one worth examining. For the purposes of analyzing Naxalism’s resurgence after 1991, this period is important on three counts. First, it acted as a bridge between the two periods of relatively high Naxalite activity. Secondly, it gave rise to the factions that turned into the dominant Naxalite groups of the current era; clearly, any study of these organizations must take into account the circumstances of their birth. Lastly, determining the reasons for the movement’s inability to gain traction in the past should help in prescribing effective ways to counter its spread in future. 111 This analogy is borrowed, with appreciation, from Prakash Singh’s The Naxalite Movement in India. 36 B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments The 1970s and 80s were a transitional period in Indian politics. The instability of 1965-1971, discussed in the preceding chapter, was the first indication that the institution of one-party hegemony known as the ‘Congress System’ was not as unshakeable as it had previously appeared.112 Though Indira’s party enjoyed landslide victories at the state and national levels in 1971 and 1972, successfully consolidating the INC and the country under the banner of her leadership, this apparent return to the stability of the old ‘Congress system’ belied a number of emerging structural changes in the Indian polity. Chief among these were the increasing politicization of lower and middle classes and castes, the rising importance of local-level issues, and the resultant emergence of regional and state level parties. While these processes evolved gradually, they set the stage for the tremendous changes that would occur on the Indian political scene in the 1990s, and helped make politics in these two decades more complex than it had been in the past. Though a thorough examination of these phenomena is outside the scope of this thesis, they indirectly impacted the course of Naxalism in a number of ways.113 One was through political developments in New Delhi. As previously alluded, Congress (I) emerged in 1972 with firm control of the national government. In light of the changing political scene, the party was remarkably effective in maintaining its grip on power for the remainder of this period, only relinquishing it during two brief interludes of Janata Party-led coalition government, in 1977-1980 and 1989-1991. In retrospect, this success was largely due to Indira’s political guile and capacity for heavy-handed authoritarianism. Recognizing that anti-colonial nationalism was no longer an effective rallying cry for the masses, she sought to mobilize support by turning to a more populist 112 Rajni Kothari, “The Congress ‘System’ in India,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 58-70. 113 For an excellent examination of structural changes in Indian politics during this period, see: Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952- 2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 73-113. 37 message.114 Though Congress remained the party of India’s industrial classes, it also began to reemphasize its socialist roots. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, agricultural development, poverty reduction, and economic self-sufficiency featured prominently in Congress’ platform, successfully attracting significant portions of the lower classes and castes.115 This shift in message did more than win elections – it also boosted the government’s legitimacy with India’s poor, thereby undercutting the appeal of alternative ideologies like Naxalism. When rhetoric proved insufficient in maintaining Congress hegemony, however, the party was not averse to taking more extreme measures. The imposition of the ‘Emergency’ from June 1975 to March 1977 demonstrated this most strikingly. Faced with declining popularity and a series of legal challenges to her rule, Mrs. Gandhi temporarily abrogated the constitution, suspended all civil rights, jailed opposition political figures, and instituted martial law throughout the country.116 Though democracy and the rule of law were reinstated with the national elections in 1977, Indira, and the Congress Party more generally, showed themselves more than willing to deal harshly with political opposition. As we will see, this resulted in a usually muscular response to separatist movements and other insurrections, including those of the Naxalite groups. Developments at the state level were also important. Throughout the early 1970s and the period of the Emergency, Congress governments retained power in the vast majority of the Indian states. However, after the INC’s temporary defeat at the center in 1977, the number and influence of state-level parties accelerated dramatically. Significantly, this phenomenon began in those areas most affected by Naxalism during the previous period, with the emergence of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh and the resurgence of the CPI-(M) in West Bengal.117 The growth of these parties, many of which depended on tenant farmers and landless laborers for their 114 Yadav and Palshikar, 96. 115 Wolpert, 389-410. 116 Ibid., 398-399. 117 Yadav and Palshikar, 106-112. 38 primary constituencies, gave a new political voice to groups that had been effectively disenfranchised in the past. Their inclusion in the political process helped keep rural unrest in check and brought an added impetus for meaningful action on economic issues that were dear to this large demographic. 2. Economic Developments India’s economy during this period was something of a mixed bag. At the macro level, Congress’ socialist policies, the persistence of an overbearing public sector epitomized by the ‘License Raj’ and a strategy of import-substitution industrialization introduced significant distortions in the economy that stifled growth the country so desperately needed. While overall GDP increased at an average of 3.5 percent throughout the 1970s, an exploding population meant the corresponding rate per capita was only 1.3 percent, far below that of the rest of the developing world. Though tepid attempts at liberalization resulted in slightly higher growth rates in the 1980s, their incomplete nature resulted in a balance of payments crisis that ultimately proved unsustainable and precipitated the economic reforms of the 1990s.118 On the other hand, the benefits of the Green Revolution were finally becoming more evenly distributed, and Congress’ newfound political populism translated into a slew of rural and agricultural development initiatives and aid programs.119 For the country’s poor farmers at least, the picture was finally becoming a bit brighter. Indira’s initial reforms after the 1971 elections were ambitious in scope and included land-reform legislation, rural employment programs, nationalization of food markets, and investment in transportation infrastructure designed to help farmers get their product to market. These were consolidated in the country’s Fifth Five Year Plan, launched in 1974, the explicit aims of which were the “removal of poverty” and the “attainment of economic self-reliance.” For all its optimism, the plan’s designs were complicated by the same corruption and conflicts of interest that had plagued reform efforts in previous eras. Additionally, the worldwide oil shocks of the early 1970s 118 Gurcharan Das, “The India Model,” Foreign Affairs 85, no. 4 (July/August 2006): 4-5. 119 Wolpert, 387-388; Jawaid, 100-102. 39 brought massive inflation that substantially diminished economic growth in real terms. Bihar and Gujarat erupted in riots and protests at the diminishing economic situation, and a national railroad strike threatened to bring the country to a standstill and compound its economic problems.120 Though political factors contributed more directly to the imposition of the Emergency in 1975, Indira used her newfound power to tackle the economic challenges facing the country. Her ‘Twenty-Point Program’ of economic development was very similar to the country’s Fifth Five Year Plan, but with political opposition sidelined, Mrs. Gandhi was able to force its implementation more effectively.121 For all its authoritarianism, the Program was remarkably successful in getting the economic situation under control and finally bringing some relief to farmers and the rural poor. Inflation was successfully tamed, food prices retreated to their 1971 levels, and agricultural investment and subsidies began reaching the people that truly needed them.122 When the Emergency was repealed and the Janata government came to power in 1977, the coalition proved so weak and the government so ineffectual that economic problems returned almost immediately. Inflation and unemployment skyrocketed, and Congress returned to power in 1980 with the slogan “Elect a Government that Works!”123 Though she initially tried to cut agricultural subsidies, the political backlash convinced Indira and her party that the rural interests would still have to be placated. The Sixth Five Year Plan brought numerous anti-poverty initiatives like the Integrated Rural Development Program and the National Rural Employment Program, and inaugurated huge agricultural subsidies that continued throughout the 1980s.124 In sum, while overall economic performance throughout this period was relatively mediocre, the numerous development initiatives meant the plight of the rural poor ceased to deteriorate as it had 120 Wolpert, 396-397. 121 Ibid., 400. 122 Ibid., 403. 123 Ibid., 407-410. 124 Banerjee, 293. 40 from 1965-1972. In fact, the rural poverty rate declined relatively dramatically over this period, from 56% in 1973 to only 39% by 1988.125 This is not to imply that these programs were unqualified successes; corruption and conflicts of interest continued to hamper their implementation, and their benefits were far from uniformly distributed. Nevertheless, they were successful enough to alleviate some of the income disparities that had stoked the fires of Naxalism in the previous period, and diminished economic and class issues as a source of social unrest.126 3. Social Developments Despite the attenuation of economic inequity as a source of social strife, the 1970s and ‘80s witnessed the birth of new ethnic and religious cleavages in India’s heterogeneous society, precipitating the rise of a number of new communal and secessionist movements. Though none of these were directly connected to the phenomenon of Naxalism, their emergence and the government’s response did have implications for the Maoists’ fortunes. Two of the most prominent of these movements occurred in the Punjab and India’s wild Northeast. In the late 1970s, a wave of unrest swept India’s ‘Seven Sisters,’ the small and predominantly tribal states east of the Siliguri corridor. While the trouble started in response to an influx of Bengali refugees in the wake of the 1971 Indo-Pak War, it soon took on a distinctly separatist character.127 Historically, the region had only the loosest association with the rest of the subcontinent and was much more culturally bound to neighboring areas of Burma than to the rest of India. By the early 1980s, the Assamese, Bodo, Naga, and Mizo peoples had launched a series of violent secessionist movements, many of which continue to the present day. In response, New Delhi imposed martial law and dispatched the military and central police forces to put down the rebellions. Rajiv 125 Poverty statistics based on consumption data from India’s National Sample Survey, as reported on: Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, “Central Statistical Organization: Reports and Publications,” http://mospi.gov.in/mospi_cso_rept_pubn.htm (accessed February 28, 2008). 126 Jawaid, 98-100. 127 Wolpert, 411. 41 Gandhi was able to negotiate a temporary suspension of hostilities in the late 1980s, but the arrangements soon fell apart, with the military redeployed to the Northeast in force by 1990.128 On the other side of the country, another, even bloodier secessionist movement emerged at roughly the same time. The Sikh community had agitated for a separate Sikh nation, notionally known as Khalistan, since around the time of Partition and Independence in 1947. The movement had been largely peaceful in the intervening decades, but by the late 1970s, it was becoming more belligerent. Under the leadership of J. S. Bhindranwale, a Sikh religious guru, armed members of the separatist Akali Dal Party stormed the Golden Temple at Amritsar in a direct challenge to New Delhi’s authority. In response to the rising violence and lawlessness throughout the Punjab, Indira’s actions were swift and uncompromising. In June of 1984, the Indian Army launched ‘Operation Bluestar,’ retaking the Golden Temple by force and inflicting massive casualties on its Sikh defenders.129 The operation cost Mrs. Gandhi her life (she was shortly thereafter assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards) and did not end the Khalistan movement immediately. It did, however, set the tone for the center’s response through the remainder of the decade.130 Extremely aggressive security actions continued, and ultimately proved successful in putting down the insurrection by the early 1990s. For the Naxalites, the impact of unrest in the Punjab and the Northeast was twofold. First, it seems likely that the threats to the integrity of the nation served to rally significant portions of the electorate to the government, giving New Delhi an added source of legitimacy. Much as the government enjoyed a boost of popularity in 1971-72 during the Indo-Pak war, the actions against the animist tribals and (especially) the Sikhs played well with India’s majority Hindu polity.131 This doubtlessly helped curtail the popularity of an anti-government ideology like Naxalism. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the aggressive response to each of these movements presented a daunting 128 Wolpert, 425-426. 129 Ibid., 416-418. 130 Ibid., 423-425. 131 Ibid., 418. 42 challenge to any other would-be troublemakers. As historian Stanley Wolpert notes, “The stunning, shocking violence of Operation Bluestar served to put every minority in India on immediate notice of just how dangerous continued opposition to Delhi could be.”132 The Naxalites could certainly be included as one of these minority groups. As we shall see, however, the most potent enemy of Naxalism in this period was the internal disarray of the movement itself. C. INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NAXALITE INSURGENCY 1. Organization and Leadership Following the death of Charu Mazumdar in 1972, the Naxalites underwent a process of fragmentation that severely crippled the movement over the ensuing decades. Though their total numbers stayed relatively steady, with most estimates in the neighborhood of 15,000 activists nationwide, the leadership was increasingly driven by ideological and operational differences of opinion.133 While the failures of the previous period were the immediate catalyst for this phenomenon, the movement had displayed factionalist tendencies almost from its inception. At the organizational meetings of the AICCCR in 1969, two groups parted ways with the nascent CPI-(ML) from the outset. The first of these was the Andhra faction of Naxalites under the leadership of Nagi Reddy. Reddy differed with Mazumdar’s formulations on a number of points, most crucially the blanket ban on elections and the single-minded emphasis on the annihilation strategy at the expense of economic struggles and mass organization.134 After being disaffiliated from the AICCCR, Reddy formed his own organization in 1969, the Andhra Pradesh Revolutionary Communist Committee (APRCC). While the APRCC was initially larger than the CPI-(ML), Reddy’s arrest in late 1969 severely curtailed its activities.135 In the 1970s, the APRCC broke up into a 132 Wolpert, 418. 133 New York Times, “Maoist Extremists Reappear in India,” October 12, 1980. 134 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 154-156. 135 Ibid., 34. 43 number of smaller organizations, the two most significant of which were the Unity Center of Communist Revolutionaries of India (UCCRI) led by Nagi Reddy himself and Chandra Pulla Reddy’s Revolutionary Communist Center (RCC).136 While both groups were marginally active in Andhra Pradesh through the 1970s, they underwent numerous splits themselves in the latter half of the decade. By 1990, these smaller groups had either withered to inconsequence or been absorbed by other Naxalite outfits. The other faction that split from the AICCCR in 1969 was known as Dakshin Desh. Its leaders, Amulya Sen and Kanai Chatterjee, also disagreed with Mazumdar over the necessity of mass organization and established their own group, initially based in West Bengal. With the government crackdowns of 1970-71, Dakshin Desh moved its operations to Bihar, changing its name to the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) in 1975.137 Though relatively small, the MCC remained a more or less coherent organization over the course of these two decades. The same could certainly not be said for Charu Mazumdar’s CPI-(ML). The party had always been a relatively fragile construct of disparate personalities and ideologies, but after the setbacks of 1971-1972, it underwent a dizzying process of fractionalization that resulted in the emergence of literally dozens of competing groups. As the smaller organizations were often short-lived and of little real significance in the future development of the movement, only the most important will be enumerated here. Following Mazumdar’s death in 1972, the CPI-(ML) split into two broad camps: those who supported his ideology, strategy, and tactics, and those who opposed them. The pro-Mazumdar camp was further divided in 1973, with Lin Biao’s fall from grace in the Chinese Communist Party. A source of great inspiration for Mazumdar’s ideology, his disavowal by the Chinese generated contentious ideological debate within this branch of Naxalism.138 The pro-Mazumdar/pro-Lin Biao faction, a distinct minority, regrouped in West Bengal under the leadership of Mahadev Mukherjee.139 The pro-Mazumdar/anti- 136 Banerjee, 166, 298. 137 Prakash Singh, 115-116. 138 Banerjee, 246. 139 Ghosh, 175-177. 44 Lin Biao faction emerged in Bihar as CPI-(ML) Liberation, and in Andhra Pradesh as the Central Organizing Committee CPI-(ML), or COC-(ML).140 The COC-(ML) would itself split in 1977, with one faction, led by Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, reestablishing itself in 1980 as CPI-(ML) People’s War Group, or PWG, in Andhra Pradesh.141 Among the anti-Mazumdar camp, the shakeout in this period was somewhat less confusing. The largest group emerged under the leadership of Satyanarayan Singh, the erstwhile Secretary of the CPI-(ML)’s Bihar State Committee. Singh had fallen out with Mazumdar in late 1971 over the latter’s authoritarian tendencies and seemingly suicidal tactical injunctions. In November of that year, Singh and a number of similarly disenchanted leaders formed a parallel leadership and actually expelled Mazumdar from his own party.142 Though most of the Naxalite rank-and-file did not initially accept this, Singh attracted a sizeable following after Mazumdar’s passing. His organization, known as CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh, was the largest and most influential of the post-Mazumdar Naxalite groups in the 1970s.143 The only other sizeable anti-Mazumdar group to emerge was Bihar’s CPI-(ML) Unity Committee, led by Khokan Mazumdar (no relation to Charu). In 1982, this group merged with the Bihar faction of the COC-(ML) to form the CPI-(ML) Party Unity, with Naveen Prasad as its new leader.144 While the proliferation of groups in this period might give an impression of vitality, the splintering of the movement was actually indicative of a great deal of uncertainty and acrimony in the ranks. While all still agreed on the need for a Maoist\u0002inspired political revolution in the country, Mazumdar’s death and the fallout from the failures of the 1965-1972 period had left the Naxalites confused and quarrelsome, on issues both practical and ideological. Cries of ‘revisionism’ by one group were answered with counteraccusations of ‘left-adventurism’ from another. The resultant infighting left 140 Prakash Singh, 156; Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 22. 141 Prakash Singh, 130. 142 Ghosh, 139-144, 151. 143 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 10. 144 Prakash Singh, 159-160. 45 the cadres demoralized and the leadership even more hopelessly divided.145 Perhaps no issue generated more contention than the most appropriate strategy to pursue in the post\u0002Mazumdar era. 2. Strategy and Tactics Following the security crackdowns in 1971-72, most of the Naxalite groups initially continued to advocate a violent strategy. With the memories of government repression fresh in their minds, this was not altogether surprising – most of their leaders continued to languish in prison, often under harsh conditions. Dakshin Desh and the pro\u0002Lin Biao faction in West Bengal were particularly vociferous in their agitation for a continuation of the annihilation policy. The other groups placed more rhetorical emphasis on building up mass organizations, but they too were initially unwilling to forswear armed struggle against the hated oppressors.146 However, with the end of the Emergency and the rise of the first Janata government, a more moderate position began to emerge within a key segment of the Naxalite movement. The CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh was the first major organization to change tack. Negotiating with Janata politicians from his jail cell after the 1977 elections, Singh’s aversion to electoral politics and compromise with the state softened. In a surprise move, he released a press statement in April 1977 expressing his “critical support” for the new Janata government and vowing that his group would participate in the assembly elections of June of that year.147 The formerly staunch advocate of the annihilation strategy went so far as to announce, “We wish to state categorically here that violence is not our ideology. Our ideology is Marxism-Leninism.”148 Though he justified this ideological reversal on the grounds that it would secure the release of political prisoners and enable the Maoists to present their platform to more of the population than ever before, his move 145 Jawaid, 94-95. 146 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 11. 147 Ibid., 14. 148 Prakash Singh, 121-122. 46 was viewed as treason by the rest of the movement.149 However, when the Janata government delivered on its promises of clemency and one of Singh’s candidates was actually elected in West Bengal (Santosh Rana, formerly the leader of the Midnapur uprising), his approach was vindicated in the eyes of many Naxalites. Even such old\u0002school stalwarts as Kanu Sanyal and Ashim Chatterjee eventually gave Singh’s strategy their grudging endorsement.150 Throughout the rest of the 1970s and 80s, CPI-(ML) Liberation and various lesser organizations followed the CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh’s lead and slowly moderated their stance. To be sure, it took time for the incidences of violence to diminish, and many of these groups stressed that they still retained the option of armed revolution.151 Nevertheless, they increasingly normalized their activities, allying themselves with leftist political parties and contesting elections at the state level through front organizations in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal.152 For other groups, however, rapprochement with any government forces, whatever their political stripes, remained anathema. The MCC, COC-(ML), and CPI-(ML) Unity Committee acknowledged the need for a greater emphasis on mass organization, but only in support of armed agrarian revolution.153 The latter two organizations splintered in the late 1970s, but their descendants carried on their two-pronged strategy of mass mobilization and violent opposition in the subsequent decade. Both the PWG and Party Unity continued the killing of jotedars and other class enemies, but not as single-mindedly as the CPI-(ML) had in the past. They also established aboveground organizations to agitate for land reform and minimum wages, and began setting up parallel administrations to dispense justice and other government functions that were lacking in the remote areas where they operated.154 Interestingly, the PWG was also able to attract some support by waging a 149 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 14-15. 150 Prakash Singh, 123. 151 Ibid., 158. 152 Tilak, 19-20; Prakash Singh, 123. 153 Prakash Singh, 123. 154 Ibid., 133-134. 47 campaign against social vice in the villages, which included crusades against drunkenness, gambling, and prostitution.155 Despite their avowed commitment to a similarly multi-pronged approach, the MCC was generally less successful in these secondary endeavors. During the 1980s, the group was best known for the gruesome nature of its continuing annihilations, still directed primarily at upper caste landlords.156 At the tactical level, those groups espousing violence began implementing more realistic methods in their continued pursuit of armed revolution. Discarding the Charuist aversion to modern weaponry, most actively encouraged the capture of guns from jotedars and police.157 While this slowly improved the Naxalites’ firepower, their operations remained dominated by small squad-level actions, and were generally unsophisticated in terms of their planning and execution. In the late 1980s, the PWG did receive some training from LTTE rebels in more advanced tactics, including the use of explosives. This enabled them to successfully carry out a land-mine attack against police forces in 1989, providing a deadly portent of things to come.158 For the most part, however, major improvements in the Maoists’ operational capabilities would not come until well into the next decade. 3. Naxalite Activity As fundamental as it was, the split between those groups that followed the Singh line of political normalization and those that continued with the strategy of violence was just one of a host of divisions that spread like a cancer through the movement. Even groups on the same side of the strategic divide remained pitted against one another over issues of personality or ideology, and fratricide was not uncommon.159 In this contentious environment, there was little hope of consolidation or cooperation. Split as 155 Prakash Singh, 137-138. 156 Ibid., 151-153. 157 Ibid., 136 , 151. 158 Ibid., 140-141. 159 Ibid., 155. 48 they were into numerous smaller groupings, the Naxalites’ activity in this period was generally circumscribed and remained restricted to a few small geographic areas. Throughout the early and mid-1970s, a combination of effective security efforts and the imprisonment of most of the leadership put a stop to almost all violent Naxalite activity. Indeed, brief periods of unrest were recorded in only two places: northern West Bengal and Bhojpur district in Bihar. The agitation in West Bengal erupted in 1973, led by the pro-Mazumdar/pro-Lin Biao faction of Mahadev Mukherjee. For about a year, actions against police forces resulted in several dozen deaths and the seizure of a similar number of firearms, but the uprising fizzled with Mukherjee’s arrest towards the end of 1974.160 The activity in Bhojpur was slightly longer lived, lasting from 1972-1977, and was led by CPI-(ML) Liberation. Still committed to violent revolution at this stage, the group carried out a number of annihilations against class enemies with the support of local tribes. Still, the uprising was a small-scale affair, accounting for only around ninety deaths over the entire five-year period, with its longevity due more to the state government’s anemic response than the actual strength of the insurgency. Like its counterpart in West Bengal, it was put down relatively easily with the introduction of more aggressive security measures, this time from the center.161 The late 1970s witnessed the dramatic announcements of Satyanarayan Singh and the political normalization of a number of Naxalite groups. Though gradual, this proved to be an enduring phenomenon, and the CPI-(ML) S.N.Singh and its followers largely retreated from violent activities. Though still active politically, their strategic course change effectively removed them from the Naxalite fold by the early 1980s, at least for the purposes of this thesis. As for the more recalcitrant Maoists, two dozen smaller groups remained minimally active in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and a number of southern states.162 Between them all, however, they accounted for only a handful of incidents and even fewer deaths. Throughout the 1980s, the only groups of 160 Ghosh, 175-177. 161 Prakash Singh, 117-119. 162 Ibid., 124. 49 any real significance were the PWG in Andhra Pradesh, and what the Indian security official Prakash Singh dubbed the ‘New Left’ in Bihar.163 Formed in April 1980 by Kandapalli Seetharamaiah, the PWG quickly became the most powerful Naxalite organization in the country. Though this latter fact was admittedly not much of a boast during this period, they were a disruptive influence in their primary area of operations, the perennially restive and underdeveloped Telangana region.164 While the group did engage in rudimentary social projects and set up a number of peasant organizations to help mobilize the masses in pursuit of economic goals, Seetharamaiah was also a firm believer in Mazumdar’s annihilation strategy. As Table 1 shows, the group grew increasingly violent under his leadership, with attacks on jotedars, police, and police informants.165 Though still relatively contained by the end of the 1980s, the PWG was already demonstrating the bloody ruthlessness that would distinguish it in later decades. The ‘New Left’ in Bihar emerged at roughly the same time as the PWG. Comprised of the MCC, Party Unity, and CPI-(ML) Liberation, the title may give a misleading impression of cooperation amongst the groups. In reality, they fought each other nearly as often as they engaged ‘class enemies,’ often in petty squabbles over turf or ideological nuances. 163 Prakash Singh, 124. 164 Ibid., 129-141. 165 Ibid., 140 YEAR INCIDENTS KILLED 1981 53 10 1982 98 18 1983 172 17 1984 306 30 1985 308 30 1986 161 25 1987 252 63 1988 453 59 1989 456 84 1990 735 94 Table 1. Naxalite Violence in Andhra Pradesh 50 Nevertheless, they too managed to make an impact at the state level. Like Telangana, Bihar remained beyond the reach of many of the government’s reform initiatives, and pockets of rural unrest continued to provide havens for Naxalite cadres.166 Though Liberation was the largest of the three groups, its gradual embrace of electoral politics over the course of the decade made it the least violently active. It maintained an armed wing into the 1990s, but its aboveground political organization, the Indian People’s Front, increasingly supplanted the influence of its more belligerent cadres.167 The faction favoring normalization gained dominance in 1992, and Liberation thereafter functioned primarily as an aboveground outfit, focused almost exclusively on peaceful mass organization.168 In a telling signal of the extent of their moderation, its leaders even called for rapprochement with the formerly despised CPI and CPI-(M), in an effort to build a more coordinated leftist political front.169 By contrast, the MCC and Party Unity remained exclusively committed to armed revolution. Mass organization was desirable, but in the context of a burgeoning caste conflict in the state during this period, often difficult to mobilize along exclusively class lines. Instead, the annihilation strategy was pursued with a decidedly grisly purpose, particularly by the MCC. In most cases, upper caste jotedars and their families were the primary targets but, with the conflation of caste and class conflicts in the state, the sadistic nature of the killings failed to generate the same backlash that had occurred previously. As a result, both the MCC and Party Unity were able to carve out small areas of influence in Bihar over the latter half of the 1980s.170 As in Andhra Pradesh, however, this level of activity remained a far cry from that of 1967-1972. 166 Prakash Singh, 148-160. 167 Tilak, 19. 168 Prakash Singh, 158. 169 Tilak, 20. 170 Prakash Singh, 148-156, 159-160. 51 D. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 1. Center Responses From the halls of power in New Delhi, Naxalism appeared to be a spent force after 1972. With the center caught up in the drama of systemic political change and the growth of ethnic secessionist movements over these two decades, relatively scant attention was paid to the fractured and localized Maoist movement in the country. Nevertheless, as alluded in Section 3.2, developments at the national level did have an impact on the Naxalites. With the INC’s turn to a more populist platform, new rural development and land reform initiatives effectively undercut the movement’s base of support. With rural inequality receding rather than growing, the more militant cadres had a much harder time finding sympathetic base areas from which to operate. Even for those sections of the movement that drifted in a more moderate direction, the government’s schemes were successful in stealing their rhetorical thunder and foiling most attempts at mass organization; Naxalite candidates did not generally have much success at the polls, Santosh Rana’s success notwithstanding.171 While these developments posed indirect problems for the Naxalites, a much more immediate challenge emerged with the imposition of the Emergency in 1975. Though not primarily directed at the Naxalites, the resultant political and security crackdowns hit the movement hard. Like most other opposition groups, all Naxalite organizations were banned and scores of leaders and party activists rearrested under the newly instituted Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA).172 Among them were some of the Maoists’ most effective organizers, including Kanu Sanyal, Ashim Chatterjee, and Satyanarayan Singh. Moreover, the security forces were given wide latitude in dealing with whatever opposition escaped the prison cell. Frequently, this entailed direct action like that of ‘Operation Thunder,’ which crushed the long-simmering 171 Prakash Singh, 211-212. 172 Banerjee, 297. 52 unrest in Bhojpur with combined operations by the military and Central Reserve Police forces in 1977.173 Already in tatters after Mazumdar’s death, the Naxalite movement was nearly destroyed by the center’s expanded powers during the Emergency.174 Ironically, it was also New Delhi that granted it a new lease on life. The Janata government’s promises to undo the excesses of the Emergency resulted in the release of hundreds of Naxalite prisoners all across the country in 1977 and 1978, the legalization of most of their organizations, and the easing of pressure by government security forces.175 While this ultimately had the effect of moderating several factions and co\u0002opting them into the political process, it also freed the more hard-core cadres to resume their subversive activities. Though the INC returned to power in New Delhi in 1980, it did not resume its previous activities against the Naxalites. In part, this was due to the still extremely weak state of the movement. More importantly, however, the government already had its hands full with the growing unrest in Punjab and the Northeast. Nevertheless, the center’s security initiatives with respect to these other regions reverberated among the Naxalites. The extremely aggressive response to these insurgencies likely helped convince the more moderate Maoists that the path of armed rebellion was untenable and provided some deterrent effect even to their more violent-minded brethren. Whatever the case, Naxalite violence remained at a sufficiently low ebb through the 1980s to permit the central government to largely dismiss it as a local law and order problem. The same could not necessarily be said for those states that were more directly affected. 2. State Responses As the birthplace of Naxalism, West Bengal had the longest history in dealing with the insurgency. While effective policing put down the 1973-74 uprising of Mahadev Mukherjee’s faction, rural unrest continued to simmer under a series of Congress administrations. When a Left Front coalition government returned to power in 1977, 173 Prakash Singh, 119. 174 Mehra, 51-52. 175 Prakash Singh, 122; Tilak, 12. 53 however, the situation changed dramatically. Led by the CPI-(M), the new administration proved much more competent and enduring than its predecessors. Under its direction, West Bengal instituted a series of land redistribution and rural development initiatives that proved remarkably successful. One of these was ‘Operation Barga,’ which established strict ceilings on total landholdings by individuals and granted inheritable ownership rights to tenant farmers and sharecroppers.176 Unencumbered by the political compromises, conflicts of interest, and enforcement issues that so often plagued center\u0002led efforts, these state-level reforms removed the Maoists’ raison d’etre in a few short years. By the early 1980s, Naxalism had ceased to be a force of any consequence in the state.177 Though not as successful as West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh was able to mount an intermittently effective counter to its Naxalite problem. The TDP, which came to power in 1983, initially pursued a policy of appeasement with the PWG in an effort to lure them to peace talks. When it became clear that the group had no intention of negotiating in good faith (and had, in fact, used the opportunity to consolidate and strengthen their positions), the state’s Chief Minister, N.T. Rama Rao, adopted a hard line against the Naxalites.178 Rao authorized aggressive policing measures against PWG cadres and oversaw the formation of the Greyhounds, the state’s elite anti-Naxal police unit, in the late 1980s.179 Though he supported aggressive security measures, Rao did not neglect the rural development initiatives that had proved so successful in West Bengal. Land reform and rural employment initiatives were implemented with moderate success, but a lack of government infrastructure in remoter parts of the state made their implementation there difficult.180 In 1989, the INC returned to power in state elections, but initially made the same early mistakes as the TDP. The new Chief Minister, Chenna Reddy, tried to 176 Prakash Singh, 179. 177 Mehra, 56; Prakash Singh, 236. 178 Prakash Singh, 139. 179 Andhra Pradesh State Police, “Units: Greyhounds,” http://www.apstatepolice.org/AboutUs/units/units_greyhounds.htm (accessed February 4, 2008). 180 K.C. Suri, “Telugu Desam Party,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 294-295. 54 appease the PWG in a vain attempt to lure them into the mainstream, releasing several hundred Naxalite prisoners rounded up under the previous administration.181 When this approach failed again, Reddy reverted to Rao’s combination of tough policing and socio\u0002economic development. Despite these ups and downs, the state was relatively successful in confining the PWG to the Telangana region and a few neighboring districts throughout the 1980s. By contrast, the containment of the MCC and Party Unity in Bihar had little to do with the state government. The Janata Party captured control of the state briefly, from 1977 to 1980, but the remainder of this period was dominated by INC administrations. In reality, however, it scarcely mattered who controlled the government. Corruption, cronyism, and maladministration took root in Bihar in the 1970s and continued to flourish through the 1980s.182 Unable to mount effective security or development initiatives of any kind, the government essentially left the rural parts of the state to their own devices, providing space for the embers of Naxalism to smolder. While the growth of caste conflict in the state, as well as internecine fighting between the MCC and PU, were enough to keep the Naxalites more or less in check during these decades, the state’s appallingly poor governance would become an issue in the future resurgence of Naxalism. E. CONCLUSION The Fragmentary Period was a prolonged low point in the history of Naxalism in India. After its brief but significant surge from 1967 to 1972, the movement underwent a period of stagnation and decay that lasted nearly two decades and effectively removed it from the public consciousness. Though not as captivating a story as the vitality of the previous period, the impotence of the movement and its singular inability to gain traction during these years are still worthy of examination. 181 Sanjoy Hazarika, “Indian Rebel Group is Linked to Train Attack,” New York Times, October 21, 1990. 182 Prakash Singh, 148-150. 55 The most obvious reason for the failure of Naxalism in this period was its own organizational weakness. Fractured into dozens of smaller, competing factions, it was too dispersed and fragmented to mount any kind of meaningful challenge to the forces of the Indian state. In large part, this was a failure of leadership. Consumed by their personal egos, strategic and tactical differences, and ideological arguments incomprehensible to any but the most dogmatic Marxists, the heads of the various Naxalite organizations were utterly incapable of resolving their disputes and coordinating the activities of their disparate groups. As a consequence, a large portion of the movement effectively abandoned the revolutionary line, and those that remained were confined to a few small pockets of activity in the hinterlands. With the structure of the movement in such a state, its success would have been unlikely in even a permissive security environment. As it turned out, the security environment was decidedly unfavorable. The imposition of the Emergency in the 1970s granted the state a great deal of leeway in dealing with opposition movements, and it used them to devastating affect against the already fragmented Naxalites. Indeed, the movement was very nearly destroyed by policing actions like Operation Thunder and the imprisonment of hundreds, if not thousands of its activists. The situation in the 1980s was hardly any better. Though New Delhi’s aggressive reactions to the various secessionist uprisings in the country were not directed against the Maoists, they still provided a powerful deterrent effect. Lastly, the social, economic, and political conditions in the country were not conducive to the spread of Naxalite ideology. Political changes at the systemic level gave a new voice to groups the Maoists traditionally relied on for support, making the government more responsive to their needs. As a result, land reforms and rural development became a priority at both the state and national levels. While these programs were not always perfectly implemented, poverty rates did decline, and real and perceived inequity were alleviated to some degree. These issues had been drivers of rural unrest in the previous period, and the government’s efforts to address them proved generally successful in keeping the countryside peaceful during these decades. 56 To most observers in 1991, the Naxalist threat appeared to be over. The movement had been wiped out in the state of its birth, sizeable numbers of its former adherents were embracing electoral democracy, and, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Communism was being discredited around the world. In isolated pockets of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, however, the embers of the Maoist revolution continued to smolder. In places the rural reforms had scarcely reached, the People’s War Group, Maoist Communist Center, and Party Unity continued to cling to existence, waiting for the right moment to reignite the fire of Naxalbari. 57 IV. THE RECONSOLIDATION PERIOD (1991-PRESENT) A. INTRODUCTION With an analysis of the first two periods of Naxalite activity complete, this chapter now turns to the most recent iteration of Maoist violence in India. In an examination of the historical evolution of Naxalism, the period from 1991 to the present is certainly the most paradoxical. In the course of little more than 17 years, India has transformed from a large, but isolated and relatively weak state, to one of the central players in the emerging geopolitical order. Its macroeconomic growth is astounding, second only to China in the developing world, and its diplomatic clout on the world stage has increased commensurately. To many outside observers, India looks to be successfully integrating itself into the modern world. And yet, in those same 17 years, an archaic Communist ideology, rejected even in the place of its birth, was also in the ascendancy. Written off by most security analysts in the ashes of the Fragmentary Period from 1972-1991, Naxalism staged a spectacular comeback in the following decades, growing in scope, breadth, and violence. By 2006, its impact was so great that Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was forced to declare, “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problem of Naxalism is the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”183 This is certainly a startling announcement for a nation that suffered through the chaos of Partition, witnessed the violence of a Sikh rebellion in the Punjab, and is still confronted by the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, various insurgencies in the Northeast, fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and continuing Hindu-Muslim communal strife. What explains Naxalism’s phoenix-like rebirth in a period that has witnessed such phenomenal growth and national development? 183 Manmohan Singh, “Prime Minister’s Speech to the 2nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of Chief Ministers on Naxalism,” 13 April 2006, Government of India Press Information Bureau, http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=17128, (accessed August 10, 2007). 58 B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments Since 1991, the most striking development in Indian politics has been the emergence of a truly multi-polar power structure. The declining hegemony of the INC (discussed in the previous chapter) dramatically accelerated during the 1990s, fuelled by the emergence of the “Three M’s” on the political scene: Mandir, Mandal, and Market Reforms.184 In 1998, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition unseated the previous INC administration and inaugurated the longest period of uninterrupted rule by a non\u0002Congress party since independence. Though the INC returned to power in 2004, the BJP’s ascendancy in the 1990s definitively marked the end of one-party dominance in India, resulting in a more complex and contentious political setting than at any other time in the nation’s history. Minority governments and coalition politics are now the order of the day, severely restricting New Delhi’s freedom of action in addressing many pressing issues. In many ways, this increasing gridlock at the national level is reflected in interactions between the central government and those of the states. India’s political structure is distinctly federal, with the 28 state and 7 union territory governments retaining high levels of autonomy from New Delhi, barring the infrequent imposition of ‘President’s Rule’ from the center. This is particularly true with respect to internal security, an area in which the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India grants the individual states great authority and latitude.185 Such a division of powers presents obvious problems for policy coordination, especially when different parties control the various levels of government. This situation was not much of an issue in earlier decades, 184 ‘Mandir’ refers to Hindu Nationalism, ‘Mandal’ to the recommendations of the Mandal Commission report on the status of backward castes, and ‘Market Reforms’ to the economic reforms inaugurated in 1991. For an excellent exposition of these phenomena and their impact on Indian politics, see: Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952- 2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed.

Previously, operations in remote and interior areas used to be paused during the rains, inadvertently giving space to Maoists to carry out recruitment drives or hold meetings with villagers. For the past three-four years, however, specially trained units of state and central security forces have pressed on with operations in forests in monsoon, resulting in the killing of 29 Maoists in encounters since 2020. The past years’ operations have been an example against the perceived notion that security forces wouldn’t be able to carry out operations due to overflowing nullahs, canals and slippery terrain in the forests of Bastar, a Police officer said. Bastar range Inspector general of Police (IGP) Sundarraj P told that security camps established in more than 60 spots in the remote areas have “choked the Maoists” and become “bottleneck points” for movement of the insurgents, while giving forces access to the forests. “Earlier, operations would be stalled but for the past 3-4 years, our ops continue during the (rainy) season, bringing results. CRPF \\[Central Reserve Police Force\\], CoBRA \\[Commando Battalion for resolute Action\\] and Special Task Force \\[STF\\] will be carrying out operations as they are well trained in jungle warfare. An action plan is in place to deal with the challenges of monsoon in the forest and conduct searches,” Sundarraj said. The inter-state operations on bordering areas like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra will also be intensified in the coming weeks and the jawans were well equipped for it. The morale of SFs is high despite casualties, the senior Police officer said. “We have recorded significant positive operational outcomes during this monsoon, since we have made decisive inroads into the erstwhile Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] strongholds by opening strategic operational base camps,” said Sundarraj. **Read less...** | | July - 12 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kot **Read more...** The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kothagudem of Telangana on July 12, reports Telangana Today. Jagan called upon the public to revolt against the ‘fascist Brahmanical Hindutva agenda of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of the UCC. As the people’s opposition towards the BJP’s nine-year rule was on the rise, the BJP was planning to execute its divisive and communal agenda. Through the UCC, Hindutva forces want to create a nefarious divisive line based on religion prior to the five state elections and the general election in 2024. In the last nine years of Narendra Modi's rule, the Indian economy has witnessed prolonged stagnation and decline, he said. Poverty, diseases, the gap between the rich and the poor, and attacks on minorities, dalits, and adivasis have reached levels never seen before. More than 800 million people have been pushed below the poverty line. Jagan noted that the BJP was trying to divert all these from the public’s mind. There would be a threat to the religious rights of minorities, tribals, and even Hindus because of the UCC. The BJP was also dehumanising the Muslim community and wrongly projecting them. There was a need to build a mass movement against the UCC, Jagan added. **Read less...** | | July - 13 | The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. The Maoist leaders for whom wanted notices were issued are Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, and Venkata Ravi Chaitanya alias Aruna. In its statement, the NIA said Aruna and Gajarla Ravi are the key executors of the Maoist strategies in Andhra Pradesh. The NIA informed us further that Aruna led the Maoist group that killed the former MLAs. The double murder took place while Kidari Sarveshwara Rao and Siveri Soma were visiting an interior village in the Araku assembly constituency of Andhra Pradesh. NIA re-registered the case on December 6, 2018 and took up the investigation. In June 2021, the NIA filed a supplementary chargesheet in the case against a woman area committee member of the Maoist group.

Maharashtra forces, which have already alerted the Central Government about the Maoists trying to bounce back in Chhattisgarh, have put their security and intelligence units on high alert on the stretch between Kanker-Narayanpur and Bijapur national park. A senior official from the security and intelligence wings said around 1,000 cadres have been recruited by the Maoists in Dantewada and Sukma regions. Another 200–250 new cadres were recruited by the Maoists in South Bastar. \"Earlier, there were barely 50–100 cadres in south Bastar and 200–400 in Dantewada and Sukma, which now have swelled to a substantial number after fresh recruitment,\" said the official. He said the concern was that Maoists would regroup and try to bounce back to their former strength in Chhattisgarh, which would not augur well for Gadchiroli and Gondia across the border in Maharashtra. Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) Sandip Patil, also the chief of the Anti-Naxal Operations (ANO) for Maharashtra, said the central government has been briefed about the developments in Chhattisgarh, which may now affect Maharashtra too, but did not divulge further details. \"Maharashtra forces are ready with strategies to counter any fresh threats,\" he said. It’s been learned that the Maoists are planning major attacks on Police posts that the Governments of different states are opening in their strongholds in central India. The Maoists’ ‘technical and research’ wing is said to be developing Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED) to blow them up near Police posts after mounting them on tractors or four-wheelers used in the rural areas. The Maoists are also developing drones to carry and drop up to five kilograms of explosives on Police Stations.

The anti-Naxal crackdown by the Special Task Force (STF) along with other Security Forces (SFs) has dried up the weapons pipeline, leading to the number of armed extremists dropping drastically in the state, said a senior Police officer. \"Now the Bihar Police, in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and other concerned wings of the government, have intensified their crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui districts in the state\", Sushil Mansingh Khopde, Additional Director General (ADG-operations), STF, said. The ADG said despite law enforcement agencies destroying hundreds of acres of poppy plants each year, inputs suggest that clandestine opium poppy cultivation is present in certain pockets in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts. \"Inputs also suggest that Maoists \\[Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist)\\] have been using opium cultivation as a source of revenue in these areas. They levy a 'tax' on poppy cultivators and small enterprises. Law enforcement agencies destroyed around 600 acres of poppy plantation in these areas in 2021, and in 2022, around 1200 acres were destroyed\", the ADG said, adding, \"The concerned district police and other agencies have been instructed to keep a vigil on clandestine opium poppy cultivation in specific areas in the district.\" Further, ADG Khopde said, \"The number of Maoist-affected districts will further reduce in the coming months. No major Maoist incidents have been reported till June this year. Some armed cadres are only concentrated on the hills of Chakarbandha on the Gaya-Aurangabad border near Jharkhand and in the hilly areas of Jamui and Lakhisarai-Munger.

While none of Odisha districts has a cadre Maoist, we have to be more alert in the areas of those districts that share borders with Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, and Jharkhand, he added. **Read less...** | [ADVANCED SEARCH](javascript:ShowModalPopup('dvDetails');) [Incident Year Wise](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2023) [Incidents- 2025](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2025) [Incidents- 2024](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2024) [Incidents- 2023](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2023) [Incidents- 2022](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2022) [Incidents- 2021](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2021) [Incidents- 2020](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2020) [Incidents- 2019](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2019) [Incidents- 2018](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2018) [Incidents- 2017](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2017) [Incidents- 2016](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2016) [Incidents- 2015](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2015) [Incidents- 2014](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2014) [Incidents- 2013](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2013) [Incidents- 2012](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2012) [Incidents- 2011](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2011) [Incidents- 2010](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2010) [Incidents- 2009](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2009) [Incidents- 2008](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2008) [Incidents- 2007](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2007) [Incidents- 2006](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2006) [Incidents- 2005](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2005) [Incidents- 2004](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2004) [Incidents- 2003](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2003) [Incidents- 2002](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2002) [Incidents- 2001](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2001) [Incidents- 2000](https://satp.org/other-data/india-maoistinsurgency/statement_2000) ![close](https://satp.org/App_Themes/Admin/Images/Icons/x.png) | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Country : | --All--AfghanistanBangladeshBhutanIndiaMaldivesNepalPakistanSri Lanka | Zone : | --All-- | | State : | --All-- | District : | --All-- | | Date From : | The Valid date is required | Date To: | The Valid date is required | | |",

    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#content) Author ### [Pearl Pandya](https://acleddata.com/staff/pearl-pandya) South Asia Research Manager _On 21 May, Indian security forces killed the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI (Maoist)), Nambala Keshava Rao, also known as Basavaraju, in Chhattisgarh state. He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&nbsp;_ _In this Q&A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world._ ## **The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it?** The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed.[1](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote1) So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( _see graph below_). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.[2](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote2) Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts.[3](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote3) Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. Close footnote ## How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also [targeted locals](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/) whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes.[4](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote4) Close footnote ## What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk.[5](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote5) And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so.

SFs recovered one AK47 rifle, one Light Machine Gun (LMG) and explosives from the encounter spot. The identities of the slain Maoists are yet to be ascertained. On April 5, 2024, one CPI-Maoist cadre was gunned down by SFs in the forest area near Kirandul in the Dantewada District of Chhattisgarh. During the search, SFs recovered the dead body of the Maoist, his weapon and explosives from the encounter site. On April 2, 2024, 13 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in a forest near Lendra village under the Gangaloor Police Station limits of the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh. The identity of the dead Maoists was yet to be ascertained, but _prima facie_, it appeared that they belonged to the Maoist’s PLGA (People's Liberation Guerrilla Army) Company No. 2, a senior Police official disclosed. Police recovered weapons, including a Light Machine Gun (LMG), a .303 rifle, and a 12-bore gun, along with a substantial quantity of barrel grenade launchers, shells, and other arms and ammunition, from the site. On April 1, 2024, two CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in the Kerajhari Forest of the Balaghat District in Madhya Pradesh. The Police recovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist ‘divisional committee member (DCM)’ Sajanti _aka_ Kranti and ‘area committee member (ACM)’ Raghu _aka_ Sher Singh (54), both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounty announcements by the Police in three states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Elsewhere on the same day, one CPI-Maoist cadre was killed in an encounter with SFs in the forest area near Tetemadgu village under Kistaram Police Station limits in the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh. The dead body of the Maoist and his weapons were recovered from the encounter site. The identity of the slain Maoist is yet to be ascertained. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), at least 58 _Naxalites_ \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] have been killed by the SFs during the current year, 2024 (data till April 7). During the corresponding period of 2023, SFs had eliminated nine _Naxalites_. Through 2023, SFs killed 58 _Naxalites_, in addition to 67 killed in 2022. According to the SATP database, SFs arrested 401 _Naxalites_ in 2023 as against 395 arrests in 2022. In 2024, as on April 7, the number of arrests stood at 92. Since March 6, 2000, according to SATP data, 16,364 _Naxalites_ have been arrested (data till April 7, 2024). Through 2023, SFs recovered weapons and ammunition from the Maoists in 223 incidents, in addition to 193 such incidents of recovery in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the number of such incidents was 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,917 incidents of arms recovery are on record. Mounting pressure on the _Naxalites_ has resulted in a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP data, at least 254 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2023, in addition to 2,855 surrenders in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, 42 surrenders have been recorded. Since March 6, 2000, 16,780 _Naxalites_ have surrendered (data till April 7, 2024). Continuing SF successes on the ground further improved the overall security situation through 2023. The trend of declining overall fatalities, on year-on-year basis, in Left Wing Extremism-related violence, has been established since 2018, though a marginal reversal occurred in 2023 at around 11.11 per cent (from 135 in 2022 to 150 in 2023). According to SATP data, a total of 150 people (61 civilians, 31 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_) were killed in such violence through 2023, as against 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) recorded in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the total number of such fatalities stood at 93 (22 civilians, 13 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_), as against 37 such fatalities (19 civilians, nine SF personnel and nine _Naxalites_) reported during the corresponding period of 2023. According to SATP data, the number of civilian fatalities (61) recorded through 2023 was the third lowest in this category since 2000. Two other previous lows were recorded at 53 in 2022 and 58 in 2021. A third low of 61 was also recorded in 2020. The maximum number of civilians killed in such violence, 630, was in 2010. Though the number of fatalities among SFs increased from 15 in 2022 to 31 in 2023, according to SATP data, the number of fatalities in 2023 was the second lowest in this category since 2000. A previous low of 15 was recorded in 2022. The maximum number of SFs killed in such violence, 319, was in 2009. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2023, at 1:1.87, improving the ratio in favour of the SFs in 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2022, the ratio was at 1:4.46, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Also, in 2009 the ratio was at 1.01:1. In 2007, the ratio was at 1.2:1 favouring the Maoists. However, since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.63). In the current year, the kill ratio remains in favour of the SFs at 1:4.46, so far (data till April 7, 2024). Other parameters of violence indicate that, despite sustained SF pressure, the Maoists but retain significant operational capabilities across the country. At least eight major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) were recorded in 2023, compared to seven such incidents in 2022. There were 89 incidents of exchange of fire between SFs and Maoist in 2023, compared to 86 such incidents in 2022. Further, the Maoists orchestrated at least 62 incidents of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in 2023, compared to 32 such incidents in 2022. Moreover, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents of violence increased marginally from 602 in 2022 to 603 in 2023. In particular, incidents in which the Maoists killed civilians and SFs increased from 63 in 2022 to 77 in 2023. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from 12 States in 2023, in comparison to 10 States in 2022. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 12 affected States have a total of 83 Districts which recorded a Maoist presence. Of these, seven districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 20 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 56 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2022, of 57 affected districts from 10 states, two districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 27 were ‘marginally affected’. However, in a written reply to a question in the _Rajya Sabha_ (Upper House of the Indian Parliament) on February 7, 2024, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai claimed that the resolute implementation of the “National Policy and Action Plan (NPAP) to address LWE” approved in 2015, resulted in a consistent decline in violence and constriction of the geographical spread of LWE influence. LWE-related violence and resultant deaths (Civilians + Security Forces) declined by 73 per cent from a high in 2010, by 90 per cent in 2022, and by 86 per cent in 2023. Further, Rai stated that the number of Police Stations reporting LWE-related violence had reduced significantly, from 465 Police Stations across 96 districts in 2010 to 176 Police Stations across 45 districts in 2022 and 171 Police Stations across 42 districts in 2023. Clearly, all major LWE-affected states across the country – see Andhra Pradesh’s **[Residual Vexations](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-29#assessment2)**, Bihar’s **[Halted Menace](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-35#assessment2)**, Chhattisgarh’s **[Persisting Disruptions](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-33#assessment2)**, Jharkhand’s **[Risks amidst decline](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-31#assessment2)**, Madhya Pradesh’s **[Enduring Risks](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-41#assessment2)**, Maharashtra’s **[Ineffective ‘Revival’](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-36#assessment2)**, Odisha’s **[Enduring challenges](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-34#assessment2)**, and Telangana’s **[Sustained Dominance](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-37#assessment2)** have recorded substantial improvement in the security situation in the regions affected by LWE activity. Earlier, on January 21, 2024, the union home minister (UHM) Amit Shah, had asserted that the country would be free from the menace of _Naxalism_ in the next three years, and directed states to expedite development activities in remote areas affected by the ultras. UHM Shah also directed the Security Forces (SFs) to financially choke the ultras and instructed officials to prepare a blueprint to end _Naxalism_. He also stressed the need for expediting development in _Naxalite_-affected areas, asserting that all welfare schemes of the central and state governments would have to be implemented in these areas with renewed vigour. Meanwhile, on January 11, 2024, the Chhattisgarh government invited Maoists to hold unconditional talks, suggesting \"video calls if they are reluctant to come for physical meetings\". Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma, who holds the state's Home portfolio, stating that this would be a step towards restoring peace and stability in the Bastar region, thus observed, | | | --- | | We are prepared to provide Naxalites an online platform to express their grievances, ideas and desires. I am open to discussions with the young cadres any time, 24x7, without any conditions. I am available for any topic the Naxalites wish to discuss, but they must be willing to engage. If they regret their decision to join the outfit or wish to reintegrate with mainstream society, I extend my hand to them and urge them to lead a peaceful life and serve the country. | While holding out an olive branch, the Government made it clear that there would be no softening of stance. The Deputy Chief Minister thus warned, | | | --- | | If they fail to grasp the importance of dialogue, they will have to pay for the pain they have inflicted on our people ('dard ka hisaab hoga'). They must understand that peace talks cannot occur with guns and bullets. A well-ordered society is not governed by firearms. We want to discuss what they desire, why they carry weapons, why they mislead and trouble people, why they oppose progress in villages, and why they do not support the establishment of hospitals, schools, water facilities, and _anganwadis_. | Meanwhile, according to a March 21, 2024, media report, Chhattisgarh's Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma's call for unconditional dialogue with Maoists prompted a response from the CPI-Maoist, with the rebels presenting certain preconditions and emphasizing the necessity of a conducive environment for talks to ensure the welfare and lasting peace of oppressed and exploited segments of society. In a letter, CPI-Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) 'spokesman' Vikalp outlined several conditions before any agreement could be reached to engage in dialogue. These conditions included the cessation of atrocities and false encounters on tribals, halting militarization in tribal regions, withdrawing security forces, and annulling agreements with corporate entities. In a two-page letter dated March 15, 2024, Maoist spokesperson Vikalp declared that, if their demands were met, they would be ready to engage in dialogue via mobile phone calls. He noted, further, | | | --- | | We had previously responded to the invitation for talks, stating that our central agenda is none other than the overall development of the oppressed and harassed sections of society, including tribal, Dalit, Muslim, and minority communities, as well as farmers, women, and the middle class. Additionally, we advocate for equal pay for equal work based on gender equality and an end to state violence against women. | Vikalp also insisted on providing loan waivers for farmers, increasing agricultural subsidies, providing free irrigation and electricity, cancelling agreements with international companies, and implementing welfare schemes such as free education, housing, healthcare, and employment. The Maoists thus gave _bandh_ (general shut down strike) calls on their whims. In their latest call on March 30, 2024, the Maoists called for a _bandh_ in Bijapur and Sukma on April 3, 2024, to protest the killing of six Maoists in an encounter in the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh on March 27, 2024, which the rebels claimed was a \"fake encounter\". However, the _bandh_ calls were peaceful. Rejecting the allegations of fake encounters as \"old tactics\" of the Maoists, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar range, Sundarraj P., asserted, | | | --- | | It is the typical _modus operandi_ of Maoists to level allegations against the security forces to puncture the credibility of security forces. Maoists conveniently forget that they are responsible for brutal killings of hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians. Just to distract the attention from their inhumane behaviour, they issue these kinds of statements. All concerned understand the reality that the Maoists are facing their extinction. | Earlier, on March 26, 2024, Mohan, the ‘secretary’ of the CPI-Maoist West Bastar Division Committee, had issued a press note which announced that Bijapur would remain closed on March 30. In the note the Maoist leader accused the Police of killing 15 tribals since January. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government in Chhattisgarh has been accused of fake encounters, atrocities, and the eviction of tribals from forests and land, and denial of access to water resources. The Maoists warned transporters and businessmen that they would be responsible if they operated on March 30. However, the _bandh_ passed without any disruptive activities. The Maoists issued nine _Bandh_ calls in 2023 across the country, as against eight such calls in 2022. The Maoist movement has weakened, as the SFs now increasingly dominate areas long under LWE sway. Nevertheless, the capacities to sustain dominance remain limited. According to _Bureau of Police Research and Development_ (BPR&D) data, the all-India Police-population ratio was 152.80 (as on January 1, 2022), in comparison to 152.51 per 100,000 on January 1, 2021. Some of the Maoists’ affected States have much worse police-population ratios: Bihar, at 75.16; Odisha at 122.59; and Maharashtra at 136.45. Even in States like Jharkhand, where the police-population ratio, at 162.73, exceeds the national average, it remains much lower than the 220/100,000 ratio regarded as desirable for 'peacetime policing'. Moreover, there were 504 (17.59 per cent) vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) in the 12 affected States, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. Further, huge vacancies persist in the total strength of the State Police forces, which have been increasingly used in the fight against the _Naxalites_: there were 417,784 vacant posts in the 12 affected States, as on January 1, 2022, against a sanctioned strength of 1,642,759 (actual strength: 1,224,965). Significantly, these constituted 72.3 per cent of the 595,105 vacant posts across India, as on January 1, 2022. Moreover, against a sanctioned strength of 324,654 in the CRPF, the lead counter-insurgency Force in the country, the actual strength stood at 309,544, a vacancy of 15,110 personnel. Stark deficits are visible in some of the worst afflicted States. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2022, there were at least 22 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst _Naxalism_-affected State, which did not have a telephone. Similarly, the second worst affected State, Jharkhand, had 211 such Police Stations without telephone connections. The number of Police Stations without a vehicle in Jharkhand was 47, while 31 Police stations in the state hand no wireless/mobile phone. The Maoists are certainly losing their impact across the country; however, the danger of resurgence remains alive. There is urgent need to build the necessary capacities to sustain, indeed, heighten pressure at this stage, in order to consolidate the gains of recent years. | [Assessments Year

    "title": "The Rising Tide of Cyber Threats: How Hackers Are Targeting Global Water Infrastructure",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "**Executive Summary** Water infrastructure has emerged as one of the most vulnerable and strategically important targets in the global cybersecurity landscape. Recent data from Britain's Drinking Water Inspectorate reveals five cyberattacks on UK water suppliers since January 2024, marking a record number in any two-year period. This alarming trend is part of a broader international pattern where nation-state actors, ransomware groups, and hacktivists increasingly view water systems as high-value targets for disruption, espionage, and financial extortion. Despite this escalating threat, most attacks have not yet disrupted actual water supplies—though experts warn this is more a matter of luck than robust security. ## The UK Water Sector Under Siege Britain's drinking water watchdog has disclosed unprecedented insight into the cyber threats facing one of the nation's most critical infrastructure sectors. Between January 1, 2024, and October 20, 2025, the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) received 15 security reports from water suppliers under the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Regulations. Of these, five involved cybersecurity incidents affecting what the DWI termed \"out-of-NIS-scope systems\"—infrastructure not directly involved in water treatment or distribution but still connected to organizational networks. While none of these incidents disrupted the safe supply of drinking water, their occurrence highlights what British intelligence agencies identify as an escalating threat to critical national infrastructure. The fact that water companies voluntarily reported these incidents, despite not being legally required to do so under current regulations, suggests a growing awareness of the cyber risk landscape among utilities. ### The Reporting Gap and Regulatory Evolution Under current UK regulations, the NIS framework only mandates disclosure of cyber incidents that actually result in disruption to essential services. This creates a dangerous blind spot: sophisticated pre-positioning campaigns, like those conducted by Chinese state-sponsored group Volt Typhoon, would not trigger mandatory reporting requirements even if discovered. Volt Typhoon represents one of the most significant strategic threats to water infrastructure globally. As detailed in [comprehensive research on critical infrastructure attacks](https://breached.company/briefing-on-the-2025-cybersecurity-landscape-key-threats-trends-and-incidents/), U.S. intelligence agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors have been pre-positioning themselves on IT networks since at least 2021 to enable lateral movement to operational technology (OT) assets. FBI Director Christopher Wray described Volt Typhoon as \"the defining threat of our generation,\" noting that the group has maintained access to some victim environments for at least five years. British officials recognize this reporting gap and plan to address it through the much-delayed Cyber Security and Resilience Bill, expected to be introduced to Parliament later in 2025. A government spokesperson confirmed: \"The cyber threats we face are sophisticated, relentless and costly. Our Cyber Security and Resilience Bill will be introduced to Parliament this year and is designed to strengthen our cyber defences—protecting the services the public rely on so they can go about their normal lives.\" ## The Global Water Infrastructure Crisis The UK incidents represent only a fraction of a worldwide surge in attacks targeting water systems. The scale of vulnerability is staggering: the United States alone operates approximately 152,000-170,000 public drinking water and wastewater systems, many using outdated technology with limited cybersecurity resources. ### Record-Breaking Attack Volumes The water sector experienced unprecedented cyber activity throughout 2024 and into 2025: - **American Water**, the largest regulated water utility in the United States, suffered a major cyberattack in October 2024 that forced the shutdown of customer billing systems and affected operations serving more than 14 million people - **Southern Water** in the UK reported a significant data breach in February 2024 that exposed personal and operational data of customers and employees - **Arkansas City Water Treatment Facility** in Kansas experienced a cybersecurity incident that required switching to manual operations - **Synnovis**, a critical pathology service provider in the UK, suffered a devastating Qilin ransomware attack that disrupted healthcare services - **Canadian utilities** reported incidents where hacktivists successfully changed water pressure at local facilities, interfering with industrial control systems According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement alert issued in May 2024, more than 70% of water systems inspected failed to fully comply with Safe Drinking Water Act requirements. The EPA identified \"alarming cybersecurity vulnerabilities\" including: - Default passwords that had never been updated - Vulnerable single login setups without multi-factor authentication - Former employees who retained systems access - Inadequate network segmentation between IT and OT systems ## The Threat Actor Landscape Multiple adversary categories target water infrastructure, each with distinct motivations and capabilities. ### Nation-State Actors **Chinese Groups** lead in sophistication and strategic patience. Beyond Volt Typhoon, Chinese-nexus groups including Salt Typhoon, Linen Typhoon, and Violet Typhoon have conducted widespread campaigns targeting critical infrastructure. As documented in [our analysis of China's cyber campaigns](https://breached.company/summer-2025-cyber-attack-retrospective/), these groups focus on pre-positioning for potential disruption rather than immediate espionage value. CrowdStrike reported a 150% increase in observed China-nexus adversary activity in 2024-2025, with telecommunications, government, and critical infrastructure representing primary targets. The groups employ \"living off the land\" (LOTL) techniques—using legitimate administrative tools to blend into normal network activity and evade detection. **Iranian-Affiliated Groups** have demonstrated both capability and willingness to disrupt water operations. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)-affiliated group \"CyberAv3ngers\" (also known as Storm-0784 or Shahid Kaveh Group) has specifically targeted water infrastructure: - November 2023: Defaced a water controller in Pennsylvania as part of cyber-enabled influence operations - December 2023: Attacked a private group water scheme in County Mayo, Ireland, leaving residents without water for several days by compromising an internet-connected controller - Multiple incidents targeting Unitronics programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used throughout the U.S. water sector The U.S. federal government issued specific warnings about the exploitation of Unitronics PLCs, noting that these devices—commonly used in water and wastewater facilities—were being indiscriminately targeted because they were manufactured in Israel. **Russian-Linked Hacktivists** continue to target water infrastructure, particularly in geopolitical context. The \"People's Cyber Army of Russia\" claimed credit for cyberattacks on the Tipton West Wastewater Treatment Plant in Indiana (April 2024) and a water facility in Muleshoe, Texas, near a U.S. Air Force base (January 2024). ### Ransomware Groups [Ransomware operations](https://breached.company/ransomware-onslaught-multiple-groups-post-fresh-victims-on-october-3-2025/) increasingly view water utilities as attractive targets due to the critical nature of services and potential for substantial ransom payments. Key groups targeting or capable of targeting water infrastructure include: **Qilin Ransomware** amassed over $50 million in ransom payments and specifically targets critical infrastructure. The group operates a sophisticated Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model and gained notoriety for the Synnovis attack that disrupted pathology services. **Akira Ransomware** maintains consistent activity with a focus on critical infrastructure, construction, and manufacturing—sectors that often interact with or depend on water systems. The group's retro 1980s aesthetic belies its professional operation and proven track record. [**Warlock Ransomware**](https://breached.company/warlock-ransomware-the-critical-infrastructure-threat-redefining-global-cybersecurity-in-2025/) represents a disturbing evolution: attributed to China-based threat actor Storm-2603, it blurs the lines between state-sponsored espionage and financially motivated cybercrime. Warlock has successfully breached major telecommunications providers and demonstrated capabilities for attacking critical infrastructure through exploitation of the \"ToolShell\" SharePoint vulnerabilities. **Everest Ransomware** recently [struck Sweden's national power grid operator](https://breached.company/svenska-kraftnat-breach-everest-ransomware-strikes-swedens-critical-power-infrastructure/), Svenska kraftnät, demonstrating that even well-defended national critical infrastructure remains vulnerable. ## Technical Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors Water infrastructure faces unique cybersecurity challenges stemming from legacy systems, limited budgets, and the intersection of IT and OT environments. ### Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) PLCs represent core technology components in industrial control systems and are a primary concern for critical infrastructure defenders. These devices control everything from pump operations to chemical dosing, yet often run on outdated firmware with minimal security protections. The Unitronics PLC vulnerabilities exploited by Iranian groups exemplify the risk: these devices were internet-accessible with default credentials, allowing attackers to remotely manipulate water pressure, flow rates, and treatment processes. In the Ireland incident, attackers successfully compromised a controller maintaining water pressure, demonstrating that even small-scale attacks can have real-world consequences. ### Network Segmentation Failures Proper segmentation between business IT systems and operational technology (OT) systems is critical for limiting the impact of cyber intrusions. However, many water utilities have poorly segmented networks that allow attackers who compromise IT systems to pivot to OT environments. The British National Cyber Security Centre specifically encourages critical infrastructure providers to ensure proper segmentation and released a new Cyber Assessments Framework in August 2024 to help organizations improve resilience. Don Smith, Vice President of Threat Research at Sophos, emphasized: \"Commodity rather than targeted attacks remain the most likely threat to impact critical infrastructure providers. The messaging I pass to CISOs and the people managing risk in these organizations is to worry about defending from the everyday as opposed to defending from the exotic.\" ### Supply Chain and Third-Party Risks [Supply chain vulnerabilities](https://breached.company/major-cyber-attacks-2025-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-the-years-most-devastating-data-breaches-and-ransomware-incidents/) represent an increasingly significant attack vector. Water utilities often rely on multiple vendors for monitoring, maintenance, and operational technology management. Compromising a single managed service provider can provide access to dozens of utilities simultaneously. The 2024-2025 period saw numerous high-profile supply chain attacks, including exploitation of Cleo managed file transfer vulnerabilities that compromised over 300 organizations globally. Similar attacks on platforms like Salesforce, exposed in [the ShinyHunters breach affecting 2.5 billion Gmail users](https://breached.company/summer-2025-cyber-attack-retrospective/), demonstrate how third-party platforms can become vectors for massive data exposure. ### Remote Access Vulnerabilities VPN concentrators and remote access systems without multi-factor authentication (MFA) provide straightforward initial access for threat actors. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated remote work adoption, including in operational technology environments, often without corresponding security improvements. Volt Typhoon actors specifically exploit publicly available vulnerabilities in network appliances from Fortinet, Ivanti, Netgear, Citrix, and Cisco to gain initial access. Once inside, they conduct extensive reconnaissance, steal credentials, and establish persistence using LOTL techniques that allow them to operate undetected for years. ## The U.S. Regulatory Struggle The United States has faced unique challenges in improving water sector cybersecurity, with efforts repeatedly stalling due to industry opposition and political interference. ### EPA Enforcement Efforts and Pushback In March 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency interpreted existing legal requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act to include mandatory cybersecurity assessments at drinking water systems. This initiative represented a significant step toward securing the nation's water infrastructure. However, the EPA withdrew this requirement just seven months later after facing aggressive legal challenges from water industry groups that partnered with Republican lawmakers to halt federal oversight efforts. The water industry argued that cybersecurity mandates represented federal overreach and would impose excessive costs on utilities. This occurred despite: - Significant increases in ransomware attacks on water systems - Growing evidence of state-sponsored intrusions - A U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report in August 2024 finding that EPA lacked a comprehensive national cybersecurity strategy for the water sector - EPA's own assessment showing over 70% non-compliance with existing safety requirements ### The CIRCIA Implementation The Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA), passed in 2022, aims to mandate that critical infrastructure entities report significant cyber incidents to CISA within 72 hours and ransomware payments within 24 hours. Final rules are expected in late 2025. American Water's October 2024 breach highlighted the importance of transparent incident reporting. The utility disclosed the attack via an SEC 8-K filing, both fulfilling its legal obligations as a publicly traded company and providing public notification. This transparency, while legally mandated, stands in contrast to the voluntary and often delayed reporting that characterizes much of the water sector. ### Federal Funding Challenges The MS-ISAC (Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center) detected and prevented more than 59,000 malware and ransomware attacks on local governments in 2024. However, federal funding cuts have forced the Center for Internet Security to temporarily self-fund these critical services at over $1 million per month. The American Rescue Plan Act provided $6.5 billion for water infrastructure projects, and EPA partnerships with states have facilitated approximately $200 billion in water improvement projects. Yet infrastructure funding is rarely dedicated specifically to information technology and cybersecurity upgrades, leaving utilities to prioritize regulatory compliance for water quality over cyber defenses. ## The Water Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2025 Recognizing the urgent need for action, bipartisan legislation has emerged to address water sector vulnerabilities. Senators Ruben Gallego and Tom Cotton introduced the Water Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2025, which aims to provide comprehensive support for water utilities. ### Key Provisions **Direct Grant Funding**: The legislation authorizes grants specifically for cybersecurity improvements at community water systems, particularly those serving populations of 3,300 or more already required to complete risk assessments under federal law. **Technical Assistance and Training**: Recognizing that many utilities lack dedicated cybersecurity personnel, the Act provides funding for staff training, incident response planning, and access to cybersecurity expertise. **Democratizing Resources**: The bill specifically targets smaller and rural utilities that have limited budgets and outdated infrastructure. These systems are disproportionately vulnerable due to lack of dedicated IT staff and insufficient security budgets. **Shift in Mindset**: Beyond funding, the legislation promotes a fundamental change in how water utilities approach cybersecurity—moving from reactive to proactive defense and recognizing cyber risk as a core operational concern rather than an optional IT enhancement. Senator Gallego stated: \"Adversaries understand the importance of secure access to water and are trying to undermine water security. It is critical that we ensure our public water systems have the resources they need to prevent and respond to cyberattacks.\" ## International Responses and Coordination While the U.S. struggles with regulatory implementation, other nations have moved more decisively. ### European Union Framework The EU has established a comprehensive regulatory framework for critical infrastructure security: **NIS2 Directive (EU/2022/2555)**: Establishes measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union, with specific provisions for essential services including water. **Critical Entities Resilience Directive (EU/2022/2557)**: Focuses on both physical and cyber resilience of critical infrastructure, requiring entities to conduct risk assessments and implement security measures. **EU Preparedness Union Strategy (March 2025)**: Aims to strengthen Europe's capability to prevent and respond to hybrid and cyber threats affecting critical infrastructure, including energy and water systems. ### Five Eyes Collaboration The Volt Typhoon advisories published by CISA, NSA, and FBI were co-signed by cybersecurity agencies in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, demonstrating unprecedented intelligence-sharing among Five Eyes nations regarding threats to critical infrastructure. This collaboration reflects recognition that water infrastructure security represents a shared challenge requiring coordinated international response. Anne Neuberger, Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies, emphasized the need for clarity distinguishing cyber espionage from pre-positioning for attacks, stating: \"We know it is not for espionage purposes, because when we look at the sectors like water sectors and civilian airport sectors, those have very little intelligence value.\" ### Switzerland and Global Trends Switzerland enacted a mandate requiring operators of critical infrastructure to report cyberattacks to national authorities, effective April 1, 2025. The country joins Australia, the EU, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, the UK, and the US in implementing similar reporting mandates. This global trend toward mandatory reporting reflects growing recognition that voluntary disclosure is insufficient for understanding and responding to the threat landscape. As documented in [our comprehensive analysis of 2025's cybersecurity landscape](https://breached.company/briefing-on-the-2025-cybersecurity-landscape-key-threats-trends-and-incidents/), attacks on energy, water, and transport sectors rose by 34% in 2025. ## Lessons from Successful Attacks While most cyberattacks on water infrastructure have not disrupted actual water supplies, several incidents provide critical lessons. ### The Ireland Case Study The December 2023 attack on a private group water scheme in County Mayo, Ireland, resulted in several days without water for residents in a remote area. Iranian-linked hackers indiscriminately targeted facilities using Unitronics equipment manufactured in Israel, successfully compromising an internet-connected controller that maintained water pressure. **Key Lessons**: - Internet-accessible OT devices without proper authentication represent critical vulnerabilities - Even small-scale attacks can have significant real-world consequences - Geographic targeting based on equipment origin demonstrates how geopolitical factors influence cyber operations - Remote and rural areas may be particularly vulnerable due to limited technical expertise ### The American Water Incident American Water's October 2024 breach affected the largest regulated water utility in the United States, serving 14 million people across 14 states and 18 military installations. While operations and water quality remained unaffected, the attack forced shutdown of customer billing systems and service portals. **Key Lessons**: - The intersection of IT and OT systems creates cascading vulnerabilities - Transparent incident disclosure, while challenging, maintains public trust - Large utilities with significant resources still struggle with sophisticated attacks - Billing and customer service systems, while not operational technology, remain high-value targets for attackers seeking to cause disruption and extract ransoms ### The Canadian Pressure Manipulation Recent incidents in Canada where hacktivists successfully changed water pressure at local utilities demonstrate that attacks directly affecting operational parameters are not merely theoretical threats but current realities. **Key Lessons**: - Direct OT manipulation is technically feasible and actively occurring - Hacktivist groups, not just nation-states and ransomware operators, possess capabilities to interfere with industrial control systems - Real-time monitoring and anomaly detection systems are essential for identifying unauthorized parameter changes - Incident response plans must account for physical safety implications of cyber incidents ## The Economic and Operational Challenge Securing water infrastructure faces fundamental economic challenges that complicate technical solutions. ### Budget Constraints Many water utilities operate as regulated monopolies with limited discretionary budgets. Rate increases to fund cybersecurity improvements require regulatory approval and can face political resistance from ratepayers. As noted by cybersecurity expert David Moore: \"The fundamental challenge here is economic. They can ask for rate hikes to fund it, but that can be politically challenging. It's often the case that the budget just isn't there.\" ### Competing Priorities Water systems must prioritize regulatory compliance for water quality and safety—requirements backed by stringent enforcement and potential legal liability. Cybersecurity, in contrast, has historically been voluntary or weakly enforced, creating an incentive structure that deprioritizes cyber investment. EPA's finding that 70% of water systems fail to comply even with existing risk assessment requirements suggests that voluntary frameworks are insufficient. Mandatory requirements with enforcement mechanisms appear necessary to drive meaningful security improvements. ### Skills Gap and Expertise Small and medium-sized water utilities often lack dedicated IT staff, let alone cybersecurity specialists. The skills required to secure industrial control systems differ significantly from traditional IT security, requiring understanding of both OT protocols and cyber defense. The Water Cybersecurity Enhancement Act's emphasis on training and technical assistance recognizes this skills gap as a fundamental barrier to improved security. Many utilities need external expertise to conduct vulnerability assessments, implement security controls, and develop incident response capabilities. ### Legacy Systems and Long Lifecycles Water infrastructure has extraordinarily long lifecycles—treatment plants and distribution systems may operate for 50-100 years. Control systems and monitoring equipment, while shorter-lived, still often remain in service for decades beyond their intended lifespan. This creates a fundamental mismatch: cybersecurity threats evolve on timescales measured in months or weeks, while infrastructure replacement occurs on timescales measured in decades. Retrofitting legacy systems with security controls is technically challenging and expensive, yet wholesale replacement is economically infeasible. ## Best Practices and Mitigation Strategies Despite these challenges, proven strategies can significantly improve water infrastructure security. ### Network Architecture **Segmentation**: Properly isolating business IT networks from operational technology environments limits the ability of attackers who compromise IT systems to pivot to OT. This requires both physical and logical separation, with strictly controlled communication pathways between environments. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Moving beyond perimeter-based security models to assume breach and verify all access attempts reduces the impact of compromised credentials. As detailed in [emerging threat analysis](https://breached.company/the-cybersecurity-battleground-september-2025s-most-critical-threats/), organizations are moving toward comprehensive Zero Trust architectures that assume breach and focus on limiting damage. **Network Visibility**: Comprehensive monitoring of both IT and OT environments enables detection of anomalous behavior. Many utilities lack basic visibility into what devices exist on their networks and how they communicate, making threat detection nearly impossible. ### Identity and Access Management **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Implementing phishing-resistant MFA on all remote access systems and critical administrative accounts substantially reduces the effectiveness of credential theft. **Privileged Access Management**: Strictly controlling administrative credentials, implementing just-in-time access, and monitoring privileged account activity helps detect and prevent lateral movement. **Regular Credential Rotation**: Changing default credentials on all devices, implementing strong password policies, and regularly rotating credentials reduces the window of opportunity for attackers using stolen credentials. ### Vulnerability Management **Patch Management**: Prioritizing patches for internet-facing systems and known vulnerabilities frequently exploited by threat groups like Volt Typhoon reduces attack surface. **Asset Inventory**: Maintaining comprehensive inventories of all IT and OT assets enables effective vulnerability management and ensures no systems are overlooked. **End-of-Life Planning**: Developing strategies for replacing or isolating technology beyond manufacturer support prevents vulnerable legacy systems from becoming entry points. ### Detection and Response **Logging and Monitoring**: Ensuring comprehensive logging is enabled for applications, access, and security events, with logs stored in centralized systems protected from tampering. **Incident Response Planning**: Developing, testing, and regularly updating incident response plans specific to water operations, including procedures for responding to both IT and OT incidents. **Tabletop Exercises**: Conducting regular exercises simulating various attack scenarios, including ransomware, OT manipulation, and nation-state intrusions. ### Commodity Threat Focus Don Smith's advice bears repeating: \"The much bigger risk is that we end up with a major piece of our CNI knocked offline because of a ransomware attack. I worry about people thinking about investing huge amounts in monitoring esoteric systems when they're actually not protecting themselves from the basics.\" While nation-state threats like Volt Typhoon require attention, the most likely threat remains commodity ransomware and opportunistic attacks exploiting basic security failures. Organizations must ensure they have strong foundational security before investing in advanced threat detection. ## The Path Forward Securing water infrastructure requires sustained effort across multiple fronts: regulatory reform, increased funding, technical improvements, and cultural change. ### Regulatory Evolution The UK's Cyber Security and Resilience Bill and the U.S. implementation of CIRCIA represent important steps toward mandatory incident reporting and security standards. However, regulations must be: - **Specific enough** to drive meaningful action while flexible enough to accommodate diverse utility sizes and capabilities - **Backed by enforcement** to ensure compliance rather than remaining voluntary guidelines - **Funded adequately** so that compliance costs don't force utilities to choose between safety and security ### Public-Private Partnership Effective water security requires collaboration between government agencies providing threat intelligence and technical assistance, utilities implementing security controls, and technology vendors building secure-by-design products. CISA's continued provision of cybersecurity services to critical infrastructure, despite budget pressures, demonstrates the importance of federal support. Expanding programs like the Cyber Hygiene Services to systematically scan and assess water utility networks could identify vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. ### International Cooperation Water infrastructure security represents a global challenge requiring continued intelligence sharing and coordinated responses. The Five Eyes collaboration on Volt Typhoon demonstrates the value of shared threat intelligence, but this model should expand to include more nations and cover additional threat actors. ### Investment and Innovation Securing water infrastructure ultimately requires sustained investment—in technology, people, and processes. This includes: - Modernizing legacy systems with security-by-design principles - Deploying advanced monitoring and detection capabilities - Training and retaining cybersecurity talent - Conducting regular security assessments and penetration testing The Water Cybersecurity Enhancement Act represents an important funding mechanism, but sustained investment will require creative approaches to utility financing and potentially new models for cybersecurity service delivery. ## Conclusion The five cyberattacks on British water suppliers since January 2024 exemplify a global trend that shows no signs of abating. Water infrastructure sits at the intersection of multiple threat vectors: nation-states seeking pre-positioned access for potential future conflict, ransomware groups targeting critical services for financial gain, and hacktivists demonstrating capabilities to manipulate operational parameters. As documented throughout [our ongoing coverage of critical infrastructure attacks](https://breached.company/the-10-most-recent-and-significant-cyber-attacks-and-data-breaches-worldwide-q1-2025/), the threat landscape continues to intensify. Weekly cyberattacks per organization increased 47% year-over-year in Q1 2025, with ransomware incidents surging 126%. Critical infrastructure—including water systems—remains a primary target. Yet there is reason for cautious optimism. The voluntary reporting of incidents by UK water suppliers, the bipartisan support for the Water Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, international coordination exemplified by Five Eyes intelligence sharing, and growing recognition of cyber risk at board and executive levels all suggest increasing awareness and commitment to action. The challenge is urgent but not insurmountable. By implementing proven security practices, modernizing vulnerable systems, investing in people and technology, and creating regulatory frameworks that mandate and fund security improvements, the water sector can transform from one of the most vulnerable critical infrastructure sectors to a model of resilience. The alternative—waiting until a major attack disrupts water supplies to tens of millions of people—is simply unacceptable. As FBI Director Christopher Wray warned regarding Volt Typhoon, this threat defines our generation. The time for action is now, before pre-positioned access becomes activated disruption and the theoretical becomes catastrophically real. **Related Reading:** - [Briefing on the 2025 Cybersecurity Landscape: Key Threats, Trends, and Incidents](https://breached.company/briefing-on-the-2025-cybersecurity-landscape-key-threats-trends-and-incidents/) - [The 10 Most Recent and Significant Cyber Attacks and Data Breaches Worldwide (Q1 2025)](https://breached.company/the-10-most-recent-and-significant-cyber-attacks-and-data-breaches-worldwide-q1-2025/) - [Warlock Ransomware: The Critical Infrastructure Threat Redefining Global Cybersecurity in 2025](https://breached.company/warlock-ransomware-the-critical-infrastructure-threat-redefining-global-cybersecurity-in-2025/) - [Svenska Kraftnät Breach: Everest Ransomware Strikes Sweden's Critical Power Infrastructure](https://breached.company/svenska-kraftnat-breach-everest-ransomware-strikes-swedens-critical-power-infrastructure/) - [Major Cyber Attacks 2025: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Year's Most Devastating Data Breaches and Ransomware Incidents](https://breached.company/major-cyber-attacks-2025-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-the-years-most-devastating-data-breaches-and-ransomware-incidents/) - [Ransomware Onslaught: Multiple Groups Post Fresh Victims on October 3, 2025](https://breached.company/ransomware-onslaught-multiple-groups-post-fresh-victims-on-october-3-2025/) - [The Cyber Siege: How Ransomware is Crippling America's Cities and Towns](https://breached.company/the-cyber-siege-how-ransomware-is-crippling-americas-cities-and-towns/) - [Summer of Siege: A Deep Dive into the Breaches, Attacks, and Ransomware of 2025](https://breached.company/summer-2025-cyber-attack-retrospective/) **Sources:** - Recorded Future News: \"Hackers are attacking Britain's drinking water suppliers\" - U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO): \"Critical Infrastructure Protection: EPA Urgently Needs a Strategy to Address Cybersecurity Risks to Water and Wastewater Systems\" - CISA: \"PRC State-Sponsored Actors Compromise and Maintain Persistent Access to U.S. Critical Infrastructure\" - EPA: \"Enforcement Alert: Drinking Water Systems to Address Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities\" - Smart Water Magazine: \"Water sector cybersecurity in 2024: high stakes and urgent responses\" - StateScoop: \"'Critical' cyber vulnerabilities found in many water utilities, warns EPA inspector general\" - IBM: \"Cyberattack on American Water: A warning to critical infrastructure\" ## Read more [**Coordinated Cyber Attacks Strike Multiple London Councils: What We Know** \\ \\ Breaking: Multiple London borough councils have been hit by what appears to be a coordinated cyber attack, raising serious questions about the security of shared IT infrastructure in local government.\\ The Cyber Siege: How Ransomware is Crippling America’s Cities and TownsThe summer of 2025 has proven to be one](https://breached.company/coordinated-cyber-attacks-strike-multiple-london-councils-what-we-know/)[**Hackers Strike US Ivy League Schools Already Under Political Pressure** \\ \\ A wave of sophisticated cyber attacks has targeted half of the Ivy League institutions, exposing sensitive donor and student data while universities face mounting political scrutiny\\ In what cybersecurity experts are calling an unprecedented assault on American higher education, four of the eight Ivy League universities have fallen victim to](https://breached.company/hackers-strike-us-ivy-league-schools-already-under-political-pressure/)[**The Crimson Collective: Inside the Alliance That Created Cybercrime's Most Dangerous Supergroup** \\ \\ Executive Summary\\ The emergence of Crimson Collective and its subsequent merger into the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters alliance represents a watershed moment in cybercrime evolution.

The two neighbouring countries share the world’s longest [unmarked land border](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/23/india-china-border-skirmishes/). They fought a full fledge war in 1962 and are engaged in sporadic skirmishes since then. Recent military incidents have come to the fore again after a relatively long period of quiet. Tensions have spiked, and in a more recent incident, [20 Indian soldiers](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53061476) were killed in a scuffle that broke out between the two sides, flaring the tension to an unprecedented level and risking a major escalation between the two regional powers. The conflict started when on May 5, a [clash](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/tense-india-china-standoff-himalayan-border-escalate-200527120501581.html) took place between the Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh area at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) due to Indian intrusion and patrolling in Chinese claimed border territory. Apparently these clashes stalked from contradictory assessments of the demarcation of border itself, but the intrusion did not remain limited to one time and point. On May 9, Indian soldiers repeated the same activity which was checked by the Chinese soldiers and both sides got engaged in yet another brawling contest. Extension of skirmishes to another two to three locations was followed by military buildup in order to gear up responses. The expansion of these brawls at multiple places indicate that Indian Army has been pushing China rather than trying to calm down the situation. [Modi’s meeting](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/india-china-face-off-pm-modi-meets-nsa-chiefs-of-service-staff) with his like-minded national security team earlier also indicated the seriousness of the situation. In response, Chinese foreign ministry also vowed to safeguard its territorial integrity at all costs. Both sides have had military level talks to reduce the tensions but have not been able to restore peace. Going back to [1988 Sino-Indian deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93India_relations), which fostered some kind of tranquility promoting economic linkages and activities; outstanding issue of border demarcation was left unresolved. [Statistically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_GDP_of_China) the two countries were near equals on the world stage at that time; however, material balance of power between the two countries has dramatically changed since then. India has been on a steady path of rising economy but on relative terms its growth has considerably declined. Currently both nations are also engaged in a security dilemma directly and indirectly both. India has always been aspiring to take a lead role in the region and occupy a singular dominant position and this quest was aptly bolstered and fueled by the US in the light of US Grand Strategy for the region. India has exercised unilateral [political influence](https://theasiadialogue.com/2018/03/06/india-and-the-mantle-of-regional-hegemon/) with most countries while exercising lopsided treaty relations; Pakistan and Afghanistan being exception to this. In the last seventy years, it has annexed Sikkim; carried out military interventions in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh and Bhutan; coerced them with threats of war; and [interfered](https://theasiadialogue.com/2018/03/06/india-and-the-mantle-of-regional-hegemon/) in their domestic affairs. Nepal has recently been [victimized](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2019/12/20/nepal-a-victim-of-legacy-of-british-colonial-times/) as Indian authorities have released a political map showing 35 kilometers of Nepalese area as part of India. Continuous and unprovoked violations of the cease fire at Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan also reflect pursuits to keep the borders volatile. The regional situation started to change in 2010s, when China grew in [economic power](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/31/decade-china-west-china-ascent) disturbing existent stalemate. China with its persistent progress has increased its footprint in South Asia with far more friendly relations based on inclusivity, equality and mutual interests unlike Indian coercive strategy. In the last decade, while economic linkages between India and China have grown exponentially, their [political and military relations](https://southasianvoices.org/maintaining-the-spirit-in-2020-reflecting-on-2019-india-china-relations/) have remained tense amidst China’s growing power affording it proportionate say in the regional affairs. The increasing influence has come with a cost of offending India. India’s [foreign policy goals](https://thediplomat.com/2016/12/indias-connect-central-asia-policy-2/) are centered on enhancing its economic and political influence in Asia and around the world. India has been seeking to expand its commerce and trade through India’s North-South Transport Corridor ( [INSTC](http://polarconnection.org/india-instc-nordic-arctic/)) connecting India to Russia, Central Asian countries, Baltic, Nordic and Arctic regions. As Belt and Road Initiative [(BRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) has been expanding with considerable gains for China, India views it as a threat to its endeavors. The US planned [exit from Afghanistan](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-time-us-troops-exit-afghanistan-undermining-agreement/story?id=70908619) is emerging as another challenge adding to India’s frustrations. US diminishing interest and influence in Afghanistan will directly affect India’s goal of regional hegemony. For US, ensuring pro-Indian government and sustained internal stability in Afghanistan are critical factors in cementing Indian influence in the region, which so far seems to be a distinct possibility despite India’s ongoing efforts. Modi’s domestic policies are also taking toll.Abrogation of [Article 370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revocation_of_the_special_status_of_Jammu_and_Kashmir) and [crackdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-28/india-s-kashmir-crackdown-is-damaging-its-image-overseas) along with burgeoning atrocities in Jammu and Kashmir, enactment of controversial Citizenship Act and unprecedented violence against minorities especially Muslims are clear manifestation of India’s Supremacist approach with roots in Hindutva. Failure to control and cover these atrocities has also added to the frustrations. India is in a denial mode to accept China’s power and is feeling threatened. Indians see Beijing’s “Belt and Road” initiative as an [encirclement campaign](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20180420_R45194_3d4bf676130e76924f5fea6d2e54d3a78e2200a9.pdf), given how determinedly China has been building its presence in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and other points along the Indian Ocean. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s [Act East policy](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trend-lines/24861/how-modi-is-broadening-the-range-and-scope-of-india-s-act-east-policy) and the increasing US emphasis on the Indo-Pacific has created a framework for better cooperation thus making India an energeticfriend at a time when many of America’s traditional allies are going [grey](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2019-06-11/great-demographics-comes-great-power). These actions of India are manifestation of its quest to counter Chinese influence using all possible means tacitly emboldened by US. While both countries have scaled up their military presence in the border region, any military confrontation is likely to bring devastation to the region as a whole. While new cold war is echoing, US desire to use India as countervailing power to China is also inspiring Modi in his quests. The Indian expansionist ambitions coupled with Modi’s self-induced internal strife may stretch India beyond its capacity. China has asked India to be careful not to include the [US factor](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1190096.shtml) in its handling of any problem in its relation with China. Accordingly, going forward, either India would have to recognize the new reality and accept an end of its regional domination; or, it would have to find a more [even-keel approach](https://theasiadialogue.com/2018/03/06/india-and-the-mantle-of-regional-hegemon/) in its bilateral relationship with Beijing to make the latter’s forays into the region unprofitable. India simultaneously is playing the upper hand in the occupied Kashmir by carrying out unabated atrocities and offensive military posturing along the LoC. Evermore than before, India itself is trying to create a two front war situation while world powers like US, EU, Middle East are already grappling with their domestic issues. Any conflagration between the three nuclear states in the region (China, India and Pakistan) is a doomsday scenario and has the potential to engulf the region beyond South Asia. Indian decision-making elite are badly suffering from narcissism and they exude an aura of idiosyncratic populism. Confusion is prevailing and any incorrect and incoherent decision would be detrimental once it is seen in the overall strategic equation punctuated with COVID-19, economic regression and an emerging new world order. India needs to open her eyes to evade the pitfall before it is too late. Pakistan and China must play their role in a sagacious and pragmatic manner while ensuring safety and security of their nations and region alike. - [Asia](https://strafasia.com/tag/asia/) - [China](https://strafasia.com/tag/china/) - [India](https://strafasia.com/tag/india/) - [indo-china](https://strafasia.com/tag/indo-china/) - [nuclear](https://strafasia.com/tag/nuclear/) - [Strafasia](https://strafasia.com/tag/strafasia/) About Fida Hussain Malik [2 Articles](https://strafasia.com/author/fidahussainmalik/) Fida Hussain Malik who is a Islamabad based defense analyst and an author of several books on diverse topics. ### Related Articles Analysis ### [The Other Side of the Nuclear Coin](https://strafasia.com/the-other-side-of-the-nuclear-coin/) [27th May 2020](https://strafasia.com/2020/05/)[Zeeshan Hayat](https://strafasia.com/author/zeeshanhayat/)[Analysis](https://strafasia.com/category/analysis/), [Environment](https://strafasia.com/category/environment/), [Nuclear](https://strafasia.com/category/security/nuclear/), [Politics](https://strafasia.com/category/politics/), [Security](https://strafasia.com/category/security/)[1](https://strafasia.com/the-other-side-of-the-nuclear-coin/#comments) [Print PDF](https://strafasia.com/strafasia.com) Print PDF The advent of fission in 1938 – a process in which an atom, bombarded with neutron is split into two or more parts with the release of a large amount of energy – [\\[…\\]](https://strafasia.com/the-other-side-of-the-nuclear-coin/) Analysis ### [Nuclear Deterrence and Stability in South Asia: Perceptions and Realities](https://strafasia.com/nuclear-deterrence-and-stability-in-south-asia-perceptions-and-realities/) [26th August 2021](https://strafasia.com/2021/08/)[Mahvish Malik](https://strafasia.com/author/mahvishmalik/)[Analysis](https://strafasia.com/category/analysis/), [Economy](https://strafasia.com/category/economy/), [Emerging Technologies](https://strafasia.com/category/security/emerging-technologies/), [Military](https://strafasia.com/category/security/military/), [Missiles](https://strafasia.com/category/security/missiles/), [Nuclear](https://strafasia.com/category/security/nuclear/), [Politics](https://strafasia.com/category/politics/), [Security](https://strafasia.com/category/security/), [Technology](https://strafasia.com/category/technology/)[0](https://strafasia.com/nuclear-deterrence-and-stability-in-south-asia-perceptions-and-realities/#respond) [Print PDF](https://strafasia.com/strafasia.com) Print PDF Pakistani and Indian nuclear capabilities are the key pillars for ensuring peace and security in the region – duly acknowledged by the two states in 2004.

The two main actors that constitute the best hope for global growth are obviously India and China. Of the two, India is in many ways the better bet. The country’s ‘bottom-up’ economic model (enabling it to better withstand systemic shocks), its demographic composition and its democratic system provide it with a future outlook that is brighter than China’s. Also, it is impressive that, despite endemic corruption, poor infrastructure, and a currently weak and directionless Congress Party-dominated government, India’s economy maintains a growth rate of 6%. Moving into an era of multipolarity, the importance of enhancing ties with a rising power like India is of great strategic importance for the West. At the same time, though, India is facing internal security pressures, albeit largely unknown to many investors and policy makers. Large swaths of Indian territory are plagued by conflict between the state and the long-running Maoist insurgency group known as the Naxalites. If not dealt with effectively, the Naxalites might prove to be too much for New Delhi and turn out to be India’s Achilles heel imperiling its phenomenal global rise. The current manifestation of Maoist-inspired violence in India can be traced back to the period immediately following the country’s independence in 1948. The term Naxal or Naxalite is derived from the Indian village of Naxalbari (West Bengal) where the movement has its roots. The stated goal of the Naxalites was, and remains to this day, to free the poor from the clutches of the landlords, to implement land reforms and destroy the oppressive feudal order in India. A central part their strategy to achieve this goal has been a guerrilla war against government forces in the underdeveloped rural and tribal regions of India. Although the nature of the movement makes it difficult to estimate the group’s size, recent estimates by The Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence service, have placed the numerical strength of the Naxalites at some 20,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. These numbers would suggest that the Naxalites are almost twice as big as the FARC movement in Columbia, which numbered around 11,000 operatives in 2009. The Naxalites’ organizational structure includes an elaborate hierarchy with a Central Committee at the top, followed by Regional Bureaus, Zonal or State Committees, and District or Division Committees. Following a period of internal strife and fractional splits, in 2004 the a merger occurred to create an umbrella organizational structure for the Naxalite insurgency. This reunification was followed by an upswing in the level of violence. Like all successful or enduring insurgent groups, the Naxalites follow a two-tiered strategy, using violence against their opponents as well as engaging in socio-economic initiatives to win the support of the population. With regard to the latter, it is important to note that the Naxalite insurgency puts much effort into addressing the grievances of the marginalised poor, who are disappointed in – or even hostile towards – the Indian government. For instance, Naxalite fighters have campaigned for women’s rights, have tried to improve the housing situation of those in need, have organised railway strikes, and have run irrigation projects to help farmers increase their harvests. The violent actions that make up the other second pillar of he Naxalite strategy are mostly aimed against the police, Indian government officials and transnational corporations. These attacks are intended to shield the population from capitalist influence. The Naxalites are quite successful in this regard, as the group has managed to take control of certain regions, especially in the Red Corridor, where state power has been eroded or has collapsed altogether. Several factors account for the Naxalites’ ability to pull off tours de force of this kind. First, the manpower that the Indian insurgents brings to bear, gives them the organisational clout needed to wage a large-scale campaign. Second, although the Naxalites are geographically dispersed and not centrally led, the group shows a remarkable commitment to the overall strategy. Although the group’s operatives occasionally lash out at the local population, Naxalite actions generally fit the ambition to create Naxalite-controlled areas to encircle the cities and eventually take over the country. The third explanation of the insurgency’s sustainability is the fact that many Naxalite operatives are active in their native areas. From this, they derive knowledge of the terrain, crucial in irregular warfare, as well as familiarity with the local population and its plight, which makes it unlikely that they will be perceived as interlopers. Another factor that makes it unlikely that the Naxalite insurgency will soon be a thing of the past is the inadequacy of the Indian government’s response. While it is clear that discrimination and poverty of the rural population provide the Naxalites with a support base and a pool of potential recruits, the government’s measures to alleviate the living conditions of the rural poor are generally half-hearted and poorly implemented. Rather, the government tries to quell the insurgency by taking a hard approach with a central role for law enforcement agencies. Thus far however, this hard line has not yielded the desired results. The number of police forces deployed against the Naxalites was recently increased to 76,000, but the insurgency is still alive and kicking. And even regardless of the effectiveness of the government line, it remains to be seen whether it is sustainable. India is one of the most underpoliced countries in the world, and there is little chance that the government will deploy the army, reluctant as it is to start a long and messy campaign and to take forces away from Jammu and Kashmir. It appears that the Naxalites are here to stay. All too often, analyses of India are based on the assumption that its rise is inevitable and effortless. For a long time, the western view was that the rest of the world held little allure to the west, but now, the received wisdom on India at business and international relations conferences is an overcompensation of earlier neglect and underestimation. This overly sunny view is as misguided as the prior arrogance. What is needed is a sober analysis of India’s economy and internal security situation. The goal of this article has certainly not been to denigrate the future potential of India or to engage in fear mongering. Rather, we have tried to draw attention to an important actor on the Indian scene that until now has received only minimal international attention. Adding this dimension to current thinking about India will allow investors and policy makers to make informed decisions on when, how and where to invest their money in India. If India is serious about defeating the Naxalites, they will need to deal with the root causes of the group’s appeal in the Red Corridor, which will require addressing poverty, corruption and tribal inclusion issues. Only by doing so can India retain the domestic stability that is a prerequisite for its continued phenomenal rise. ### About The Author ## Article Discussion: ![Small Wars Journal by Arizona State University](https://smallwarsjournal.com/wp-content/themes/swj/images/logo_icon.svg) ### Become a Member To Engage!

    "full_text": "# US–China Cyber Relations and the Weaponisation of Microsoft Platforms - November 11, 2025 \\| - [Issue Brief](https://www.idsa.in/publication-type/issuebrief) ## **_Summary_** _Cyber tensions between the United States and China show Microsoft’s central yet fragile role in global cybersecurity, where its platforms serve as both assets and targets. While both nations have exploited vulnerabilities within the platform to conduct cyber-espionage against each other, China has been particularly persistent in its operations._ ## **Introduction** Accusations of state-sponsored cyber espionage have come to define the cyber relations between the US and China over the years. The widespread adoption of Microsoft products has also made them prime targets for state-sponsored cyber espionage. High-profile incidents, such as the SolarWinds breach and attacks on Microsoft 365, have demonstrated how nation-state actors exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s ecosystem to conduct sophisticated espionage operations. The same tactics have been deployed by both the US and China, deepening mistrust and diplomatic friction between the two. [\\[1\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn1) In recent years, China, in particular, has increasingly weaponised vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s platforms to execute espionage and influence operations.\\ ## **Historical Overview of US–China Cyber Relations** The trajectory of US–China cyber relations reflect a history of mutual espionage, strategic mistrust and technological competition. Since China’s formal entry into the global Internet in 1994, cyberspace has emerged as a critical domain of tensions between the two powers. [\\[2\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn2) What began as isolated intrusions has expanded into a repeated cycle of cyber espionage, countermeasures and retaliatory diplomacy. Though both China and the US have used cyberspace to gain strategic, economic and military advantages, China’s campaigns, particularly those exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft systems, have been more frequent and globally disruptive. For more than a decade, China-based advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have launched cyber espionage campaigns targeting US government agencies, critical infrastructure, defence contractors and technology firms. For example, the 2005 Titan Rain cyber-attacks, which compromised the unclassified networks of the US Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Energy, stand out as an essential incident. [\\[3\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn3) Titan Rain represented the first publicly disclosed case of state-sponsored cyber espionage originating from China, and marked the first instance in which the US government publicly attributed such activities to Chinese state actors. Another prominent example is the 2009 Operation Aurora, a series of cyberattacks that compromised the networks of Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, and other high-profile companies to steal their trade secrets. [\\[4\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn4) This prompted Google to close its offices and operations in China. The China threat became so evident that, in 2011, the US government’s Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive issued a report naming China as the “most active and persistent” perpetrator of cyber intrusions into the United States. [\\[5\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn5) However, the US has not been passive in cyberspace—it has also conducted numerous cyber operations against Chinese networks and institutions. American intelligence, especially the National Security Agency (NSA), has used cyberspace for a long time to monitor and penetrate strategically. China has consistently claimed that the US is a leading perpetrator of cyberattacks and alleges tens of thousands of intrusions every year on Chinese systems. [\\[6\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn6) In fact, independent research supports the view that a significant volume of global cyber activity originates from or transits through the US-based infrastructure, facilitated by major American Internet service providers. Microsoft’s dominance in both public and private sectors made its software a primary target for advanced persistent threats. As the world’s largest provider of enterprise software, cloud infrastructure and productivity tools, Microsoft products such as Exchange, SharePoint, and Outlook underpin critical operations for governments, corporations and NGOs worldwide. This makes Microsoft a prime target for state and non-state actors seeking to penetrate sensitive networks, conduct cyber-espionage, or carry out disruptive attacks. The historical evolution serves as an essential reference point for better understanding the present stage of US–China cyber competition, in which Microsoft has become both the _battleground_ and the _barometer_ of their technological and strategic contest. The following cases illustrate how China, in particular, has weaponised Microsoft’s ecosystem. The three contemporary cases involving Hafnium, Antique Typhoon, and the combined efforts of Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm 2603 highlight a clear pattern that has been unfolding for years. They show how China’s cyber espionage tactics have not only increased but also grown more advanced and precise over time. These recent cases also highlight a transition from broad, data-theft-oriented attacks of the past to exact, zero-day-driven operations. ## **Chinese Cyber Operations Targeting the US via Microsoft Platforms** Serving as a critical gateway to US government, corporate and institutional networks, Microsoft offers Chinese actors a high-value “window” for espionage and economic theft. Because its tools are so widely adopted, and because many of them manage privileged access, hold private keys, or broker identity/trust, vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s systems are highly attractive. An exploit can give adversaries far-reaching potential: infiltrate multiple organisations simultaneously, move laterally within networks, exfiltrate intellectual property, observe or manipulate decision-makers, or launch ransomware. Chinese threat groups have repeatedly exploited these weaknesses, as evidenced in the cases discussed below. The following sections discuss key instances of Chinese cyber operations targeting Microsoft, intended to gather intelligence and advance strategic interests against the United States. Table 1 outlines the attack timeline, the identified Chinese threat actor, the attack target, the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used, the attack objective, and Microsoft’s corresponding patching or mitigation measures. ## **_2021 Hafnium Cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange Servers_** Hafnium, a threat group believed to be state-sponsored and operating in China, launched several cyberattacks on Microsoft Exchange Servers in January 2021. The attack exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855, 26857, 26858 and 27065). [\\[7\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn7) By February, the incident had escalated into one of the most significant cyber incidents in recent history: approximately a quarter of a million systems worldwide were exposed, predominantly small and medium-sized businesses and organisations, with at least 30,000 confirmed compromises. What initially appeared to be targeted espionage quickly transformed into a widespread “smash-and-grab” operation. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Centre attributed the attack to a Chinese state-sponsored actor based on observed tactics and procedures. [\\[8\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn8) The Biden administration later publicly accused China, attributing the operation to cyber actors connected to the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and stated that it had exploited zero-day vulnerabilities that Microsoft subsequently patched in March. China, however, firmly rejected these allegations. Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responded to the US-led accusations by stating that the United States, along with its allies, has fabricated allegations against China regarding cybersecurity, with no factual basis. [\\[9\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn9) Hafnium is known to target entities in the US across various industry sectors, including law firms, infectious disease researchers, higher education institutions, policy think tanks, defence contractors and NGOs, reflecting a broad, strategic focus on intelligence collection. ## **_2023 Antique Typhoon Breaching Email Accounts Incident_** In May 2023, Antique Typhoon, a Chinese state-backed threat actor previously tracked by Microsoft as _Storm-0558_, carried out a cyber intrusion that compromised email accounts at roughly two dozen organisations across the United States and Europe, including the US Department of Commerce. Among those targeted were Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and several members of the House of Representatives. [\\[10\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn10) China firmly denied the allegations, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs accusing the US of engaging in its own hacking activities and labelling the Microsoft report as “highly unprofessional” and “disinformation”. Active since at least August 2021, Storm-0558 is a cyber-espionage group linked to China that specialises in stealing credentials through phishing, manipulating OAuth tokens and forging authentication credentials to infiltrate the email systems of targeted organisations. [\\[11\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn11) The group primarily targets government institutions in the United States and Europe, with a strategic focus on entities and individuals involved in geopolitical matters related to Taiwan and Uyghur interests. ## **_2025 Microsoft SharePoint Exploitation by Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm 2603_** In a recent cyberattack, three threat groups, suspected to be Chinese government-affiliated, exploited zero-day vulnerabilities to target Microsoft SharePoint servers. [\\[12\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn12) Several organisations across sectors, including government, critical infrastructure and education, have been impacted in countries such as the United States, Germany and Australia. The US National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) was among the organisations breached. However, reports suggest that no sensitive or classified information has been compromised. The identified threat groups include Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon and Storm-2603. Typhoon is a term Microsoft uses to designate Chinese nation-state threat groups, while Storm is a term it uses to refer to threat groups in development. China rejected the allegations, with Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the US, emphasising that cyberattacks are a global challenge that affects all countries, and that China is also a target of such threats. [\\[13\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn13) He reiterated the nation’s “consistent and clear” stance, underscoring that China firmly opposes all forms of cyberattacks and actively combats cybercrime. Linen Typhoon, active since 2012, primarily targets government, defence, strategic and human rights organisations to steal intellectual property, according to Microsoft. [\\[14\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn14) Violet Typhoon, identified in 2015, conducts espionage against former officials, NGOs, think tanks, universities, media and sectors like finance and healthcare across the US, Europe and East Asia. Meanwhile, Storm-2603, another China-based actor, has been observed trying to steal MachineKeys from compromised SharePoint servers. While much of the focus has been on China’s offensive cyber operations, it is essential to recognise that exploitation of Microsoft systems is not one-sided—the US has also exploited Microsoft as a platform to target China to steal intelligence and conduct cyber espionage. However, such instances have been less direct and less frequent. For example, the Vault 7 CIA leak exposed how the CIA developed and deployed malware, backdoors and custom hacking tools to compromise operating systems like Microsoft Windows to penetrate computers and networks used by foreign targets, including Chinese government agencies and commercial entities. [\\[15\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn15) However, Vault 7 was not specifically directed at China; it revealed cyber tools and operations targeting multiple regions, including Europe, the Middle East and China. In a recent development, China’s 2025 accusation against the US alleged that American agencies exploited unpatched Microsoft security flaws to spy on Chinese military networks, reflecting ongoing tit-for-tat cyber operations. [\\[16\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn16) Unlike the Chinese cases, where detailed objectives, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of Microsoft exploitation have been documented, the 2025 Microsoft bug incident has not been confirmed or detailed by either Microsoft or the US government. This shows that Chinese operations are explicitly oriented towards espionage against Western entities, particularly the US, highlighting the asymmetry in targeting focus between US and Chinese cyber activities involving Microsoft vulnerabilities. ## **Cyber Crisis Management** The repeated cycles of accusation and denial following these Microsoft-related breaches reveal a deeper structural problem in US–China cyber relations: the absence of effective cyber crisis management frameworks. While cyber operations have become increasingly sophisticated, mechanisms to contain their diplomatic fallout remain underdeveloped. Crisis management in cyberspace involves controlling and mitigating cyber incidents that can escalate into tensions between countries, armed conflict, or war. The objective is to prevent cyberspace confrontations from escalating into a full-fledged war. Though disputes in cyberspace are low-intensity and involve limited confrontation, the need for cyber crisis stems from the recent rise in full-scale confrontation triggered by cyberspace conflicts between countries. [\\[17\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn17) One of the most critical objectives of crisis management is the establishment of shared attribution protocols and norms. [\\[18\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn18) Joint technical teams should develop transparent, mutually-agreed processes for attributing attacks and reducing the “who-did-it” ambiguity that fuels retaliation. Attribution has, in fact, proved to be a significant challenge in US–China cyber crisis management. China’s increasing sophistication of cyber threat actors over the years has made it difficult to attribute specific attacks to specific actors. This uncertainty makes it difficult for governments to respond to or diplomatically address the situation quickly. Clear communication channels for de-escalating cyber crises are essential for cyber crisis management in the US–China context. [\\[19\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn19) Historically, the absence of direct lines of dialogue during cyber incidents has frequently led to misunderstandings and tensions. Bilateral dialogue mechanisms have also seen limited success. For instance, the US–China Cyber Agreement in 2015 did not fully succeed in reducing the number of cyberattacks, especially in the long term. US cybersecurity experts observed a sudden decline in Chinese cyberattacks after the 2015 agreement. However, they assigned four possible reasons for this decline—the first is the advancement in carrying out sophisticated cyberattacks which are challenging to be detected in cyberspace; second could be China’s use of proxies in other countries to target victims in the US; third could be China’s redirecting of attacks to other countries; and fourth could be that the agreement actually helped in putting a stop in Chinese cyberattacks by conducting an anti-corruption campaign in the government and PLA after signing the contract. Similarly, the US–China Cyber Working Group saw limited success mainly due to mutual mistrust and differing national interests. These past bilateral efforts to institutionalise dialogue, such as the 2015 US–China Cyber Agreement and the US–China Cyber Working Group, demonstrate both the potential and the fragility of cyber crisis management. When formal diplomatic channels fail during periods of tension, academic and civil exchanges play a crucial role in sustaining dialogue. Platforms such as the China–US Internet Forum (2007) and the Cyber Security Track-2 Dialogue (2009) have been successful in building mutual understanding and easing mistrust. Promoting collaborative research among think tanks and scholars enables both sides to address contentious issues more constructively, identify feasible policy recommendations and rebuild confidence. Such exchanges could further help revitalise past cooperative efforts, such as the 2015 six-point cybersecurity consensus, and align bilateral efforts with broader international norms developed by the UN Group of Governmental Experts. ## **Microsoft’s Role in Cyber Crisis Management** Given how deeply Microsoft’s systems are embedded in government and private networks worldwide, its ability to anticipate and respond to large-scale cyber incidents has become a key concern for global security. Microsoft has built a fairly comprehensive system for managing cyber crises. This includes monitoring potential threats, coordinating incident response teams, public disclosure practices, and the regular release of intelligence through reports such as the Annual Digital Defence Report and Cyber Signals. In the aftermath of major incidents such as the Hafnium and Antique Typhoon attacks, Microsoft demonstrated a structured, transparent approach to crisis management. The company’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Digital Security Unit (DSU) usually take the lead, identifying attackers, issuing emergency patches, and working closely with cybersecurity bodies such as the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Microsoft also engages in attribution-based reporting. The company often names the threat actors involved (in cases such as Hafnium or Storm-0558) and explains the tactics and tools they used. This kind of transparency has two significant benefits: it improves global understanding of emerging threats and deters repeated attacks by exposing the methods behind them. However, not everyone views this positively. Governments such as China’s have criticised Microsoft’s attributions, calling them politically biased or insufficiently backed by evidence. Central to Microsoft’s broader preparedness strategy is its Annual Digital Defense Reports (DDRs). These reports compile insights from an enormous amount of data: over 65 trillion security signals processed daily across Microsoft’s cloud network. While they offer a look back at global cyber trends, they also serve as forward-looking tools to help governments and organisations evaluate their resilience against new forms of attack. The 2023 report, for example, highlighted the increasing sophistication of state-sponsored hackers, particularly those from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. [\\[20\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn20) It showed how these actors are shifting towards more covert tactics, such as credential theft and supply chain infiltration. Microsoft’s quarterly _Cyber Signals_ reports build on this work, offering more targeted insights by region and sector, effectively bridging technical threat analysis and high-level policy guidance. Despite its active role in crisis management, Microsoft continues to face criticism over its complex position in the cyber landscape. [\\[21\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn21) It often finds itself both as a primary target of attacks and as a major player in defending against them. This dual role raises a bigger issue: the world’s growing dependence on a single company’s digital infrastructure. When Microsoft is breached, the impact spreads far beyond its own systems. The ongoing US–China cyber rivalry has repeatedly exposed this vulnerability. While Microsoft’s rapid crisis response and transparency help strengthen global resilience, they also reveal how much modern cybersecurity—and, by extension, national security—depends on a single corporate actor. In that sense, Microsoft’s threat assessments and crisis responses have evolved into more than just technical exercises—they now play a part in shaping the global balance of power in cyberspace. ## **Conclusion** The evolution of China’s cyber operations against the United States highlights how cyberspace has become an increasingly contested frontier in great-power rivalry. From Titan Rain and Operation Aurora to Hafnium and Antique Typhoon, the pattern reveals a steady progression from rudimentary data theft to highly sophisticated campaigns that exploit global digital interdependence. Microsoft’s platforms, which anchor both US government and private infrastructure, have emerged as critical battlegrounds in this struggle, reflecting not only their technological ubiquity but also their geopolitical importance. While the US continues to accuse China of state-sponsored cyber espionage and intellectual property theft, China maintains that it too is a victim of cyberattacks, deflecting blame and challenging the credibility of US narratives. This dynamic has created a persistent cycle of accusation and denial, deepening mistrust between the two powers. The cyber contest between the US and China ultimately reflects the broader struggle for influence in the 21st century global order. The Microsoft incidents serve as a reminder that technological dependence can become both a strength and a vulnerability. Unless both sides commit to developing trust-based frameworks and credible deterrence mechanisms, the current trajectory of cyber confrontation could continue to erode international stability and the very foundations of digital cooperation that underpin modern global life.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively.

Ashley, ‘How the Spectre of Hindutva Captured Politics in Kerala,’ The Wire, 30 October 2020](https://thewire.in/politics/kerala-elections-hindutva-muslims) The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

The threat group, active since at least 2013, has targeted organizations in Pakistan, China, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia. More recently, the group used spearphishing emails to victimize high-profile officials at a Turkish defense organization and deployed remote access Trojans into its systems to exfiltrate sensitive data (see: [_Espionage Campaign Targets Turkish Defense Industry_](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/espionage-campaign-targets-turkish-defense-industry-a-27085)). The group in its emails used a decoy PDF document detailing public infrastructure projects in Madagascar as bait to entice victims into downloading malicious RAR files that used PowerShell to deploy remote access tools. \"This subject line theme is very common for TA397, as the majority of the organizations they target are either in the public sector or receive public investments and is indicative of the targeted nature of their campaigns,\" cybersecurity company Proofpoint said. According to researchers at Cyfirma, TA397 primarily uses two remote access Trojans - the legacy WmRAT that gathers system data and exfiltrates files and a newer, more sophisticated tool called MiyaRAT, written in C++, that performs similar tasks but packs advanced encryption and reverse shell capabilities. Proofpoint, which discovered the espionage campaign, [said](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/hidden-plain-sight-ta397s-new-attack-chain-delivers-espionage-rats) TA397 possibly reserves the use of MiyaRAT for targets that it deems \"high value due to the observed sporadic deployment of the malware in only a certain number of campaigns.\" Security researchers have observed that aside from the two remote access tools, TA397 actors have also deployed cross-platform malware in the past to spy on specific targets. According to BlackBerry researchers, the threat group [used](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2019/10/mobile-malware-and-apt-espionage-prolific-pervasive-and-cross-platform) mobile malware in an espionage campaign, dubbed Operation Dualpak, targeting the Pakistani government in the summer of 2019. The group during that campaign distributed fake applications that mimicked known entities like Pornhub Premium and the UK-based Ansar Foundation, through SMS, WhatsApp and various social media platforms to eventually drop mobile malware called PWNDROID2 into compromised devices. Once a device is infected, TA397 establishes scheduled tasks to maintain persistence and enable communication with the command-and-control server, and exploits known vulnerabilities to execute malicious code, conduct privilege escalation or to deliver malware. The cybercrime group has in recent years exploited high-profile vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2018-0802, a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office; CVE-2017-11882, a Microsoft Office memory corruption vulnerability; and CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065 that are remote code execution vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Exchange Server. Cisco Talos [said](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/bitter-apt-adds-bangladesh-to-their/) in 2022 that TA397 ran an espionage campaign since August 2021 targeting high-ranking officials of the Rapid Action Battalion Unit of the Bangladesh police to gain access to details of their regular operations. The group's spearphishing emails contained malicious RTF documents weaponized to exploit all known vulnerabilities in Microsoft products. When a target downloaded a malicious RTF or Microsoft Excel file, the group downloaded a Trojan from the hosting server that masqueraded as a Windows Security update service and enabled attackers to execute remote code to download additional malware. Security researchers at Kaspersky also [found](https://securelist.com/zero-day-vulnerability-in-desktop-window-manager-cve-2021-28310-used-in-the-wild/101898/) TA397 actors exploiting CVE-2021-28310, an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in dwmcore.dll, which is part of Desktop Window Manager. The vulnerability was then deemed as a zero-day, indicating that the group had the resources to identify vulnerabilities in well-known software that had not been previously exploited. - [Cyberwarfare / Nation-State Attacks](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/cyberwarfare-nation-state-attacks-c-420) - [Fraud Management & Cybercrime](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/fraud-management-cybercrime-c-409) - [Geo Focus: Asia](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/geo-focus-asia-c-521) - [Geo-Specific](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/geo-specific-c-518) - [Government](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/government-c-524) - [Industry Specific](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/industry-specific-c-515) - [Next-Generation Technologies & Secure Development](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/next-generation-technologies-secure-development-c-467) - [Threat Intelligence](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/threat-intelligence-c-476) - [Credit Eligible](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/premium/pricing) - Get Permission [PreviousChainalysis Expands Fraud Detection With Alterya Acquisition](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/chainalysis-expands-fraud-detection-alterya-acquisition-a-27272) [Next Report: Chinese Hackers Breached CFIUS](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/report-chinese-hackers-breached-cfius-a-27274) #### About the Author #### [Jayant Chakravarti](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/authors/jayant-chakravarti-i-5635) _Senior Editor, APAC_ Chakravarti covers cybersecurity developments in the Asia-Pacific region.

On Nov. 11, a suicide bombing killed at least 12 people and injured 36 outside the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. While the Afghanistan-based Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group denied responsibility, a hard-line TTP faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), subsequently claimed the attack and said it targeted \"the judges, lawyers, and other staff who enforce Pakistan's un-Islamic laws.\" Pakistani authorities are still investigating \"all aspects\" of the bombing, though some top officials have suggested it occurred with Indian support, with Pakistan's prime minister attributing the attack to India-backed militants, and the country's interior minister claiming \"Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" were... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. ## Document Type Book ## Publication Date 10-2016 ## Publisher National Defense University Press ## City Washington, DC ## Recommended Citation Lynch, Thomas F.

Ajit Doval’s Office Probes Digital Breach at Indira Gandhi Airport SHARE **NEW DELHI:** A suspected GPS spoofing attack that crippled flight operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport has prompted an investigation by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval’s office. The incident, which briefly grounded major domestic and international carriers, has reignited concerns about India’s aviation safety systems—already flagged by a recent parliamentary committee report as “lagging behind global standards.” Contents [A National Security Probe into the Heart of India’s Aviation System](https://the420.in/the420.in#a-national-security-probe-into-the-heart-of-indias-aviation-system) [Automation Under Stress: The AMSS Breakdown](https://the420.in/the420.in#automation-under-stress-the-amss-breakdown) [Warnings Ignored: A Parliamentary Report’s Stark Findings](https://the420.in/the420.in#warnings-ignored-a-parliamentary-reports-stark-findings) [Global Standards, Local Gaps](https://the420.in/the420.in#global-standards-local-gaps) ### **A National Security Probe into the Heart of India’s Aviation System** The Office of the National Security Advisor (NSA), led by Ajit Doval, has launched a high-level probe into a suspected GPS spoofing attack that disrupted flight operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport earlier this week. Officials confirmed that the anomaly, which crippled communication and navigation systems under the Airport Management Support System (AMSS), temporarily brought flight movements to a halt. The disruption, which lasted several hours, affected major domestic carriers such as IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet, and Akasa Air, alongside international airlines including British Airways and Lufthansa. While the issue was resolved within a day, it exposed a critical fault line in India’s aviation security infrastructure—an area increasingly vulnerable to both cyber and technical threats. > [“Centre for Police Technology” Launched as Common Platform for Police, OEMs, and Vendors to Drive Smart Policing](https://the420.in/centre-for-police-technology-launched-as-common-platform-for-police-oems-and-vendors-to-drive-smart-policing/) ### **Automation Under Stress: The AMSS Breakdown** Preliminary findings indicate that the malfunction stemmed from interference in the automated systems managing air traffic coordination and GPS tracking. The AMSS, a core backbone of modern airport operations, synchronizes navigation data, weather inputs, and flight management software. A disruption—whether caused by a cyberattack or a system overload—can cascade rapidly through radar, communication, and control networks. For passengers, the incident translated into chaos on the ground: delayed departures, missed connections, and a sudden breakdown in real-time flight data visibility. For aviation authorities, it underscored a deeper challenge—the growing strain on India’s automation systems as air traffic surges to pre-pandemic highs. ### **Warnings Ignored: A Parliamentary Report’s Stark Findings** The crisis came barely two months after a parliamentary committee issued a prescient warning about “performance degradation” in India’s aviation automation systems. The 380th report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism, and Culture—tabled on August 20—had flagged slowness, lag, and system inefficiencies at major airports, including Delhi and Mumbai. The committee cautioned that these technical limitations, coupled with outdated air traffic control (ATC) infrastructure, could jeopardize flight safety. It further highlighted chronic staff shortages, rising controller fatigue, and the slow pace of modernization—factors that have collectively pushed India’s aviation systems behind global benchmarks. ### **Global Standards, Local Gaps** India’s aviation sector, one of the fastest-growing in the world, has struggled to align its safety architecture with international standards. While the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has accelerated modernization programs under its Air Navigation Services Roadmap, experts warn that digital vulnerabilities—especially cyber interference like GPS spoofing—represent a new frontier of risk. The Delhi incident, now under the NSA’s scrutiny, marks a critical juncture. It is no longer only about technical resilience but also about national security preparedness in a digital era where the skies are as much about networks as they are about airways.

    "full_text": "Though both sides likely want to avoid full-blown conflict, India's strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir will very likely prompt Islamabad to undertake its own kinetic response, threatening at least a limited period of more cross-border attacks that will heighten a range of security risks in both countries. Early May 7, the Indian military announced it had launched \"Operation Sindoor,\" claiming it struck nine sites of \"terrorist infrastructure\" linked to militant attacks in Kashmir. Four of the sites were reportedly located in Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, with the remaining five located in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Local media reports claim India's military used air assets to deploy standoff weapons, including SCALP/Storm Shadow cruise missiles and AASM HAMMER smart missiles, as well as loitering munitions to target alleged militant infrastructure. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri characterized the strikes as \"pre-emptive and precautionary,\" saying New Delhi acted in response to intelligence it had...",

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(ANNIRUDHA MOOKERJEE/AFP/Getty Images) For more than two months, Chinese and Indian forces have stood toe to toe on the Doklam Plateau. The standoff is just the latest manifestation of a border dispute that began long before Chinese soldiers tried to extend a road through the contested region June 16 -- and one that extends well past the area in question. Along the thousands of kilometers of sinuous border between China and India lie three main points of contention: Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The regions are the most likely sites of a military confrontation between China and India, and each presents its own set of strategic considerations....

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://frontline.thehindu.com?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ## Stories that help you connect the dots ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The restructuring of USAID and reductions in U.S. foreign aid will disrupt humanitarian and development programs across the world, which could worsen global health outcomes, destabilize security environments, accelerate democratic backsliding and create opportunities for rival powers to expand their influence. Efforts by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to restructure the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. government's humanitarian aid agency, accelerated on Feb. 3 after more than a thousand USAID contractors, many from the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, lost access overnight to the agency's systems. Later the same day, after signage was removed from USAID's headquarters in Washington D.C. and its official government website was taken down, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was stepping in as acting administrator for USAID and notified Congress of the agency's ''potential reorganization.'' U.S. officials reported that USAID would be incorporated under the U.S. State Department,...

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power.

Organizations like the VHP are on the upswing as Hindu nationalism grows in India. (NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India...",

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?
