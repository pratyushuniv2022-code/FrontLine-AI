[Articles](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/recent) India’s Prime Minister identifies the Maoist (or “Naxalite”) insurgency as India’s “single biggest internal security challenge.” The insurgency is today severe in scale and violence with 2,212 violent incidents in 2010 causing 1,175 casualties (713 civilian, 285 security force and 171 guerilla), a 63% increase since 2008. [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn1) Today, about 10,000 – 40,000 full-time insurgents wage a protracted peoples war to overthrow the Indian state across a vast “Red Corridor,” affecting 20 of India’s 28 states. India is currently waging a large-scale counterinsurgency campaign against the Maoists, deploying 70,000 paramilitary police in November 2009, many to the insurgent heartland in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, where 50 percent of all attacks were recorded in 2010. [\\[ii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn2) The Maoists benefit from “two Indias living side by side.” [\\[iii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn3) India is rapidly modernizing, but many inequalities are also widening – between rich and poor, town and country and upper and lower castes. Conditions for large swathes of rural India still compare with the worst of sub-Saharan Africa, and in many remote areas the state has long been absent. However, economic grievances alone do not correlate with Maoism, and in net terms, the Indian state has tremendous internal legitimacy – only 26 of India’s 100 poorest districts, and 20 of its 100 most illiterate are Maoist afflicted. [\\[iv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn4) In truth, Maoist legitimacy is restricted to the extreme end of India’s deprivation scale – amongst the adivasis (tribals) and dalits (“untouchables”) – where in addition to extreme human misery, a broader set of social and status grievances are being inflamed. Analyst Eric Randolph astutely noted on the issue that, “People can put up with a great deal of structural violence in their lives \\[…\\] particularly when it is all they have known. Instead, what tends to trigger acts of violent rebellion are specific flashpoints of injustice.” [\\[v\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn5) For the adivasis and tribals, there are plenty such flashpoints. India’s tribals – in particular the Gonds of Central India [\\[vi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn6) – are under intense assault from state and private corporate interests, and are being pushed off their forestlands by giant hydro, logging and mining projects for little compensation and rehabilitation. The dalits, already the bottom rung of landless agricultural farmers, are similarly disproportionately impacted by the tumultuous changes of modernization on the Indian countryside, and discriminated against daily despite legislation. Tribals make up the core fighting strength of the Maoist insurgency – their narrow eight percent share of the population is still sizeable given India’s 1.2 billion peoples. The Maoist insurgency follows on a long history of peasant and tribal rebellion against predatory state structures on the subcontinent. It originated in its present form in a small village in Naxalbari, West Bengal, where in 1967, villagers armed with bows and arrows resisted police and feudal landlords with bows and arrows. [\\[vii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn7) The incident galvanized the Indian Communist movement, which found a fertile audience for its Chinese-inspired Maoist rhetoric of land reform and overthrow of feudal class structures. Militant Communism has since waxed and waned for the past half century, crushed by security forces and de-legitimized by the Indo-Chinese War of 1962, but the current phase of escalation is the strongest and most violent in history. In 2004, the two largest insurgent groups – the People’s War Group and the Maoist Communist Center – merged to form the new Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI-M). The merger elevated security hardliners in insurgent command, reiterated their commitment to violent and large-scale “peoples war,” and immediately increased insurgent kinetic activity. Today, the CPI-M accounts for 90% of attacks and 95% of fatalities from “left-wing terrorism,” according to the Indian Home Ministry. [\\[viii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn8) Maoist insurgents are tactically effective and intimately familiar with their jungle terrain. They employ classic guerilla tactics, dispersing in the face of organized force and prioritize their links with the population –often through violent intimidation. Their dispersed organizational structure mitigates the risk of being decisively impacted by targeted counterinsurgent (CI) operations. Local cells have tremendous autonomy, reflected in the fact that since 2007, six of the fourteen members of the Politburo, the highest echelon of insurgent command, have been arrested, to little discernible impact in the field. [\\[ix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn9) Unusual in COIN campaigns, Maoist guerillas have the tactical advantage over Indian security forces, and have demonstrated the ability to conduct sophisticated large-scale operations. Insurgents assault training centers and police stations to capture weaponry, attack jails to break out captured comrades and target judges and state functionaries to weaken state presence. Their lethality has grown with the use of IEDs, which now result in the majority of CI casualties. Despite a total lack of external support, the Maoists have ready access to funding – territories under their control are resource-rich and the insurgents maintain an extensive and lucrative extortion network that may net them as much as 14 billion rupees ($300 million) annually. [\\[x\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn10) Part of the insurgent “tax” is explosives used in the mining sector, which companies are often in no position to refuse. [\\[xi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn11) **A Military-Centric Response** India has grown acutely aware of the Maoist threat, but the effort to date remains vastly inadequate, both in mobilizing capacity and in implementing policy. The current counterinsurgent (CI) strategy is typically Indian – manpower-intensive and enemy-centric. It emphasizes building up force numbers to “saturate” areas with government forces and prioritizes kinetic action to suffocate the insurgency by attrition. Only lip service is paid to Western-style population-centric strategy; CI forces are present to target insurgents, not secure the population. The resultant flood of ill-trained and ill-equipped soldiers conducting large-scale sweep and commando operations has exposed civilian populations to collateral damage and abuse, increased Maoist legitimacy and recruitment, and left populations open to reprisal attacks by insurgents. As such, it likely that the scale and intensity of violence will increase in the short-term, but over the longer-term, the sheer mass of government capacity may tip the balance. Even so, brute military force is unlikely to ever fully extinguish an insurgency that is driven primarily, if not exclusively, by social and status grievances. In India’s federalist structure, states assume primary responsibility for combating Maoism, but their inadequacy has forced central “paramilitary” police forces to assume the leading COIN role. “Operation Green Hunt” launched in November 2009 deployed about 70,000 Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF) personnel (split roughly evenly between combat and support staff) to reach a 2011 end-strength of 73 battalions across Maoist-affected states. [\\[xii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn12) The CRPF is India’s largest internal security force and is a resource provider of sorts for the central government – sending emergency infusions of armed police to insecure areas across the country. [\\[xiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn13) The nomenclature of “paramilitary” typically attributed to the CRPF may overestimate its true capabilities – it is nowhere close to being a specialized CI force. [\\[xiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn14) In Kashmir, some CRPF units received intensified resourcing and training allowing them to independently secure key terrain districts, [\\[xv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn15) but in net terms, the CRPF is subject to all the problems of the Indian police sector including chronic shortfalls of equipment, training, leadership, and logistical and administrative support. It struggles in basic constabulary operations – let alone open combat against a tactically proficient insurgent on home terrain. Symbolic of the challenge, some CRPF units’ still lack protective vests, even while deployed in frontline combat roles! [\\[xvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn16) For anti-Maoist operations, the CRPF is supported by other state armed police forces, i.e. those state police units trained for higher grade law and order problems, including India Reserve Battalions (IRB). These forces are more competent than the regular police, but there is generally a net decline in combat capacity, discipline and professionalism down the hierarchy of security institutions. Scale, capacity and terrain challenges severely hamper the CI force. 70,000 troops cannot by themselves realistically expect to affect any measurable difference over a population of at least 450 million people across 1.86 million square kilometers of tough, remote terrain [\\[xvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn17) – especially without adequate support from effective civil police for regular law and order functions. The UN recommends a peacetime police-to-population ratio of 222 policemen per 100,000 members of the population, which India – and especially its insurgency-affected areas – falls far short of. [\\[xviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn18) In the Maoist heartland of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, new figures show their police-to-population ratios at 226 and 206 in 2010, [\\[xix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn19) a dramatic improvement (at least on paper) from 2000, when the ratio was a mere 50! [\\[xx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn20) Other states lag far behind. Orissa remains at 136, West Bengal at 100, and Bihar at just 74. [\\[xxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn21) Numbers tell only part of the story. Indian police are notoriously corrupt and brutal by Western standards. Draconian sedition laws punish even the semblance of sympathy for the Maoist cause, [\\[xxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn22) and anti-Maoist operations regularly leave behind a trail of destruction – including serious abuses such as torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions and rape. [\\[xxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn23) In the field many units – other than some elite forces – are tactically outmatched. Maoists benefit from the guerilla’s ability to choose the time and place of engagement, allowing them to confront the state at its weakest points. Coordinated attacks have penetrated high-security areas with relative impunity, but most notable was the 2010 Maoist ambush in Dantewada that killed 76 soldiers of the 62nd CRPF Battalion, the single largest loss of life in Indian COIN history. The event deeply undercut the Indian government’s claims of progress, and revealed systemic failures. 62 Bn. had served previously in anti-Naxal operations in Bihar, but like other CRPF units was shifted in an ad hoc manner on the basis of availability rather than suitability for the mission. As a result, it failed to acclimatize to the local physical and human terrain, evident when the force found itself trapped on a narrow jungle path. An IED was able to halt the entire column by disabling the lead vehicle, and well-positioned guerillas prevented any retaliatory maneuver. [\\[xxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn24) Chronic deficiencies in leadership were also evident – not uncommon in a force that sees its best officers poached by other agencies. [\\[xxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn25) The unit commander reportedly lied about his position to avoid a long-range field patrol, and failed to report a lost radio that likely allowed guerillas to track to column over several days. [\\[xxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn26) Insurgent intelligence dominance was easily evident – the Maoists were able to maneuver 1,000 men into place without detection, no doubt benefiting from at least some local support. Dantewada was an exceptional incident, but there are a legion other equipment and training challenges that limit CI abilities. Drastic expansion in force size has come without a commensurate emphasis on building up an adequate support base. Troops are barracked in terrible living conditions and there is widespread resentment at the perceived lack of political support, as well as the lack of clarity and resources with which to conduct their missions. Force protection is low, especially against IEDs. Deployed counter-IED equipment is limited [\\[xxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn27) and current armored vehicles provide inadequate protection, forcing a reliance on vulnerable dismounted patrols. New armored vehicles are being introduced – but Maoists have generally adapted by increasing the size of their bombs. [\\[xxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn28) Unsurprisingly, morale is low. One soldier angrily declared to an embedded reporter, “Have you ever seen a war being fought like this? We don’t know if we are here to assist the state police on law and order or to flush out Naxals, or merely to oscillate between troubled territories, getting our jawans (soldiers) killed for no fault of theirs.” [\\[xxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn29) He went on to point out various shortcomings including inadequate and sporadic rations, virtually no support for injured and killed soldiers, and points out that even “when I go on leave or when I am on my way back home \\[from camp\\], I travel that distance at the mercy of God or the Naxals. What morale are you talking about?” [\\[xxx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn30) Despite their tactical capabilities, Maoists adhere to classic guerilla tactics, readily ceding territory in the face of organized state offensives, even “liberated areas” such as Lalgarh district. Their mobility and trans-bordered nature allows them to exploit weak intra-state cooperation, making border areas between states particularly troublesome. Some states such as Chhattisgarh have multiple tri-junctions – where the borders of three states meet – allowing insurgents to mount attacks across state lines before retreating to safe havens. [\\[xxxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn31) Success in one state – such as Andhra Pradesh – may only displace insurgents into others; the neighboring states of Orissa and Chhattisgarh have seen significant spikes in violence since. Several initiatives have been unveiled to overcome the jurisdictional conflicts that plague effective trans-border policing, most notably by creating unified commands in insurgency-affected states. Designed to act as ‘fusion centers’ to facilitate cooperation between states, between state and federal forces, and between civilian and military personnel, their result has so far been underwhelming, not least because of the pushback from many state and local governments. On the local level, a political-criminal interface ensures that many politicians are eager to collude with Maoists and profit from their control of mines and resources. In some states – such as Jharkhand and Bihar – political rivalries mean that states refuse to cooperate with federal efforts, and in others, leaders collude with the Maoists for self-preservation. In West Bengal, the state government has greatly slowed CI activity and all but allowed a Maoist sanctuary earning them greatly reduced levels of violence in the state, but damaging the overall COIN effort. [\\[xxxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn32) The easy availability of central forces has also resulted in many states neglecting their own police modernization efforts. Unsurprisingly, simply augmenting force numbers has not paid dividends. Chhattisgarh and Jharkand both saw insurgent attacks rise despite a police surge, whereas in Andhra Pradesh, the state which has most effectively combated Maoists, the police force in population terms remained constant. Credit for reversing insurgent momentum is generally given to the state’s elite ‘Greyhound’ force built to live and operate in the jungle as the guerilla did, and fight the Indian jungle equivalent of a “bush war.” The force’s 1,000 personnel across 30 “assault units,” benefited from rigorous training and superior equipment (particularly communications technology) and were able to rapidly deploy and effectively operate on Maoist terrain. The Greyhounds have been extremely effective, but they did not operate in a vacuum. Beyond elite forces, Andhra Pradesh pursued an effective state police capacity-building effort, spreading tactically trained personnel across the force, and building synergistic relationships between the district police, intelligence assets and the Greyhounds. [\\[xxxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn33) The state also benefited from focused efforts to improve its COIN doctrine. It coordinated police strategies, created fortified police districts in vulnerable areas, improved intelligence sharing between security agencies, [\\[xxxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn34) cross-trained regular police units with elite police commando forces, and measurably implemented well-crafted community development programs. Unfortunately through the militarized lens of India’s COIN campaign, only the warfighting elements of Andhra Pradesh’s strategy have been replicated with earnest. The CRPF is raising ten Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (COBRA) battalions to reach an envisioned end-strength of about 10,000 men. [\\[xxxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn35) COBRA battalions are expected to be some of the best-equipped paramilitary troops in the country, and are trained specifically for the Maoist fight. They are armed like a regular Army infantry platoon and are trained in counter-guerilla and jungle warfare operations at the elite Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS), the Indian Army’s premier unconventional warfare training institution. State police forces – such as the India Reserve (IR) battalions are also are tasked with raising two companies of specialized ‘commando’ forces per battalion [\\[xxxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn36) \\- and more state police forces are being given at least some advanced warfare training. This militarization of the police may yield results in terms of removing insurgents from the field, but comes with the tradeoff in diverting attention and resources away from the equally crucial task of increasing and professionalizing regular policing capacity to “hold” cleared territory. Another worrying trend has been the outsourcing of security responsibilities to auxiliary non-state militias that operate with little oversight, training or accountability, and yet are deputized under the aegis of ‘Special Police Officers’ (SPOs) with official government sanction. Most prominent was the Salwa Judum (literally translated to “Purification Hunt” in the local Gondi dialect), a Chhattisgarh government-sponsored and equipped militia of about 5,000 lightly armed tribal people. Salwa Judum may have benefited from support and funding from mining companies, and was widely accused of extreme human rights abuses including forcible displacements of villages, killings and rape. In response, in July 2011, the Indian Supreme Court declared SPOs illegal and unconstitutional and ordered their disbandment. Indian security officials had routinely justified these forces as helping them ‘localize’ their force presence, build up human intelligence networks and provide alternative employment opportunities for tribal youth. They came, however, with substantial tradeoffs including the militarization of tribal society and the emergence of ‘warlords’ who maintain control over refugee camps and swathes of territory – making disbandment and reintegration difficult. [\\[xxxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn37) However, despite their record, SPOs did provide an important “force multiplier” for culturally foreign CI forces, and their replacement with regular police will take time – by some accounts at least a year. [\\[xxxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn38) Moreover even if SPOs are abandoned fully – itself a dubious prospect – other shadowy vigilante groups also exist, including the several “Cobra” organizations in Andhra Pradesh that retaliate against Maoist violence, particularly if committed against military and government officials. [\\[xxxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn39) As detailed, Indian CI forces suffer many capacity shortfalls that impede their operational effectiveness, but major reforms are currently ongoing that could significantly increase the quality of anti-Maoist CI forces. Israeli assault rifles are being purchased, [\\[xl\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn40) helicopters being redeployed back from peacekeeping missions ostensibly for anti-Maoist operations, [\\[xli\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn41) and retired army soldiers being recruited as trainers. [\\[xlii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn42) Two of three sanctioned UAVs have been inducted to improve ISR capabilities and detect massed insurgent forces – although forested terrain restricts their utility [\\[xliii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn43) \\- and a variety of other new equipment is being inducted. All these if utilized effectively can improve the CI capacity to kill insurgents, but it is less certain that they can strategically end the insurgency. **Inadequate Social, Political and Economic Redress** The Indian state has focused on combating the insurgency by military means, but addressing the legitimate economic and social grievances of tribal peoples has been less forthcoming. Rural development in India comes with significant scale challenges, affecting 1/3rd of the entire world’s poor and traversing remote areas where the government has traditionally been absent. Improving tribal welfare is a component of the broader growth and modernization of India, and as such competes with a host of other priorities. Development projects come with sizeable time-lags that must be factored in – effective policy will require sustained funding and attention over a period of years without immediately apparent results. Development must be recognized for the offensive weapon that it is – both in attacking insurgent legitimacy and in binding tribals to the Indian state by destroying their earlier forms of social existence. [\\[xliv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn44) Moreover, it is not a panacea. Efforts to raise economic and human welfare standards must come alongside broader reforms in social justice and local governance to mitigate predatory and corrupt local administrative structures. It is not for nothing that the insurgent heartland in Chattisgarh and Jharkhand corresponds with the two worst governed states in the country. [\\[xlv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn45) Tighter regulation of private industry is also necessary, including measures to ensure rehabilitation for those displaced by mining projects, and efforts to compensate for and mitigate the ecological and social impacts of extraction. India has admittedly prioritized rural development – elevating its ministry to a cabinet level position in 2011 – and significantly increased allocations to Maoist-affected areas through targeted entitlements. However, rural development to date has been superficial and ineffective, with emphasis on increased allocations obscuring problems in implementation and a lack of progress towards desired outcomes. The Maoist Integrated Action Plan for example provided 250 million rupees in 2010, and 300 million in 2011 in discretionary funds for quick-impact human welfare projects including building facilities for drinking water, sanitation, health clinics, roads etc. Data to date, however, suggests that only a quarter of allocated money has been spent and only 15 percent of projects completed. [\\[xlvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn46) This is despite the obvious fact that sincere development is appreciated – in February 2011 the Maoist abduction of a district collector known for being an efficient and honest administrator led to tribal rallies and protests, forcing his release [\\[xlvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn47) There is, however, a prevalent belief that current patterns of insecurity dictate that stabilization must precede development. This is not an unreasonable view – it is obviously difficult to develop territory you do not control and the Maoists recognize that development can erode their control. As such, insurgents have targeted 1,241 ‘economic targets’ between 2007 and 2011, including roads, power plants, telephone towers etc. [\\[xlviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn48) Such targeting is entirely self-interested, seeking to keep communities isolated and insulated from the relief efforts and ensuring that Maoists are the sole providers of social services. Human Rights Watch for example details how Maoists shut down rural schools to create captive recruiting pools for their Bal Sangam child-brigades. [\\[xlix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn49) Government agents are prime Maoist targets, severely complicating outreach. CI forces have attempted to mitigate this problem by recently unveiling plans for seven new battalions of “specialized forces” that integrate engineering and security personnel. [\\[l\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn50) There are islands of success, but overall reconstruction and aid delivery efforts in Central India leave much to be desired. Plans look good on paper; the Saranda Action Plan for example seeks to build on successful clear operations with a series of entitlement plans – including issuing ration cards for the poor, creating rural work schemes and developing infrastructure to connect isolated communities. [\\[li\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn51) Unfortunately, many of these policies fail to be implemented effectively and a large proportion of allocated funds are leaked to inefficiency, corruption and the incompetence of the state machinery. Corruption in particular is not a side effect that can be ignored – the nexus between corrupt politicians, private industry and Maoists is a key driver of both tribal alienation from the state, as well as a major facilitator of insurgent freedom of action. Much development money is also believed to flow to Maoist hands in the form of protection money paid by reconstruction firms. **Lessons Learned** 1) Skewed priority of effort – The mission fails to integrate military and civilian efforts, and prioritizes tactical military decisions that may in many cases have strategic tradeoffs. Development and political outreach is tainted by police brutality, and ineffective military operations are a major driver of Maoist mobilization. Military missions must be designed and conducted carefully to minimize civilian alienation, and must be viewed as precursors for post-“clear” development and reconstruction. Civilian and military coordination must improve and emphasis must be placed on improving the conduct of security forces. 2) Over-Militarization of Police – The emphasis on building up paramilitary forces capable of taking the fight to the Maoists should not detract from efforts to build up competent civil police. Kinetic operations must be merely a prelude to a viable rule of law, which will require building up capacities in not just the civil police, but also the supporting justice and detention sectors. 3) Mobilize Scarce Assets – The Indian Army has rightly assessed that it is not trained or equipped to combat its own people, but it is the only Indian institution with the specialized capacity that could tip the Maoist fight. Aerial assets can improve ISR coverage, equipment such as counter-IED kits and armored vehicles can reduce police casualties, and Army trainers and facilities are the best available resource to build up small-unit combat capabilities and disseminate tactical lessons learnt from other theaters. 4) Improve unity of effort – The insurgency crosses borders, and so must the CI effort. Focus must be given to improving coordination between the many state and central agencies involved, and between states. The goal should be to create effective border management protocols that prevent insurgents from locating safe havens to regroup. 5) Attack insurgent legitimacy – CI actions should best sell their mission, but strategic communications can highlight Maoist complicity in corruption, extortion, and violent abuse at the expense of tribal communities. This is most viable if CI forces themselves adhere to tighter ethical codes of conducts than insurgents – not currently true. 6) Empower non-state actors with care – Actors such as Salwa Judum deeply de-legitimize the state and taint it by association. Especially in India, the population cannot easily distinguish between police branches or between formal and informal forces, and brutalities reinforce the predominant image of the Indian state as callous and predatory. 7) Improve the effectiveness of aid delivery – There must be a focus on outcomes over allocations. Emphasis should be paid on ensuring that projects are completed on time and to standard, and continual oversight should mitigate leakages. Projects should be visible and have immediate impact, and local communities must be involved from project design to completion. 8) Governance reform – Corruption and local predatory state structures are drivers of Maoist legitimacy and mobilization. A major facilitator of the insurgency is the willingness of local politicians to collude with Maoists and/or private industry at the expense of their constituents, and to enact self-interested policies that weaken the mission. Measures such as the sedition laws would be better suited to tackle direct support such as this, rather than human-right workers and ordinary civilians whose only crime is to extend moral support. 9) Aid is insufficient – Aid and quick-impact projects can only alleviate immediate needs. Broader economic and social reforms must be tackled with real urgency. A culture of impunity and blatant corruption must end; for politicians, police, and business elites, and inequalities between rich and poor and town and country must ease. Targeting Maoist-affected areas with increased funding and attention is probably good policy, but it is likely not an overstatement to say anti-Maoist success will correlate significantly with India’s progress in caring for its poorest peoples. * * * [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_ednref1) “Annual Report 2010-2011,” _Ministry of Home Affairs Republic Of India_, Available at [www.mha.nic.in](http://www.mha.nic.in/); “2010 bloodiest year for India’s Maoist rebellion,” _AFP,_ January 5, 2011.

It continues to be so.”_– Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.\\[i\\] _From Ideology To Warfare_ The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. _Resurgence_ Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. ### A New Strategy _“We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.”_-Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. _Overruns_ On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • **Used improvised explosive devices.** Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • **Assassinated officials.** In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • **Destroyed police infrastructure.** Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj _Systems Disruption_ At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? ### The Deviant Economic Engine _“The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.”_-Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. _The Revolutionary Tax_ In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. _A Revolutionary Tax Economy_ To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • **Mining.** Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • **Narcotics.** India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • **Informal tolls.** Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. ### A Strategic Half-Life _“It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they_ _look to the Naxals for justice.”_–Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future. _Sources:_ i Mahendra Kumawat, “Naxal Movement Has Shown Tremendous Grit,” Rediff News, April 9, 2010. ii Waquar Ahmed, Amitabh Kundu, and Richard Peet, India’s New Economic Policy: A Critical Analysis (New York: Routledge, 2011). iii Bibhudatta Pradhan and Santosh Kumar, “Pillai to End Maoist Grip on $80 Billion Investments,” Bloomberg Businessweek, September 17, 2010. iv Government of India, “Fact Sheet On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),” Ministry of Commerce and Industry, February 11, 2011, http://dipp.nic.in/fdi\\_statistics/india\\_FDI\\_February2011.pdf (accessed March 23, 2011). v Rahul Nilakantan and Saurabh Singhal, “The Economic Costs Of Naxalite Violence and the Economic Benefits of a Unique Robust Security Response,” 2010. http://www.aae.wisc.edu/mwiedc/papers/2011/Singhal\\_Saurabh.pdf (accessed April 3, 2011). vi “Chhattisgarh’s Entire Forest Area A Minefield?,” Times of India, May 10, 2010. vii Manoj Prasad, “Former Jharkhand CM Marandi on Their Hitlist, Naxals Kill Son, 17 More,” Indian Express, October 28, 2007. viii Press Trust of India, “Maoists Storm Jehanabad Jail,” Rediff News, November 14, 2005. ix Sudheer Pal Singh, “Illegal Mining May Impede Divestment in Coal India,” Business Standard, August 21, 2010. x Government of India, “Loss of Coal Production in Naxalite Areas,” Press Information Bureau, August 4, 2010, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=64116 (accessed January 4, 2011). xi “Chronology of Naxal Attacks on Trains,” India Today, May 28, 2010. xii Law Kumar Mishra, “Maoists Blow Up Track on Gaya-Dhanbad Section, Rail Traffic Disrupted,” Times of India, September 13, 2010. xiii “Naxal Attacks Doubled in 2009, Rlys Lost Rs 500cr: Mamata,” Times of India, April 23, 2010. xiv Manoj Prasad, “Naxal Attacks, Escalated Cost Derail Jharkhand Railway Projects,” India Express, April 12, 2010. xv Ishita Ayan Dutt, “Naxal Hits to Pull NMDC Net Down by Rs 1,000 cr,” Business Standard, April 20, 2010. xvi “NMDC to Lay 12 mt Pipeline on Highways to Avoid Naxal Attacks,” The Financial Express, July 20, 2010. xvii “Naxals Obstruct Road Works,” The Hindu, May 9, 2011. xviii Dutt. xix Sandeep Joshi, “550 More Mobile Towers to Boost Fight Against Naxalites,” The Hindu, June 30, 2010. xx “World Bank Approves $1.5 billion for India’s Rural Roads Scheme,” Press Trust of India, December 22, 2010. xxi Prassana Mohanty, “Maoists’ Financing – The Blood Flows as Long as the Cash Flows,” Governance Now, April 7, 2010. xxii Mohanty xxiii Sujeet Kumar, “Maoists extort Rs 300 Crore Annually in Chhattisgarh,” The Economic Times, July 5, 2009. xxiv Bharti Jain, “Rs 150 Crore: Maoists Extortion Amount From Chhattisgarh SSIs,” The EconomicTimes, April 10, 2010. xxv Ajit Kumar Singh and Sachin Bansidhar Diwan, “Red Money,” Outlook India, April 5, 2010. xxvi Ministry of Home Affairs, 2010-2011 Annual Report (Delhi: Government of India, 2011). xxvii Shaikh Azizur Rahman, “India’s Illegal Coal Mines Turn Into Death Pits,” The WashingtonTimes, November 24, 2006. xxviii Prasoon Majumdar, “Our Own Banana Republics!” Indian Institute of Planning andManagement, August 26, 2010, http://prasoonmajumdar.blogspot.com/2010/08/our-own-banana- republics.html (accessed April 29, 2011). xxix United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, “India is a Major Drug Hub: US,” September, 2007, http://www.unodc.org/india/en/rajiv\\_quoted\\_et.html (accessed February 25, 2011).",

It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. Picture source: Depositphotos. _Prospects & Perspectives No. 28_ **The Shadow War: How the Pahalgam Terror Attack Redefined India-China-Pakistan Equation** By _Jagannath Panda_ The Pahalgam [terror attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl) of April 2025, executed by the Pakistan-backed group [The Resistance Front](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473) (TRF), was not merely another episode in the long-running saga of India-Pakistan hostility. It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. By and large, India’s reaction was strong, swift, and assertive beyond the border against the terrorist outfits harbored in Pakistan. The launch of [Operation Sindoor](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473), a precise military response targeting terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC), marked a defining evolution in India’s deterrence doctrine, pointing to a zero-tolerance strategy against terrorism. More than a tactical strike, it was a message — India will respond with resolve, not restraint, when its civilians are attacked. The operation drew clear parallels with the Balakot airstrikes of 2019, yet the context had shifted. The regional climate in 2025 is far more combustible, with trilateral tensions simmering in the Himalayas. The Pahalgam incident has exposed deep-seated fractures in the regional power matrix. China’s strategic posture in the aftermath — marked by conspicuous silence, selective language, and diplomatic hedging — underscores a growing contradiction between its self-styled image as a responsible global power and its operational behavior in South Asia. By refusing to acknowledge the terrorist dimension of such attacks or to pressure its close partner, Pakistan, Beijing reveals a troubling unwillingness to act as a genuine stabilizing force in the region. The contradictions in its stand are only growing and becoming more transparent to the world by the day. Is China truly committed to regional peace and stability, or is it bound by time-worn strategic alignments that prioritize geopolitical advantage over normative responsibility? Can a power that positions itself as an architect of global order afford to undermine its credibility by shielding a state associated with cross-border terrorism? What should be India’s strategic response to this shadow war? **Beijing’s Balancing Act: Neutrality or Strategic Collusion?** Following India’s retaliation, the world watched closely for diplomatic fallout. China’s response was a masterclass in studied ambiguity. Beijing termed India’s military action “ [regrettable](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202505/t20250507_11616523.html)” while conspicuously omitting any condemnation of the terror attack itself. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made [no mention](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/lxjzh/202505/t20250509_11618305.html) of the victims in Pahalgam, nor TRF’s Pakistani connections. Instead, Beijing’s focus remained firmly on urging “restraint” and “dialogue,” echoing a playbook that has often shielded Islamabad from international censure. This is not entirely a new behavior on the part of the Chinese leadership. Beijing has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the UN Security Council to [block designations of known terrorists](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slams-china-at-un-for-blocking-move-to-designate-2611-accused-sajid-mir-as-global-terrorist/article66993043.ece) based in Pakistan, including Sajid Mir, a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander involved in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008. This pattern of diplomatic protection underscores China’s strategic calculus: Pakistan is more than an ally — it is a linchpin in Beijing’s South Asia strategy and a buffer against Indian regional ascendency. What makes China’s stance especially problematic is its persistent refusal to differentiate between India’s counterterrorism actions and aggressive behavior. Chinese state media and official discourse frequently conflate Indian responses along the LoC with assertive conduct along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), crafting a narrative in which India is portrayed as a regional aggressor. This distortion allows Beijing to simultaneously align with Pakistan’s security outlook while maintaining a superficial neutrality. Moreover, China’s behavior mirrors its broader geopolitical approach: internal threats such as “Uyghur separatism” are met with uncompromising state violence, while external threats that affect neighbors like India are compartmentalized or ignored. The selective outrage is a window into Beijing’s dual standards on terrorism and state sovereignty. **Proxy Wars and Silent Partners: Redrawing the Diplomatic Map** Beyond the rhetoric, Beijing’s alignment with Pakistan is rooted in hard interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the crown jewel of Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This infrastructure project is not just about roads and pipelines — it’s about strategic depth. Any Indian challenge to the territorial status quo threatens both Pakistan’s and China’s investments, thereby sealing the logic of Beijing’s indirect complicity. This complicity extends into the diplomatic arena. In multilateral forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China has consistently [blocked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/human-rights-must-be-respected-india-after-skipping-xinjiang-vote/articleshow/94713915.cms) Indian attempts to highlight Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism. Instead, China promotes counterterrorism frameworks that align neatly with its own domestic narratives, especially those concerning Xinjiang, while conveniently avoiding issues that implicate Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues its [strategic silence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/22/asia/imran-khan-xinjiang-axios-intl-hnk) on China’s repression of Uyghur Muslims, despite its self-styled image as a champion of the Islamic world. This tacit exchange of blind spots — on terrorism and human rights — has become the bedrock of the Sino-Pakistani axis. And India, despite walking a tightrope on sensitive Chinese issues like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, has received no reciprocation in the form of diplomatic neutrality or support. The geopolitical geometry is clear: while India and Pakistan battle over borders and ideology, China plays the dual role of facilitator and firewall for Islamabad. Whether in backchannel diplomacy or in global institutions, China consistently acts to dilute pressure on Pakistan, reinforcing a strategic triangle that disadvantages New Delhi at every turn. Beijing’s deliberate omission of Pakistani provocations and cross-border violence in its Operation Sindoor response press briefings suggests a calculated strategic posture. This silence reflects China’s continued alignment with Pakistan, indicating that broader geopolitical considerations outweigh any immediate concerns about regional instability. By not publicly addressing Islamabad’s role, China signals its intent to preserve and prioritize its long-standing strategic partnership with Pakistan. **A Call for India’s Strategic Realignment** In this increasingly tangled web of interests, India must reassess its China doctrine. The idea of Beijing as a potential stabilizer in South Asia has little basis in reality. Instead, China has shown a consistent willingness to prioritize its strategic partnerships and investments over regional peace or normative alignment against terrorism. One avenue for India is to adopt a strategy of normative reciprocity. If China insists on referring to Jammu and Kashmir as a “disputed territory,” India could begin more openly addressing Chinese sensitive issues, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and potentially even Taiwan, revisiting its “One China” policy. Until now, India has largely upheld a principle of “mutual sensitivity” regarding core sovereignty concerns. While China has been increasingly assertive in internationalizing the Kashmir issue — whether through UN Security Council interventions, statements aligning with Pakistan, or selective cartographic provocations — India has avoided reciprocal commentary on China’s sensitive regions. This asymmetric restraint has allowed China to shape narratives unchallenged, while denying India the same deference on issues central to its national unity. Engaging Taiwan more openly — especially on trade, technology, and democratic solidarity — aligns India with other democracies like the U.S., Japan, and parts of Europe that have gradually normalized unofficial ties. Strengthening ties with Taiwan also offers India access to high-end manufacturing, especially in semiconductors, where Taiwan’s TSMC dominates global supply chains, critical for India’s tech and defense sectors. A closer India-Taiwan dynamic could be used as part of a broader Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance Chinese assertiveness in the region, especially when coupled with defense dialogues like the Quad. Explicit moves on Taiwan would likely provoke strong diplomatic and possibly economic retaliation from Beijing. This could take the form of border pressure along the LAC, trade restrictions, or cyber disruptions. Any move on Taiwan would have more impact if coordinated with partners like the U.S., Japan, or Australia. A unilateral shift may yield limited strategic gain while exposing India to disproportionate costs. It is therefore imperative that India must continue to invest more robustly in multilateral and minilateral coalitions that exclude or counterbalance China, such as the Quad, the India-Japan-Australia trilateral, and enhanced EU engagements. India’s aspiration to be recognized as a major international power, including in the “Global South,” depends not solely on its material capabilities but also on its normative influence, particularly in shaping global discourses on terrorism. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, New Delhi may need to recalibrate its approach by intensifying collaboration with global norm entrepreneurs, including middle powers across Europe and Asia, as well as transnational civil society and multilateral institutions. Moreover, India’s leadership roles in forums such as the G20 and BRICS present strategic platforms through which it can reframe regional security narratives and assert its vision for counterterrorism norms. Domestically, India must prepare for the long haul. The possibility of a coordinated two-front scenario — with Pakistan engaging in asymmetric warfare through proxy actors and irregular tactics and China providing strategic and diplomatic cover — is no longer hypothetical. Preparing for this evolving threat environment requires India to adopt a comprehensive and long-term security posture, encompassing military modernization, institutional resilience, and societal preparedness. Enhancing border infrastructure, upgrading intelligence and surveillance capabilities, and fortifying strategic deterrence must be non-negotiables in India’s defense roadmap. Sustaining a prolonged state of readiness requires a resilient defense-industrial base, robust supply chains, and financial planning. India must continue reforms to reduce dependence on foreign arms imports, incentivize indigenous R&D, and create strategic reserves for critical materials. Further, building robust logistical networks, especially in border states and high-altitude regions, will improve troop mobility and sustain long-term deployments. Civil-military synergy in infrastructure projects such as roads, airfields, and telecommunications along both western and eastern frontiers is essential. The shifting threat landscape demands that India move beyond reactive postures. Both Pakistan and China are adept at leveraging information warfare and disinformation to influence public opinion and sow discord. India must invest in counter-disinformation capacities, strategic communication, and public awareness campaigns to build regional and societal resilience against foreign psychological operations, where Taiwan could emerge as a stronger partner. New Delhi must significantly enhance its capabilities in narrative warfare — a strategic effort to shape perceptions, control the discourse, and influence international opinion. This involves not only countering adversarial narratives but also proactively framing its own story in a manner that resonates with global audiences. India’s case against Pakistan-based terrorism, as well as China’s tacit support through diplomatic silence or selective framing, must be articulated with clarity, credibility, and moral authority. To be effective, this narrative must be disseminated across multiple global platforms — from the United Nations and international media to think tanks, academic forums, and digital diplomacy channels — to expose the regional destabilizing roles of both Pakistan and China, and to align international sentiment with India’s security concerns and normative positions. The decision to send [delegations](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seven-all-party-delegations-to-take-indias-message-against-terrorism-to-key-partner-nations-government/article69586448.ece) to 32 nations is a strong first step. Publishing credible evidence, such as satellite imagery, financial trail disclosures, or intercepted communications, can further strengthen the factual basis of India’s narrative and pre-empt counterclaims. **Conclusion: Pahalgam as a Turning Point** The Pahalgam terrorist attack will be remembered not just for its human toll, but for what it revealed about the shifting tectonics of regional power complexities. It was a moment of clarity: India is not just facing a belligerent neighbor in Pakistan, but also contending with a cunning and double-standard power in China that is willing to obscure terrorism behind the veil of strategic self-interest. Increasingly, China’s actions — or calculated inactions — are rendering its strategic contradictions more visible to the international community, challenging the coherence of its South Asia policy and weakening its claim to impartiality in regional conflict resolution. The path ahead for India requires more than conventional military readiness; it calls for a fundamental reassessment of the strategic assumptions underpinning India's approach to China, particularly regarding Beijing’s role in shaping, enabling, or deferring regional crises. New Delhi’s challenge is two-fold. It must deter asymmetric threats from across the border, and it must decode and counteract the quieter, more insidious enablers of that threat. That means not just stronger borders, but sharper diplomacy. Not just better arms, but better arguments. Narrative warfare, if conducted strategically, allows India not just to defend its position but to shape the global agenda on terrorism and regional order, reinforcing its claim to normative leadership as a rising power. Pahalgam may have been a tragedy for India, but it is also an inflection point. A new foreign policy realism must follow. Because in this geopolitical theatre, the shadows are as dangerous as the swords.

Its four primary partners, U.S. Pacific Command, Tripler Army Medical Center, the University of Hawaii and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention act collectively to support a body of operational research. Disaster Response in India represents the first product of these efforts. The Center of Excellence, a unique and forward-thinking partnership, acts as a facilitator among the many organizations which are critical players in the delivery of disaster management, relief and recovery. Its research mission cuts across organizational boundaries and thus the Center is able to identify proposals of universal benefit. Focusing through a collaborative lens allows the Center to work with more appropriate, multi-pronged approaches leveraged across civilian, military and private partnerships. The commitment to support operational research in a variety of fields and disciplines - from public and mental health issues in refugee populations to re-establishing functioning infrastructure in devastated communities - evolved from the core purposes of the Center, which is to bring together the best individuals and organizations who are dedicated to improving the world’s ability to respond to natural and complex humanitarian events. The authors’ work herein, the culmination of many hours of intensive labor, contributes to an appreciation of foreign disaster management processes, encourages international cooperation, and supports disaster management institutions and professionals in all countries and regions. To conduct and publish findings as these is of benefit to all peoples. In our shrinking, interdependent world, the drop of even a small stone in one place leads to ripples felt in the most remote corners of the world. It is our hope that this document will see widespread distribution, and through extensive use that it be passed along to colleagues as a tome on the topic. Fredrick M.

The number has been increasing every year because of the mixture of various factors such as adverse weather, population growth, urbanization, and industrialization. How the Republic of India organizes for managing significant natural and man-made disasters, its capacity for effective response, and its ability to achieve unity of effort among governmental and non-governmental organizations are the elements of analysis here. This is of interest because India is an emerging world power; it is currently the second largest country in the world in population, and by 2050 it will have surpassed China as the largest. The number of Indians affected by disaster events shows a steady upward trend. Disasters have been taking a heavy toll of human and animal lives. Floods have proven to be the most devastating type of natural disaster in India, causing the maximum number of deaths and damage to property (cyclones have taken a heavy toll of lives and caused widespread devastation). At the same time, droughts affect a large segment of population, resulting in loss of employment and migration to other regions. Earthquakes have caused a comparatively lower amount of damage, but landslides are likely to increase in frequency in the coming years because of deforestation and over development on hillsides. Conurbation and industrialization have combined to create a dangerous synergy that now presents a significant hazard to India’s people. In responding to these kinds of hazards, India’s disaster management officials and professional humanitarians conduct disaster planning and response generally within a paradigm of three phases: Pre-disaster; Emergency (or Disaster Impact); Post Disaster(or Recovery). There is a strong emphasis in government policy and planning to encourage mitigation, i.e., actions taken prior to the occurrence of a disaster, including preparedness and long-term risk reduction measures. 1 Elephants on the Rajpath Defending Rashtrapati Bhavan (President’s Palace) To encourage effective training, coordination and planning for disaster response, the Government of India established in 1995 a National Center for Disaster Management; and in 1998, India’s Minister for Agriculture announced the formation of a National Commission on Disaster Management. These will facilitate the evolution of a National Disaster Management Plan. The Plan is now under development and is expected to be completed in 2001. RESPONSE SYSTEM Under India’s federal system, the states have responsibility for disaster response. When the disasters is severe or spread over several states, the Central Government supplements the efforts of state governments by providing financial and material assistance. Government policy response to a natural calamity is provided by the Prime Minister, Cabinet Committees and the Agriculture Minister. The objectives of policy response are to address the sufferings of the people affected by the natural calamity. A policy response often leads to visits to the calamity affected areas by President, Prime Minister and other dignitaries; setting up machinery for implementing, reviewing and monitoring the relief measures; and activating the administrative response process for assistance in relief measures. The state governments in India are autonomous in organizing relief operations in the event of natural disaster and also for purposes of long term preparedness and rehabilitation measures. The states deal with natural disasters through their Revenue Departments or Relief Organizations. 2 REVENUE Division Commissioner DISTRICT MAGISTRATE Divisional Sub-Divisional MAGISTRATE TEHSILDARS PATEL OR PATWARI (POLICY AND PLANNING) (CONTROL ROOM) (DISTRICT) (SUB-DIVISION) (TEHSIL) (VILLAGE) OTHER DEPARTMENTS POLICE HOME GUARD CIVIL DEFENSE STATE CRISIS MANAGEMENT GROUP EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER RELIEF COMMISSIONER STATE GOVERNMENT CHIEF SECRETARY TYPICAL ORGANIZATION FOR STATE EMERGENCY The states also have a State Crisis Management Group (SCMG) which functions under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary and/or Relief Commissioner. The Group comprises senior officers from the departments of revenue and relief, home, civil supplies, power, irrigation, water supply, local self government (panchayat), agriculture, forests, rural development, health, planning, public works and finance. States develop the contingency plans for disaster response and long-term strategies for mitigation. The state response plan identifies the functional areas such as relief, communications, information, transport, health services, etc. and proposes assignments to the various departments. The plan also lays down preparedness checklists, operating procedures and reporting formats. The state mitigation strategy argues for better land use management, building codes, traffic standards, health standards, and so on. These objectives are to be secured through disaster legislation, mitigation regulation, and incentives for mitigation. The State Relief Commissioner establishes an Emergency Operations Center (Control Room) as soon as disaster situation develops. The Center collects and disseminates the latest information on forecasting and warning of disaster, and functions as the focal point for coordinating disaster relief efforts with the other concerned departments. THE FIRST RESPONDERS Every state is divided into a number of districts. The head of the district administration is known as the District Magistrate or Deputy Commissioner. (In some states, he is better known as the Collector). The District Magistrate is in charge of all the relief measures at the district level. The State government routes its instructions through him, and the District Magistrate ensures that the total efforts of the district are geared in a coordinated manner to providing disaster relief to the people. Sometimes, in emergency situations, the District Magistrate’s powers are enhanced with a view to ensuring complete unison in the efforts of all the concerned departments. A district is further sub-divided into sub-divisions and tehsils. The head of the sub-division is called a Sub-Divisional Officer or Deputy Collector while the tehsil is headed by an officer called the Tehsildar. The lowest unit of administration is the village whose revenue matters are attended to by a functionary known as Patel or Patwari. These lower tiers of administration provide the first responders that do the work, and 3 they are a critically important source of leadership during disaster events. When disaster strikes, the District Magistrate activates his contingency plan with the help of Control Room staff who monitor rescue and relief efforts. Also assisting is the District Relief Committee which includes local representatives of the people, members of the legislative assembly and the parliament. Through these mechanisms, the District Magistrate coordinates with central government authorities and defense forces, and he synchronizes the voluntary efforts of NGOs with the efforts of the district administration. THE NGOS India has a strong tradition of voluntary organizations responding to any calamity or disaster overwhelming the people. The voluntary organizations offer immediately available communications within the disaster affected community, technical services, manpower, and financial support. Services provided by the NGOs include awareness and information campaigns, training for local volunteers, immediate rescue and first aid, psychological aid, food, water, medicine, other materials, sanitation and hygiene, damage assessment, reconstruction and financial aid. The 1998 cyclone in Gujarat provides some idea of the scope of NGO emergency assistance during a disaster event in India: • CARE-India: food for two months and 350 tents worth Rs. 700,000; • CARITAS: housing reconstruction; • Catholic Relief Service: $10,000 for shelter and drinking water, and 161 tonnes of food supplies; • The Discipleship Center: plastic sheets, utensils, bed sheets, sarees, dhotis, and children’s clothing; • OXFAM: food grains, plastic sheets, clothing; • World Vision:roof tiles, wood materials for home reconstruction. India prefers not to request disaster assistance in any formal way from donor nations or international organizations. Its stated policy is that India will rely on its own resources to resolve disaster situations. But it is difficult to imagine disaster relief operations without the 4 contributions of the international and India-based NGOs. To avoid being at cross purposes with Indian policy, international organizations and donor nations usually provide disaster assistance resources to local level governments and grass-roots organizations via on-site NGOs. DISASTER RESPONSE AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE Disaster events in recent years have placed great demands on India’s disaster management system, and the year 1998 was a particularly bad one for the country. Floods affected several states. A cyclone of severe intensity devastated Gujarat. Landslides took a heavy toll of human lives in the hill regions of Uttar Pradesh. The Orissa cyclone of 1999 was the greatest natural disaster the country has faced in the 20th century. These hazards illustrate the magnitude of the challenge. Floods There were unprecedented rains in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir in September 1988. In Kapurthala district, the water from Beas river submerged about 150 villages under 8 to 12 feet of water. In Jalandhar, fifty per cent of the standing crops were destroyed. In Ropar, thousands of people were trapped in flood waters and had to spend several nights on the rooftops of their houses. Gurdaspur town had two to four feet of water. The Government of India formed a Crisis Management Group under the chairmanship of the Relief Commissioner. The Armed Forces helped to evacuate people, and provided air, land and water transportation. A voluntary body known as Flood Relief Society was formed with Justice Ajit Singh Bains, a retired judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, as Chairman to provide relief to the flood affected people of Punjab. The Society made Sikh and Hindu temples the focal points for collecting relief material. In Himachal Pradesh, Kinnaur, Una, Chamba, Kulu and Shimla were badly affected. More than a dozen bridges in different parts of the State collapsed, and about two thousand persons were marooned in the Pong dam area. Una was completely cut off. People living in Chamba along the Ravi river had to be shifted to safer places. The Border Security Forces personnel were marooned at their outposts. Thein dam was threatened. The Grand Trunk Road between Beas, Rayya and Khalichain was submerged under three to four feet of water. 5 Over 405 thousand cubic feet per second (cusecs) of water was flowing in river Sutlej on September 24 against its capacity of 305 thousand cusecs. There was panic about the safety of the Bhakra Dam. The reservoir attained the highest ever level of 1687.47 ft., which was above the maximum storage level designed for the dam. The Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) released the extra water without bothering about the capacity of the reservoirs below. The BBMB did not warn the district authorities or the people before releasing the water. People in areas downstream were caught unawares–aggravating the magnitude of the disaster. There was loss of life and property on a massive scale. In northern areas of India, catchment areas have deteriorated due to increasing deforestation and urbanization leading to the reservoirs getting silted, their storage capacity reduced, and life span cut short. The 1998 floods also affected large areas of northern and eastern states with Upper Assam being the worst affected. Nearly 5,000 villages were submerged, and a total of 3.6 million people were affected by the fury of the Brahmaputra river. Majuli, the largest river island in the world, was completely submerged and over 100,000 people living on the island had to be evacuated. In West Bengal, more than half the total population of Malda were rendered homeless–1.5 million people. Large areas of Murshidabad were inundated by the Bhagirathi river. Army and the Border Security Force personnel assisted the State administration in the rescue and relief operations. The Navy also sent boats and a team of 50 people including doctors to Malda. In Bihar, a total of nearly 12 million people in over 7,200 villages in 28 districts in north and central Bihar were affected. Army personnel assisted in relief works in Katihar and Darbhanga districts. There were floods in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya also. The severity of flooding in these states was comparatively less in the strategic sense, but no less serious to the victims. Cyclones in Gujarat and Orissa Gujarat state was lashed by a severe cyclonic storm on June 9, 1998. About 1,250 people were killed while over one thousand were reported missing. There was devastation on a large scale in the districts of Kutch, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Porbandar, Junagadh, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Banaskantha, Surat, Bharuch, Valsad and Navsari. Nearly 66 hectares of agricultural land was eroded and thousands of trees were uprooted. 6 The gateway along the Gulf of Kutch became a graveyard of vessels with 40 ships having run aground and five of them actually sinking. The Gujarat government reacted with a “caterpillar-like pace,” according to India Today magazine. In the State Assembly, the Congress members, during discussions on the tragedy, harped on the point that a majority of lives lost on June 9, 1998 along the Saurashtra-Kutch coastline could have been saved had the State Government implemented a sound disaster management plan. The Union Home Minister conceded that the cyclone forecast of the Meteorological Department had gone awry as there was no mention in its forecast that Kutch district, which was worst affected, would be hit. There was also lack of communication between the Kandla Port Trust Authorities and the district administration. It also came to light that the Kandla Port Trust had been repeatedly warned about the consequences of tampering with coastal ecosystems and building too many new projects in the Kandla Port area. Political considerations had led to project after project being cleared. The Government of Gujarat had even altered the Coastal Management Plan to facilitate projects in the Coastal Regulation Zone. In recent years, construction of chemical facilities, petroleum complexes, cement factories, ports and jetties had stripped the coastal natural barriers formed by coral outcrops, sand banks, mangrove plants and dunes. Nothing remained to impede the 200 km/h cyclonic winds and four-meter tidal waves—a large number of innocents died. In response, the Government of India decided to give assistance to the maritime states in the Ninth Plan for the protection of critical reaches of coastal areas. Under this scheme, the coastal areas would be protected by constructing sea walls. The Coastal Protection and Development Advisory Committee has prepared a comprehensive National Coastal Protection Project estimated to cost Rs. 16 billion. The cyclone which lashed Orissa on October 29, 1999 has been described by Sitakant Mahapatra as “perhaps the greatest tragedy Orissa has faced since the Kalinga war that converted... Ashoka to Buddhism.” The death toll was over 10,000 and the total loss of property has been estimated at Rs. 10 billion. Landslides On August 18, 1998, a massive landslide wiped out the entire Malpa village in the Pithoragarh district of Uttar Pradesh, killing about 210 people. Earlier, 76 people were killed in devastating landslides in the 7 Ukhimath block of Rudraprayag district on August 12. There were landslides in the Ukhimath area again on August 19, killing 26 people. A total of nearly 400 people are estimated to have been killed and 12 villages were wiped out in a series of landslides spread over a period of ten days in the hill regions of Uttar Pradesh. A team of 200 personnel from the Army, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Pradeshik Armed Constabulary and Border Security Force was rushed to Malpa to carry out the relief operations. The State Government announced an ex gratia of Rs. one hundred thousand each to the next of kin of those killed in the tragedy, Rs. 50,000.00 each to the injured, and Rs. 25,000.00 for the reconstruction of damaged houses. The community response was spontaneous. A correspondent who toured the region commented that the Ukhimath community set a stellar example in altruism. Every family fed at least one person affected by the landslides. “We take it that every family has one more member to look after,” as a student of the Garhwal University said. The Yuvak Mangal Dal and the Mahila Mangal Dal, voluntary associations of youth and women in the region, did yeoman’s service in rushing to the unsafe areas with succor. The Himalayan Environment Studies and Conservation Organization, an NGO, sent medicines and relief materials. In spite of recurring landslides in the region, adequate attention has not been paid to planning and preventative measures. The cumulative effects of deforestation, erosion, water-logging, salinity and nutrient depletion all over the country have led to a loss of approximately Rs.232 billion. Technological Disaster–Long-term Effects Remain The Bhopal gas tragedy, which took place on December 3, 1984, was the worst technological disaster of the country. It was the result of faulty design, poor maintenance and unsatisfactory plant operation. Union Carbide, a U.S.-based multinational company, had a plant manufacturing Sevin and other pesticides at Bhopal. On the night of December 2, methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas escaped into Bhopal’s night air. It is estimated that as as many as 18,000 human deaths resulted from the incident, and large numbers of livestock perished. Today, some 15 years after the event, relatively few people have been properly compensated for their losses, and there are perhaps as many as 125,000 people who are in an acute state of ill health as a result of a whole range of diseases like breathlessness, eye problems, 8 neurological disorders, menstrual and other reproductive abnormalities, anxiety, depression and obstructive pulmonary disease. The Bhopal experience has provided a number of lessons, such as the need to regulate the growth of industries producing hazardous products. The most important of these is suggested by Dr. R. B. Sharma, Director of the Disaster Management Institute in Bhopal: The basic point of disaster management recovery is the human dimension. We are too concerned with the material. There is little attention to what happens after the disaster. The cyclones, earthquakes, floods, and landslides of 1998 and 1999, as well as the lingering effects of the Bhopal tragedy, suggest the grand dimensions of India’s disaster management challenge. It also suggests the capabilities and capacities for disaster management in India today. THE FUTURE FOR INDIA’S DISASTER MANAGEMENT The overall trend is towards more disaster-related deaths and losses. Some reasons for this are: • Continuing population growth which will overload the available infrastructure and services, even without the advent of disasters; • Increasing pressure on a land that will have to feed the world’s most populous nation but, year after year, is vulner\u0002able to the vagaries of weather; • Uneven economic growth that may result in a better life for some sectors while leaving oth\u0002ers destitute and unable to ward off hazards; • Interdependence of countries and regions whereby hazards in one region impact directly on others, such as low-land flooding caused by denudation of upland forests, or a nuclear accident in one region which casts fallout on another. 9 Bhopal: The Union Carbide Plant as it Appears Today. Experience shows that in the event of a disaster, the government response is generally tardy. Critics suggest that this is because the bureaucracy, which was once considered the “steel frame” of administration, has over the years become inefficient and corrupt. Millions are spent on flood protection schemes and drought relief measures, but only a fraction really shows. Analyzing disaster management in India, Times of India commentator Rajiv Desai recently wrote: Lives are lost, families ruined and property is destroyed. The only survivors are those who govern: politicians, bureaucrats and their retinue. ...no one is held accountable for public safety. Thus, the very minimum requirement of governance is waived. Never mind disaster management, the government itself is the disaster. The Government of India has the requisite structure to cope with disasters. There are detailed orders and manuals on related subjects, particularly at the state level. However, the Central Government has yet to publish a national emergency management plan and lacks the formal and official framework for strategic guidance and doctrinal development. Nevertheless, the confluence of effort by professionals associated with organizations such as the National Center for Disaster Management, Disaster Management Institute, Indira Gandhi National Open University, and so on, has developed a body of knowledge relevant to India’s situation. The universal themes which have evolved from this effort suggest the following doctrinal imperatives for future initiatives: • A strong focus on disaster prevention and mitigation; • Long-term measures to fight earthquake–economic and technical effort; • Control of economic development to reduce the impact on the land and resulting changes to the flow of water run-off; • Setaside funding by the states for disaster emergencies, aug\u0002mented by Central Government grants; • The need for networking among disaster management organiza\u0002tions, government agencies, and non-government volunteer or\u0002ganizations; 10 • An emphasis on training and publishing the professional body of knowledge; • Emphasis on the human dimension of disasters, particularly the social, medical, and psychological aspects of long-term recovery. Given India’s constitutional guidelines of state responsibility for disaster management, a ponderous bureaucracy, an historical preference for devolving responsibility to regional levels of government, it seems likely that India’s forthcoming National Disaster Management Plan will provide generalized policy constructs. The locus of disaster prevention and relief will remain with state governments, with the primary burden carried by the District Magistrate. Under siege by the current onslaught of cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and landslides, nuclear weapons bring an added dimension to India’s disaster management challenge. The confrontation between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir problem poses a proximate threat to peace and stability in the sub-continent. The acquisition of nuclear capability by both India and Pakistan has added a new and unwanted component to disaster prevention and assistance. As some Indian disaster specialists suggest, there remains some comfort in what seems to be India’s almost unlimited capacity to absorb shocks. There have been waves of invasion from across the north-west frontier through the centuries, but the spirit of India was never vanquished. India always reasserted itself, and with this spirit of certitude India will approach the coming challenges of disaster response in the new millennium. 11",

Reached after years of negotiations to resolve a military standoff that began in eastern Ladakh, the agreement is a testament to the complex yet critical nature of bilateral ties between the two Asian giants and appears to have thawed the otherwise fraught relationship. The two countries [held 21 rounds of corps commander level meetings](https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/37645/21st+round+of+IndiaChina+Corps+Commander+Level+Meeting) seeking complete disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and restoration of normalcy and peace. The pact allows for the [resumption of patrols](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/india-china-have-arrived-border-patrolling-pact-indias-top-diplomat-says-2024-10-21/) along the [disputed border](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-china-complete-80-90-pc-disengagement-in-eastern-ladakh/articleshow/114696063.cms?from=mdr), enabling both states to underscore their territorial claims while ensuring adherence to the agreed terms. While the triangular dynamics between India, China, and Pakistan have been complex, the India-Pakistan [ceasefire](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/world/asia/pakistan-india-ceasefire.html) in 2021 left India to largely focus on its standoff along the LAC and broader competition with China. The resolution of this border standoff indicates that India’s threat perception of China have shifted beyond a purely security calculus to focus on other considerations, such as the resumption of economic ties, and operate independently of its relationship with the United States. However, even though this agreement assuages India’s perceptions of a two-front threat, tensions between India and Pakistan will still persist. The resolution of this border standoff indicates that India’s threat perception of China have shifted beyond a purely security calculus to focus on other considerations, such as the resumption of economic ties, and operate independently of its relationship with the United States. ## Terms of the Agreement The agreement [includes](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-india-china-border-patrol-agreement-and-why-it-is-important-6844560) provisions for both countries to withdraw troops from specific areas of contention along the LAC, to avert risks of any further confrontations. It also outlines structured patrolling arrangements, intended to maintain the status quo and prevent any unilateral changes to the LAC. The agreement also calls for a continuous monitoring system to verify the status of troop withdrawal and patrolling activities, outlining a framework for resolving any future disagreements or stand-offs through dialogue at various levels, from local military commanders to diplomatic channels. It also acknowledges that the broader territorial dispute remains unresolved and opens the door for continued diplomatic engagement to resolve these longstanding issues. The timing of the announcement by India and China – just before both countries were set to attend the [BRICS summit](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/22/russias-brics-summit-whats-on-the-agenda-and-why-does-it-matter) – is noteworthy. The subsequent meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the summit materialized their political alignment to ease tensions and pave the way for improved political and economic ties. ## Impact on India’s Threat Perceptions While there is a sense of relief that the standoff – which had escalated tensions and led to the loss of lives – has moved towards [de-escalation](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg0gwy0nlyo), there is skepticism concerning the agreement’s durability, especially given Indian mistrust of Beijing due to previous [India-China](https://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/Bilateral-Brief-Updated_21-August-2023.pdf) border disputes. Thus, the agreement might not necessarily indicate that India and China have completely moved past historical grievances, especially since the lack of detailed public information on the deal’s terms suggests that negotiations may still be ongoing. However, overall, the agreement suggests a shift in India’s perception of China as a threat. A stabilized border [frees up resources](https://www.india-briefing.com/news/india-china-defrost-ties-at-brics-summit-key-expectations-34920.html/) and fosters economic growth.

In fact, both states have signaled with this agreement that they prioritize pragmatic reasons to seek a temporary peace over strategic concerns. For China, it may diffuse some of the [economic and diplomatic pressure](https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/india-china-ties-at-a-crossroads-as-security-economic-pressures-clash-3201218) from the unresolved conflict along the LAC coupled with a slowing domestic economy, real-estate challenges, and Western restrictions on Chinese goods. By easing relations with India, China also seeks to prevent New Delhi from imposing further restrictions on Chinese investments or hardening existing policies. The agreement signals to the West that bloc politics is rendered void when economic considerations come into play. ## U.S. Factor and Triangular Dynamics The border agreement poses a significant question as to its potential impact on the budding relationship between the United States and India. Since the early 2000s, the U.S.-India partnership has [deepened](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/21/joint-fact-sheet-the-united-states-and-india-continue-to-expand-comprehensive-and-global-strategic-partnership/), especially considering India’s participation in initiatives like [the Quad](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/tag/the-quad-alliance-quadrilateral-security-dialogue/) and [I2U2](https://www.state.gov/i2u2/). Their cooperation in the realms of defense, technology, and economic issues reflects shared concerns over China’s regional assertiveness. Consequently, India’s agreement to this deal with China demonstrates India’s desire to bolster its economy, its self-confidence in taming its strong neighbor and securing its borders, and practicing an independent foreign policy from the United States. While India has indicated that it intends to keep working with the United States, its individual handling of its border crisis with China exhibits its desire to keep a multialigned foreign policy. Although the United States applauded the pullback of Chinese and Indian forces from the border, it underlined that it had [no role](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/us-india-china-border-breakthrough-ladakh-standoff-patrolling-deal-resolution-2625358-2024-10-30) in resolving the India-China border dispute. Nonetheless, the improvement in the India-China relationship may also benefit the United States by reducing the risk of conflict in South Asia and allowing for Washington to focus on China’s role in other regions around the world. ## What About Pakistan? The India-China border agreement has a mixed impact on Pakistan **.** Reduced tensions between New Delhi and Beijing facilitate an environment of peace in the region, which bodes well for Islamabad. However, the success of India’s negotiations with China does not indicate a similar improvement in the India-Pakistan relationship. The possibility of any analogous border agreement on the LOC is fraught with challenges that are multifaceted and deeply entrenched, primarily revolving around territorial disputes over Kashmir and cross-border terrorism. However, the success of India’s negotiations with China does not indicate a similar improvement in the India-Pakistan relationship. The possibility of any analogous border agreement on the LOC is fraught with challenges that are multifaceted and deeply entrenched, primarily revolving around territorial disputes over Kashmir and cross-border terrorism. Despite Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar’s [recent visit to Islamabad](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/s-jaishankars-historic-visit-to-pakistan-sco-meeting-internet-calls-him-boss-the-real-hero/articleshow/114249012.cms?from=mdr) for a conclave SCO meeting, his visit did not pertain to the bilateral relationship and has not shown any signs of purposefully engaging to resolve the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and other lingering bilateral issues. Strategically, India’s construction of the [INS Varsha, the development of K-4 naval capabilities in the eastern coast](https://issi.org.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IB_Abu_Hurrairah_July_15_2024.pdf), and its cooperation with the U.S.’s Indo-Pacific Strategy raises concerns for Pakistan’s strategic threat perceptions regardless of the border agreement. Nonetheless, reduced tensions on the LAC may ease India’s threat perceptions of a two-front challenge from China and Pakistan, which could indirectly suggest greater Indian appetite for enduring crisis risks on the LOC. In conclusion, the recent India-China border agreement is a positive development in the short term that provides a framework for de-escalation and the resumption of normal patrolling activities. However, the long-term prospects for peace and stability will depend on continuous efforts to address the underlying issues and build a durable framework for conflict resolution and cooperation. The world awaits to see if this agreement will be a harbinger of a new era in India-China relations or just another interlude in a long-standing rivalry. ## Recent & Related Video [South Asian Perspectives on Critical Cyber Threats, Law, and Norms](https://www.stimson.org/2025/south-asian-perspectives-on-critical-cyber-threats-law-and-norms/) Commentary [SAV Q&A with Bidushi Dhungel: Nepal’s Political Revolution and Quest for a More Equitable Future](https://www.stimson.org/2025/sav-qa-with-bidushi-dhungel-nepal/) Commentary [Implications of the SCO Summit Week in China](https://www.stimson.org/2025/implications-of-the-sco-summit-week-in-china/) Daniel Markey • Asfandyar Mir • Peter Slezkine... ## About Stimson ## Transparency ## People ## Contact General - 202.223.5956 - 1211 Connecticut Ave NW, 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20036 - Fax: 202.238.9604 Media Inquiries - 202.478.3437 - [Caiti Goodman](https://www.stimson.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3b585c54545f565a557b484f52564854551554495c) - [Communications Dept.](https://www.stimson.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9bf8f4f6f6eef5f2f8faeff2f4f5e8dbe8eff2f6e8f4f5b5f4e9fc) - [News & Announcements](https://www.stimson.org/about/stimson/media-announcements/) Copyright The Henry L.

In April, a widespread [power outage in Spain](https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/blackout/28-april-2025-iberian-blackout/) showed how quickly a nation’s energy infrastructure can be stressed. If a similar outage were to occur in the UK and stretch beyond 24 hours, the effects would escalate from inconvenience to systemic risk for financial services: payment flows could seize up, trading could be disrupted, and millions could lose access to banking services. For a sector built on real-time settlement and continuous connectivity, this is a severe but plausible scenario that deserves active monitoring. These vulnerabilities are amplified by mounting pressures on the UK’s power system. Electricity demand is climbing, driven in part by the growth of data centres, the electrification of transport and heating. Much of the grid infrastructure is aging, with uneven investment in upgrades. Winter peaks are increasingly shaped by extreme weather, and longer spells of low wind or sun can tighten operating margins just as demand surges. Findings Against this backdrop, the Swift Centre Forecasters were asked: **_Will the UK experience an electricity blackout lasting over 24 hours before December 31st 2026 that severely disrupts financial services?_** ## **Findings** On average, the Swift Centre forecasters put the probability of the UK experiencing a blackout lasting more than 24 hours before the end of 2026 at 7.8%. This means roughly a one-in-twelve chance of a systemic disruption to the UK’s financial services within the next two years. And this figure only covers the most severe case – outages lasting more than 24 hours. Shorter blackouts, which can still disrupt payments and trading, are supposedly more plausible. Behind this headline number, views diverged. A group clustered at the higher end, around 17-18%, emphasising severe weather and infrastructure fragility. Others leaned much lower (0.5-5%), pointing to the historical rarity of such long outages and the grid’s proven resilience. The gap reflects different judgments about what could plausibly drive a multi-day blackout, as well as competing views on the UK’s ability to withstand shocks. Those on the lower end argued that blackouts lasting more than 24 hours are historically rare in the UK and that the grid has generally proven resilient. One noted: “ _We have events that can be considered ‘major’ UK blackouts… However, few if any lasted longer than 12 hours_.” Another gave a 2% estimate but said this would rise to 5-10% if shorter outages were considered. In their view, the most plausible drivers of a multi-day blackout would be supply shortages rather than extreme weather. While storms and floods regularly cause localised outages, these are usually resolved in under 24 hours. By contrast, past rolling blackouts were linked to fuel constraints, and the UK’s relatively small gas storage capacity still represents a vulnerability: > “ _We currently store 12 days’ worth of winter gas demand, compared with 89 days in Germany and 103 days in France._” Even so, they judged that interconnectors to Europe and imports from the U.S. and Middle East make outright shortages unlikely in the forecast period. Cyberattacks were also downplayed as a plausible trigger. The grid remains relatively isolated from the internet, and past incidents (such as the [2019 lightning strike](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d96100340f0b61743bd4cc3/20191003_E3C_Interim_Report_into_GB_Power_Disruption.pdf)) have been rapidly contained: > “A _long, nationwide blackout won’t occur, in spite of the Grid’s finer supply and response time margins._” Others in the low-probability camp nudged their estimates slightly higher (up to 5%), emphasising recent close calls and the challenges of managing a system with more variable renewables. One observed that “ _risk is higher than in the past with increased share of volatile renewables._” Another pointed to the [near-blackout in January 2025](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/09/britain-came-within-whisker-blackouts-national-grid/): “ _Such close calls do make one wonder if the system is sufficiently resilient. But at the same time, that the situation at worst would have resulted in planned blackouts of about three hours._” By contrast, those at the higher end placed more weight on weather and infrastructure fragility. One reasoned that “ _blackouts in the UK are not particularly frequent and almost all of them \\[…\\] are related to severe weather,_” and identified 3-6 instances in the past three decades where outages lasted over 24 hours, leading them to a double digit estimate. Another highlighted specific cases – the [2013 Christmas storms](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7c5576e5274a1b0042311a/DECC_-_Festive_disruption_review_-_Final__2_.pdf), [2015 floods](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-35020049), and storms [Arwen (2021)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/storm-arwen-electricity-distribution-disruption-review) and [Eunice (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Eunice#:~:text=The%20UK%20was%20particularly%20hard,km%2Fh)%20were%20recorded.) – and concluded that “ _large towns going out for more than 24 hours is quite common._” A third, giving a 17% probability, focused on infrastructure risk, pointing to [Heathrow’s 18-hour outage in 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-into-the-north-hyde-substation-outage-terms-of-reference) as a sign of weak redundancy: > “ _The recent shutdown of Heathrow due to a substation fire showed a weakness in ability to quickly shift to alternative sources._” They also added a small premium for cyberattacks, accounting for around 1.5% of their estimate. ## **If Winter Bites Harder** Forecasters were also asked to assess how their probabilities would change in the event of a severe winter in 2025 or 2026. In this scenario, severe winter was defined as record-low temperatures, low renewable generation, tight gas supplies, or extreme storms. Across the board, forecasters agreed that harsh winter conditions would make a long blackout more likely. Most described the effect as roughly doubling their baseline estimate, though the results varied widely depending on where they had started from. Justifications also differed: some emphasised the compounded stress on gas and renewables, others the physical damage caused by storms, and a few highlighted the risk of global energy supply constraints. For some, the increase was modest in absolute terms. One forecaster, for example, raised their probability from 2% to 4%, explaining: > “ _Even given a severe winter, I think the probability is very low as long as parts of the large town or region have power restored in under 24 hours, so I'm increasing my estimate by only two percentage points._” Another echoed this view, stressing that “ _Individual weather events like blizzards can cause blackouts without mounting to an extreme winter, so I go with a moderate increase._” Others arrived at higher final estimates. One calculated that roughly “ _47% of years with a major outage… would have resolved positively_” under the severe winter condition, leading them to double their baseline estimate to 40%. Another, who considered the combined risks of high winds, low temperature, major snow or ice storm, argued that resilience would be lower in such circumstances: > “ _Even the loss of a couple of power stations would be a major concern to the UK’s power grid._” They concluded that the probability would be about double their baseline, at 9.8%. Several forecasters pointed to infrastructure fragility and gas reliance as the key vulnerabilities exposed by severe winter conditions. One noted: > “ _The UK increasingly relies on natural gas and renewables. Given such reliance, a period of extreme cold along with low winds could \\[cause\\] selective power outages_.” Another cited National Energy System Operator projections showing “ _the strongest electricity operational margins for the UK grid since 2019,_” but still allowed for the possibility that an unusually cold winter could coincide with global demand pressures and LNG import shortages, settling on a 20% estimate. A final forecaster placed their probability at 25%, reasoning that while severe weather is rare in the UK, it can be very difficult to repair quickly when it does occur: > “ _Ice storms are very rare in the UK, but if they occur, can be devastating to power lines and time-consuming to repair. … I expect that loss of power to a medium-sized city for 24 hours is a relatively low bar and would be difficult to solve without repairs of numerous transmission lines._” ## **Knock-On Effects on Banking Services** Forecasters were also asked to estimate the likelihood that such a blackout would prevent at least 100,000 people in the UK from accessing their bank accounts before 2027. All forecasters judged this outcome to be plausible, with estimates ranging from 30% to 75% and averaging 58%. That implies better than even odds that a major blackout would leave more than 100,000 people unable to access their bank accounts. While confidence levels varied, the consensus was clear: a prolonged outage would almost certainly disrupt financial services on a large scale. At the top end, one forecaster assigned a 75% probability, arguing that the scale of disruption in a 24-hour+ blackout would inevitably capture this many people. Others supported this view with slightly lower estimates. One (62%) explained: > “ _If it lasts for more than 24 hours, it’s likely a nationwide blackout… This very likely means that more than 100,000 people would be unable to access their bank accounts or make payments for at least 12 hours._” Another (63%) stressed that “ _branches and ATMs would naturally be down… The last break point could be the one that matters the most, since an increasing number of people rely on the internet to bank._” Several other forecasters converging around the 50-60% range, emphasised that mundane banking services would fail under these conditions. One wrote: > “ _Should a blackout happen, just about everyone affected by a blackout will lose online access to bank accounts. The main banks may function OK for some time but \\[the\\] majority of the cashpoints will be down. And of course 99% of stores of all kinds will not be able to receive card payments._” Another added that “ _even for those with access to banking by phone app and laptop, cell tower operation, internet service, and the ability to recharge devices are likely to put the number over 100,000._” The only forecaster at the lower end (30%) argued that the internet is not always disabled during power outages, and that people might continue using phones and other battery-operated devices, limiting the number directly affected. Despite these differences, the consensus was clear: once a 24-hours blackout occurs, cascading failures across ATMs, payment systems, telecommunications, and local infrastructure make it highly likely that at least 100,000 people will lose access to their bank accounts. ## **Conclusion** Forecasters judged a multi-day UK blackout to be relatively unlikely – in the single digits under normal conditions – yet the aggregated estimate of 7.8% (with highs of 18%) is still concerning. For a risk that could paralyse payments, trading, and customer access to banking services, even single-digit probabilities amount to a material threat. The risk also rises further under severe winter conditions, with several forecasters effectively doubling their baseline estimates in that scenario. And the consensus was clear: if such a blackout were to occur, the impact on the financial system would be severe.

The International Energy Agency did not mince its words when, in February this year, it laid out the stark challenges facing electricity systems around the world. Global annual investment in [power](https://www.ft.com/electric-power) transmission alone will need to more than double, from about $140bn in 2023 to as high as $300bn in the mid-2030s, if the world is to meet rising demand for power and emissions reduction targets. “Around 1.5mn kilometres of new transmission lines have been built worldwide over the last decade, but inadequate transmission remains a major constraint on power system development, electrification and energy security,” say IEA analysts. China, which has a large and growing industry of electricity equipment and hardware suppliers, is well positioned to capitalise on the sorry state of the world’s electricity transmission system, analysts say. As if to make the IEA’s point, two months on, in late April, [Spain suffered a day-long blackout](https://www.ft.com/content/d790af03-8681-432d-88c8-ed7e980fcf85) that cut power across everything from telecoms and internet networks to businesses and rail systems, with disruptions also hitting neighbouring Portugal. For governments around the world, the outage emphasised the need to address under-investment in electricity networks. This is viewed as necessary to meet not only rising demand for artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and data centres, but also the changing landscape of electricity generation from legacy systems powered by large-scale fossil fuel plants to dynamic and weather-dependent systems using increasing amounts of solar and wind. But the urgent need to modernise the world’s electricity grids, from poles and wires to the sophisticated software for dispatching power at the right place and time, has also highlighted the likely need to work closely with Chinese manufacturers that have found themselves at the forefront of an industry plagued with supply shortages. The Iberian blackout was “just the tip of the iceberg”, says Alicia García-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis, given that the Spanish grid was not in the worst condition compared with other transmission systems in Europe. “This is going to hit everybody.” With western manufacturers unable to keep pace with demand, China is now poised to make power equipment a “hugely profitable export market”, adds García-Herrero. According to Ken Liu, head of China renewables, utilities and energy research at UBS, supply of gas turbines and large power transformers face “severe” bottlenecks globally. Turbines, which have become key to powering AI data centres, now have a lead time of more than three years, from about 18 months normally. While planned levels of transformer manufacturing will only meet half of new demand just from Europe and the US. Global demand for distribution transformers — used to step down high-voltage electricity from a power grid to flow into factories, businesses, data centres or residential areas — is likewise expected to remain robust, Liu says, and in excess of what some of the leading western manufacturers have forecast. The IEA has also noted that lead times for direct current cables, used for long-distance transmission lines, extend beyond five years while the price of cables has also nearly doubled since 2019. “The combination of rising component costs, extended procurement lead times, and a significant backlog of orders is contributing to higher project expenses as well as delays,” the agency says in its February report. China is racing against time to avoid blackouts of its own. The country of 1.4bn people is in the middle of a significant [move to decarbonise](https://www.ft.com/content/f86782fa-9f2e-448a-b710-29e787dc9831) its economy, in part via the electrification of the transport and manufacturing sectors. Beijing is sharply increasing spending across the sector. State Grid, which is responsible for about three-quarters of the country’s electricity transmission, for example, plans record spending of Rmb650bn ($89bn) this year alone. But compounding the challenges for China has been power consumption beating forecasts and hitting record highs this year, with increases across the services and industrial sectors as well as from residential demand. “Transmission and distribution, both, are in tough states,” says David Fishman, a Shanghai-based China power sector expert at The Lantau Group, a consultancy. “They are still behind, and I imagine they’ll stay sprinting just to stop falling further behind,” he added. UBS analysts, however, are upbeat on the prospects for a clutch of Chinese manufacturers to benefit from strong export growth including turbine maker Yingliu, and Sieyuan and Sanxing, leading producers of transformers and other power sector equipment. And Fishman was confident that Chinese power equipment manufacturers would be well placed to overcome any current shortfalls in production to meet rising global demand. “As long as the IP \\[intellectual property\\] is Chinese and the barrier is scaling up, then there is no barrier, because that is what China does very well,” he added. The prospect of more and more Chinese-made equipment in grids around the world poses national security risks linked to economic dependence as well as espionage and military threats, western analysts have said. García-Herrero of Natixis expects that while the prospect of more reliance on China will provoke debate in some countries, ultimately nations will need to prioritise shoring up their electricity systems. “It is just how bad the situation is. I’m sure there will be threats from the geopolitical side. But the grid is just so important. Look at what happened to Spain.” [Reuse this content (opens in new window)](https://enterprise.ft.com/en-gb/services/republishing/republish-content-request?ft-content-uuid=49358a6c-7080-44f1-8846-c206a94fd2eb) [CommentsJump to comments section](https://www.ft.com/www.ft.com#comments-anchor) ## Promoted Content ## Explore the series READ MORE [The electrification of everything](https://www.ft.com/reports/electrification) [China poised to benefit as blackout risk rises from Iberia to Siberia](https://www.ft.com/content/49358a6c-7080-44f1-8846-c206a94fd2eb) - [Currently reading:\\ \\ China poised to benefit as blackout risk rises from Iberia to Siberia](https://www.ft.com/content/49358a6c-7080-44f1-8846-c206a94fd2eb) - [Growth of renewable energy heralds the rise of supercables](https://www.ft.com/content/db0a6697-c120-4f72-b876-e7bbc6e1e6e9) - [The reshaping of energy consumption](https://www.ft.com/content/d857c3f0-f23a-4b41-8e12-f6b2014b8ec8) ## Follow the topics in this article - [Electric power](https://www.ft.com/electric-power) Add to myFT - [Renewable energy](https://www.ft.com/renewable-energy) Add to myFT - [Energy crisis](https://www.ft.com/energy-crisis) Add to myFT - [Utilities](https://www.ft.com/utilities) Add to myFT - [Chinese business & finance](https://www.ft.com/chinese-business-finance) Add to myFT ## Comments Close side navigation menu Search the FTSearch [Subscribe for full access](https://www.ft.com/products?segmentId=4526c036-7527-ab37-9a29-0b0403fa0b5f)",

America’s power grid is straining under the weight of a fast-changing energy landscape. Beyond the usual summer hum of air conditioners, power demand is surging from electric vehicle chargers and sprawling new data centers. At the same time, the infrastructure built to deliver reliable electricity is aging and showing its limits. From Texas heatwaves to California blackouts, the warning signs are impossible to ignore. This isn’t a technical challenge—it’s an economic and political reckoning. If the grid fails, it won’t be because we lacked solutions. It will be because we didn’t act quickly enough. ## **A Demand Surge Few Anticipated** For nearly two decades, U.S. electricity demand was flat. Now, consumption is climbing, driven by technologies that arrived faster than planners expected. Artificial intelligence has unleashed a wave of data center construction. These facilities, dense with high-performance servers and cooling systems, are among the most power-hungry assets in the country. In 2023, AI data centers consumed about [4.4% of U.S. electricity](https://iee.psu.edu/news/blog/why-ai-uses-so-much-energy-and-what-we-can-do-about-it), and that share could triple by 2028, according to Penn State’s Institute of Energy and the Environment. Northern Virginia—“Data Center Alley”— [now handles 70% of global internet traffic](https://oxfordamerican.org/oa-now/how-data-center-alley-is-changing-northern-virginia), pushing utilities like Dominion Energy to scramble for capacity. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google warn that a shortage of skilled electricians could delay expansion, with estimates that the U.S. will need [500,000 more electricians](https://www.ciphernews.com/hot-take/500000-electricians/) in the next decade. Electric vehicles, heat pumps, and electrified industry are adding further strain. The Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee projects growth [equivalent to seven Seattle-sized cities](https://www.nwcouncil.org/fs/18720/2024_05_3.pdf) within ten years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. electricity sales to rise from [4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/elec_coal_renew.php), with similar gains to follow. And finally, there’s climate. As extreme heat events multiply, cooling demand in places like Texas and Arizona is surging—driving peak loads to new records. ## **The Supply Gap: Retirements Outpace Replacement** Just as demand is accelerating, the U.S. is retiring some of its most dependable sources of power. [The EIA projects](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64604) 12.3 gigawatts (GW) of capacity will retire in 2025, a 65% jump over 2024. That includes 8.1 GW of coal, such as the 1,800-MW Intermountain Power Project in Utah, plus another 2.6 GW of natural gas. These plants provide round-the-clock power that intermittent sources cannot yet replace. Wind and solar capacity continue to grow, but not fast enough. The Department of Energy’s July 2025 [Resource Adequacy Report](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/DOE%20Final%20EO%20Report%20%28FINAL%20JULY%207%29_0.pdf) warns that only 22 GW of firm generation is expected by 2030—well short of the 104 GW needed for peak demand. Transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays, and slow adoption of long-duration storage compound the problem. Grid operators from PJM, MISO, ERCOT, and others [told Congress bluntly](https://www.powermag.com/nations-power-operators-warn-congress-of-a-coming-reliability-shortfall/) in March 2025: “Demand is accelerating, supply is lagging, and current tools may not be enough to bridge the gap.” ## **Growing Vulnerabilities: Weather, Cyber, and Sabotage** Beyond the supply-demand imbalance, the grid faces mounting risks. Heatwaves, wildfires, and storms are stressing transmission systems nationwide. Events once considered rare—like the 2003 Northeast blackout that hit 50 million people—are now seen as precursors of larger disruptions. As smart grids and distributed resources proliferate, so do digital entry points for hackers. In 2024, [DOE funded 16 cybersecurity projects](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/department-energy-awards-42-million-guard-power-grid-cyber-threats), including Georgia Tech’s AI-based “DerGuard” system to monitor risks in distributed energy. Sabotage at substations and transmission lines is also rising. With more than 160,000 miles of high-voltage lines and 7,300 plants, much of it decades old, the system is a sprawling, exposed target. [Homeland Security now classifies grid protection](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors) alongside nuclear and water infrastructure. ## **Policy Gridlock and Infrastructure Delays** Despite the alarms, policy responses remain sluggish. Jurisdiction is a big part of the problem. Regional transmission operators manage the grid but don’t own generation or lines. Utilities do, while states control siting and permitting. The result is a patchwork that slows progress. As of mid-2024, transmission projects across the U.S. [faced delays](https://www.wapa.gov/supply-chains/) of five to seven years due to permitting hurdles, interconnection bottlenecks, and supply chain constraints. By mid-2025, lead times for large power transformers had stretched beyond 30 months, with some units requiring up to four years for delivery—posing serious risks to grid reliability and expansion. Even bipartisan efforts like the [CIRCUIT Act](https://www.maddox.com/resources/articles/circuit-act)—introduced in February 2025 to incentivize domestic transformer production through a 10% tax credit—remain stalled in committee, despite widespread industry support and urgent supply chain concerns. Meanwhile, subsidies continue to favor intermittent renewables over firm capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act accelerated clean energy deployment, but without parallel investment in balancing technologies, reliability risks grow. ## **What’s Being Done** Federal and private efforts are ramping up, though often as short-term fixes. DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants and issued reliability directives under the Federal Power Act. These measures keep the lights on but do little to build long-term resilience. DOE also aims to increase long-distance capacity 16% by 2030, adding 7,500 miles of new lines. But permitting delays and local resistance remain obstacles. In 2025, [DOE launched $32 million](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/01/15/us-doe-invests-32-million-for-grid-edge-technology-and-smart-charge-management/) in pilot projects for smart EV charging, responsive buildings, and distributed energy integration. These solutions could eventually scale, but utilities and regulators must buy in. ## **Investor Implications: Reliability as a Premium** For investors, grid instability is a risk, but also an opportunity. Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion, and Avangrid are investing billions in grid modernization and diversified generation. Avangrid alone plans $20 billion through 2030 across 23 states. Independent power producers are also benefiting from the shifting landscape. NRG Energy, one of the nation’s largest competitive power suppliers, has seen its shares climb sharply as rising demand boosts wholesale electricity prices. Unlike regulated utilities, NRG and its peers compete in deregulated markets, where higher load growth and tighter capacity directly translate into stronger margins. That dynamic could make competitive generators an overlooked winner in a strained grid environment. Firms like Fluence, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are seeing growing demand for storage and microgrid solutions. Pilot programs backed by DOE may open new markets for software-driven load management. With coal exiting and renewables constrained, power generated by nuclear energy and natural gas retain a “reliability premium.” [Deloitte estimates](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/power-and-utilities/funding-growth-in-us-power-sector.html) the U.S. power sector will need $1.4 trillion in new capital between 2025 and 2030, with similar levels required through 2050. Firms able to supply firm generation or grid services stand to benefit. ## **Conclusion: Crisis or Course Correction?** The U.S. power grid isn’t collapsing—but it is under pressure like never before. Demand growth, baseload retirements, extreme weather, and policy paralysis are colliding to create a fragile system. Whether this moment becomes a crisis or a correction depends on how quickly policymakers, utilities, and investors adapt. The tools exist—firm generation, smart load management, and modern transmission. But without faster coordination and realistic incentives, the U.S. risks trading energy abundance for energy fragility.

After all, it marked the rise of a Hindu woman, celebrated for her work against corruption. However, such an interpretation is extremely superficial and overlooks a crucial factor in serious geopolitical analysis: geography – both physical and human. Nepal is an overwhelmingly Hindu nation, with Muslims making up around 5% of the population. In such a country, any radical uprising or coup is unlikely to come from religious minorities. On the contrary, the only plausible path to radicalization would be through Hindutva nationalism – the extremist political wing of Hinduism, also present in India but institutionally restrained by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. While Modi is often portrayed in the West as a “Hindu radical,” the reality is far more complex. He does rely on Hindutva sentiment for political support, but he governs with caution and moderation. Modi skillfully manages internal pressures and avoids opening external conflict fronts that could destabilize India – as demonstrated by his restrained stance in response to the massacre of Hindus in Bangladesh and the recent war with Pakistan. Nepal’s instability, however, adds another dangerous piece to the problem in India’s immediate neighborhood. First came the ousting of Imran Khan’s moderate government in Pakistan, paving the way for chaos and war. Then, a coup in Bangladesh opened the door to Wahhabi extremism and led to the persecution of Hindus. Now, Nepal becomes a new geopolitical pawn, with the rise of a radicalized force disguised as democratic change. The notion that this scenario benefits India by strengthening Hinduism is short-sighted. In fact, India is being encircled. Nepal’s radicalization not only escalates religious tensions within India – which also has a vast Muslim population – but also opens a new anti-China front in the Himalayan region. Nepalese Hindu nationalists are, in most cases, openly anti-Beijing and could be used as a tool to sabotage Chinese stability in Tibet and western provinces. This is where the key point arises: India and China are rivals, but not existential enemies. Both understand that as long as NATO exists, they need one another. India’s participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) illustrates that both Asian giants grasp the gravity of the threat posed by the Collective West. A weakened India would expose China’s vulnerable southwestern flank – especially if India were to fragment into pro-Western microstates. Likewise, an unstable China would collapse Eurasian containment strategies and inevitably trigger a crisis along Russia’s eastern borders. In short, what is happening in Nepal is not just a local political rearrangement. It is another strategic move in the encirclement of India and China – a direct attempt to destabilize South Asia and, indirectly, the very heart of Eurasia to prevent the consolidation of a multipolar world order. It’s no coincidence that this crisis erupted amid heightened diplomatic tensions between India and the U.S., and even more tellingly, after Modi engaged in deep cooperation initiatives with both China and Russia. As long as NATO remains the world’s dominant imperialist military alliance, the great Eurasian civilizations must join forces, setting aside historical and regional rivalries. The alternative is a cascading collapse. The so-called “democratic coup” in Nepal is a warning: the West understands the stakes – and it’s playing hard to block the rise of a multi-civilizational Eurasian alliance.

REUTERS/Ahmad Masood [Purchase Licensing RightsNew Tab, opens new tab](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead) ChevronChevron By Nita Bhalla NEW DELHI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As meteorologists warned last week of a monster storm ploughing towards India's east coast, the country's disaster preparedness teams snapped into action, pre-positioning emergency response teams and supplies, and evacuating nearly a million people - ultimately saving countless lives. The impressive show of disaster preparedness is thanks in large part to the lessons learnt after a powerful cyclone hit the country and killed 10,000 people in 1999, and the plans implemented in the years since, say aid workers and disaster experts. \"Credit is due to those who have been involved in efforts to reduce the scale of vulnerability to disasters across India,\" said Tom Mitchell, head of climate change at the Overseas Development Institute in London. \"The low loss of life, following the strongest storm ever measured in the Bay of Bengal, would almost certainly not have been possible without learning lessons from previous cyclones and tsunamis that have hit this coastline.\" Cyclone Phailin, India's fiercest storm in 14 years, smashed into the coastline of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha states over the weekend, flooded swathes of farmland and ripped apart tens of thousands of mud-and-thatch homes - but surprisingly, only 15 people have been reported dead. Early warnings which started five days before the storm's arrival, the pre-positioning of food rations and packaged drinking water in shelters, and the orderly - and sometimes forceful - evacuation of close to one million people saved many lives, said aid workers. As Phailin approached, authorities cancelled the holidays of civil servants during the popular Hindu Dussehra festival, deployed disaster response teams with heavy equipment and positioned helicopters and boats for rescue and relief operations. Trains and flights were cancelled, roads barricaded and helplines and control rooms set up. Satellite phones and generators were dispatched to the heads of districts to ensure they remained in contact with the state capital. The army, navy and air force were put on standby, and power and telecoms companies were instructed to be ready to restore damaged infrastructure as soon as possible after the storm. Efforts to save people's livelihoods were also taken. Specific warnings were given to fishermen not to venture out to sea and to put their boats in safe places, while farmers were advised to harvest their standing crops. \"It's nothing short of a miracle that so many lives were spared. We were expecting the worst, but it just shows that all the time and investment put into preparing for such disasters by the authorities, civil society organisations and communities has paid off,\" said Save the Children's Devendra Tak. WAKE-UP CALL India is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, and many of its 1.2 billion people live in areas vulnerable to natural hazards such as floods, cyclones, droughts and earthquakes. The 1999 super cyclone which thrashed Odisha with wind speeds of 300 km per hour - leaving more than a million homeless - was a wake-up call to authorities as well as humanitarian agencies, say disaster experts. With meteorologists warning that climate change will bring more severe natural calamities to the Indian subcontinent, states like Odisha and Andhra Pradesh have since invested heavily in disaster risk reduction projects. Both states have their own disaster management departments and have built hundreds of cyclone shelters across the coast. Technological advances have been made with models that forecasters can use to accurately predict weather for seven days in advance. Humanitarian organisations such as the Indian Red Cross have also played an instrumental role - mobilising thousands of volunteers across the cyclone-prone region who are trained in first aid and can support evacuations and aid distributions. Drills are regularly organised so people know what to do when an alert is issued - locking up their homes, keeping their cattle in safe places and taking only a few clothes and important documents with them. \"Christian Aid and its local partner organisations have been working with the coastal communities in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh for almost two decades and have established an extensive network of disaster management task forces all along the coast,\" said a statement from UK-based charity Christian Aid. \"They have increased the resilience of coastal communities, preparing them for emergencies such as Cyclone Phailin, as well as teaching them about life-saving search and rescue activities, and the availability of stockpiles of emergency relief supplies.\" ELSEWHERE, STILL AT RISK Around 76 percent of India's coastline is prone to cyclones and tsunamis, while 59 percent of the country is vulnerable to earthquakes, 10 percent to floods and river erosion, and 68 percent to droughts. But not all states in India are as prepared as Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, say disaster experts, adding that some have not even established disaster management departments or those that have, are not functioning. For example, unprecedented rainfall in June wreaked havoc across the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, causing rivers and glacier lakes to overflow and triggering massive landslides - a catastrophe that many termed a \"Himalayan Tsunami\". Almost 6,000 missing people are presumed dead, and the devastation has disrupted the lives of two million people - one-fifth of Uttarakhand's population. The failure of state authorities to act on early warnings given by the weather office and organise timely evacuations in the popular Hindu pilgrimage area were blamed for the staggering death toll. The construction of hydroelectric dams, rampant deforestation and the spread of unregulated buildings along river banks worsened the impact, add environmentalists. Experts say more frequent and intense extreme weather events caused by global warming mean countries like India must improve their planning and reduce the potential impact of disasters before they occur. \"Odisha and Andhra Pradesh passed the acid test on cyclone Phailin, but not all of India is that well-prepared,\" said Unni Krishnan, head of disaster response for children's charity Plan International. \"Other states, where millions of people are at risk, also need to have the same level of preparedness.\" Our Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.New Tab, opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html) Share - X - Facebook - Linkedin - Email - Link [Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead) ## Read Next - [article with video](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-court-hears-mitigation-pleas-joshua-wong-other-democrats-2024-07-05/) [Asia Pacificcategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/) [Hong Kong court hears mitigation pleas from Joshua Wong, other democrats](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-court-hears-mitigation-pleas-joshua-wong-other-democrats-2024-07-05/) 11:20 AM UTC · Updated ago - [article with gallery](https://www.reuters.com/world/xi-putin-set-out-ambitions-eurasian-security-club-2024-07-04/) [Worldcategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/) [Xi and Putin set out ambitions for Eurasian security club](https://www.reuters.com/world/xi-putin-set-out-ambitions-eurasian-security-club-2024-07-04/) July 4, 2024 - [article with gallery](https://www.reuters.com/world/firms-weigh-removing-taiwan-staff-china-after-death-penalty-threat-2024-07-04/) [Human Rightscategory](https://www.reuters.com/tags/human-rights/) [Exclusive: Firms weigh removing Taiwan staff from China after death penalty threat](https://www.reuters.com/world/firms-weigh-removing-taiwan-staff-china-after-death-penalty-threat-2024-07-04/) July 4, 2024 - [article with video](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pro-palestine-protestors-scale-roof-australias-parliament-2024-07-04/) [Asia Pacificcategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/) [Four pro Palestine protesters arrested for scaling roof of Australia's parliament](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pro-palestine-protestors-scale-roof-australias-parliament-2024-07-04/) July 4, 2024 [![LSEG Workspace](https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/AE6BNNRLSVAQTFG5XHTC4AV6YI.jpg)](https://www.lseg.com/en/data-analytics/products/workspace?utm_source=reuters.com&utm_medium=articlebanner&utm_campaign=Reuters_ProductPage_Links) ## [WorldChevron](https://www.reuters.com/world/) - ### [Papal enemy Archbishop Vigano found guilty of schism and excommunicated](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/papal-enemy-archbishop-vigano-found-guilty-schism-excommunicated-2024-07-05/) [Europecategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/) · July 5, 2024 · 11:41 AM UTC · ago Italian Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, a fierce ultra-conservative critic of Pope Francis, has been found guilty of schism and excommunicated, the Vatican's doctrinal office said in a statement on Friday. - [Americascategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/) [Argentina appoints Sturzenegger as minister of deregulation](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuador-reinstates-visa-requirement-chinese-travelers-2024-06-18/) 11:41 AM UTC · Updated ago - [Africacategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/) [Kenya's Ruto pledges spending cuts after nationwide protests](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/kenyas-ruto-pledges-government-changes-after-nationwide-protests-2024-07-05/) 11:41 AM UTC · Updated ago - [Europecategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/) [Putin tells Orban he is ready to discuss 'nuances' of Ukraine conflict](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-tells-orban-he-is-ready-discuss-nuances-ukraine-conflict-2024-07-05/) 11:40 AM UTC · Updated ago - [article with gallery](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hungarys-orban-says-no-position-negotiate-between-ukraine-russia-2024-07-05/) [Europecategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/) [Hungary's Orban meets Putin in Moscow, drawing EU rebukes](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hungarys-orban-says-no-position-negotiate-between-ukraine-russia-2024-07-05/) 11:39 AM UTC · Updated ago",

The trade deal has been struck over the US demand for greater access to India's agricultural and dairy market. It wants reduced tariffs on products like corn, soybeans, apples, almonds and ethanol, as well as increased access for US dairy products. New Delhi is, however, resisting these demands as these will have a direct bearing on farmers. But before a US-India deal could be reached, Trump launched a scathing attack on India over New Delhi's business dealings with Russia – Russia launched a war on Ukraine over three years ago. Frustrated over not being able to end the war – as Trump portrays himself as a peacemaker – Trump has started targeting the countries that have business deals with Moscow.

Credit: FOTOGRIN - shutterstock.com A Chinese state-sponsored hacker group called RedNovember has conducted a global espionage campaign targeting critical infrastructure between June 2024 and July 2025, compromising defense contractors, government agencies, and major corporations while exploiting vulnerabilities faster than organizations could deploy security patches. The attacks included breaches of at least two US defense contractors and more than 30 Panamanian government agencies as part of a systematic targeting across the US, Europe, Asia, and South America, according to cybersecurity firm [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/rednovember-targets-government-defense-and-technology-organizations). The threat group deployed the Go-based Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike, and SparkRAT to maintain persistent network access after exploiting flaws in enterprise appliances, researchers said in the report. “The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms,” the report added. Recorded Future’s Insikt Group had previously tracked the activity under the designation TAG-100 before attributing it to Chinese state-sponsored operations. Microsoft also tracks overlapping activity from this group as Storm-2077. ## Systematic exploitation of enterprise network devices RedNovember systematically targeted internet-facing appliances that form the backbone of enterprise network security, successfully compromising SonicWall VPN devices, Ivanti Connect Secure appliances, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, F5 BIG-IP systems, Sophos SSL VPN products, and Fortinet FortiGate firewalls, researchers found. The hackers exploited both recently disclosed vulnerabilities and older flaws that organizations had failed to patch. RedNovember compromised two US defense contractors in April 2025 using CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti appliances – flaws for which patches had been available since January 2024, the report said. A European engine manufacturer that produces aerospace components was breached through its SonicWall VPN device, while multiple law firms fell victim through compromised network appliances, researchers documented. ## 72-hour vulnerability exploitation window RedNovember demonstrated the ability to weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities faster than most organizations could deploy patches, researchers found. When researchers published proof-of-concept code for Check Point VPN vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 on [May 30, 2024](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/), RedNovember was attacking vulnerable systems by June 3. That campaign hit at least 60 organizations across Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the United States within four days, according to the report. Similar patterns emerged with Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, with RedNovember consistently exploiting disclosed vulnerabilities within 72 hours of public exploit code availability, the research showed. ## Open-source tools masked attribution Rather than developing custom malware, RedNovember relied heavily on publicly available tools, including the Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework, and SparkRAT remote access tool, all written in the Go programming language, researchers found. The hackers used variants of the LESLIELOADER tool to deploy SparkRAT on compromised systems, with samples first detected in March 2024, according to the analysis. RedNovember also leveraged legitimate services, including vulnerability scanning tools like PortSwigger’s Burp Suite and VPN services, including ExpressVPN and Cloudflare’s Warp, to manage their infrastructure. “RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution,” researchers explained in the report. ## Global targeting across multiple sectors The group heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, while also conducting surveillance of government agencies across Panama, and targeting entities in Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, the report said. The hackers maintained persistent access to compromised networks for months, with some intrusions lasting from July 2024 through March 2025, according to the research. A Taiwanese IT company remained compromised throughout this period, with researchers tracking communications to Pantegana command-and-control servers. The hacker group also targeted organizations handling sensitive business negotiations, successfully compromising an American law firm involved in debt restructuring for a Chinese company and attempting to breach a major US newspaper, the report found. ## Coordinated timing with geopolitical events Several RedNovember campaigns coincided with significant geopolitical developments, researchers observed. The systematic surveillance of more than 30 Panamanian government agencies occurred just weeks after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an expanded partnership to counter Chinese influence in the canal zone. The targeting of Taiwan facilities, which house both military installations and semiconductor research operations, coincided with Chinese military exercises involving 90 warships around the island in December 2024, the report noted. “The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China,” the researchers wrote. The systematic targeting of internet-facing appliances across multiple vendor platforms indicated that organizations need enhanced monitoring and rapid patch deployment capabilities for network infrastructure devices, the report suggested. RedNovember “will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release,” researchers added in the report.

The island-wide outage, which hit just after 9am local time on Wednesday, is believed to be linked to a malfunction at one of Cuba’s largest thermoelectric plants, the Ministry of Energy and Mines said. ## Recommended Stories list of 4 items - list 1 of 4 [Cuba restores power grid but planned outages to resume amid energy crisis](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/5/cuba-restores-power-grid-but-planned-outages-to-resume-amid-energy-crisis) - list 2 of 4 [Cuba forced to ‘paralyse economy’ amid desperate energy crisis](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/18/cuba-forced-to-paralyse-economy-amid-desperate-energy-crisis) - list 3 of 4 [Photos: Cuba struggles to get energy grid back online after blackout](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/10/19/cuba-struggles-to-get-energy-grid-back-online-after-nationwide-blackout) - list 4 of 4 [Cuba extends workplace, school shutdowns in wake of power blackouts](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/23/cuba-extends-workplace-school-shutdowns-in-wake-of-power-blackouts) end of list The ministry said crews had been dispatched to build a microsystem capable of providing basic services, and were prioritising the return of electricity to essential sites such as hospitals and food production plants. On Thursday, the national electricity company said power was restored to 11 of Cuba’s 15 provinces. The Cuban Electric Union said on X that 79.4 percent of households in the capital Havana have electricity again after a blackout that lasted nearly 24 hours. “The SEN (National Electric System) has been reconnected, with restoration still pending” in four provinces, the company added. Earlier, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero also made an appearance on state TV at Cuba’s state-run power company, asking Cubans for their trust and promising that electricity would be restored gradually. Cuba’s worsening economic and energy crisis has led to repeated daily blackouts and full grid outages. In March, a [breakdown](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/15/huge-power-outage-in-cuba-leaves-millions-in-darkness) at a substation in Havana led to rolling blackouts across the island, with three more blackouts [occurring](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/4/millions-without-power-as-cuba-hit-by-another-nationwide-blackout) late last year. Across Havana on Wednesday, traffic lights were down as people scurried around to buy groceries and basic goods before dark. Pumps supplying the capital’s apartments with water rely on electricity. Havana resident Danai Hernandez [told](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2025/9/10/cuba-hit-with-fifth-nationwide-blackout-in-less-than-a-year#flips-6379047661112:0) Al Jazeera she had left work to prepare her home for the blackout. “We just have to wait. There’s no other choice,” she said. “We’re cooking with wood and charcoal, so we have to adjust our schedules,” resident Ernesto Gutierrez told Al Jazeera. “It’s complicated, stressful, and frustrating, too.” Cuba’s energy supply crisis has deteriorated in recent years because of US sanctions, which prevent it from holding sufficient foreign currency to upgrade or repair fast-ageing plants that have been in use for more than three decades. Havana has tried to fill the gap by renting floating Turkish power ships and installing Chinese-funded solar parks. Some wealthier families have installed rechargeable devices and solar panels in their homes. Still, the blackouts have prompted rare [protests](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/18/cuba-hundreds-protest-long-blackouts-tight-economy), with crowds flooding the second-largest city of Santiago last year.",

This year, a leading engineering society [graded](https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/civil-engineering-magazine/issues/magazine-issue/article/2025/05/the-urgent-need-for-energy-infrastructure-improvements) the country’s energy system a D+; 70 percent of transmission lines are more than 25 years old, 55 percent of transformers are near end of life, and the average lead time for new transformers is over a year. On top of all that, hotter and more frequent heat waves are degrading the grid. Despite these deficiencies, new demands are being made of the system, from massive new “hyperscale” data centers and more electric vehicle charging stations to the onshoring of manufacturing. Additionally, as temperatures rise and cyberattacks boosted by artificial intelligence (AI) become more potent, the United States needs to invest in a more resilient grid—or risk an energy insecure future. #### Past and future risks to grid reliability Threats to electricity systems include many new and evolving digital and physical risks to companies, cities, and individuals, including disruptions to technological and communications services. On the physical side, floods, fires, and extreme heat events, which are [increasingly posing physical threats](https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/weather-related-power-outages-rising) to energy infrastructure. Digital threats come in the form of ransomware and other cyberattacks, and sometimes arise simply out of the enormous complexity of today’s systems. For example, the [2024 CrowdStrike disruption](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/delta-crowdstrike-global-it-outage-explained)—which was caused by a faulty software update that crashed Windows systems worldwide—affected US Department of Energysystems as well as those at a number of [electric utilities](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/power-grid/outage-management/widespread-technology-outage-disrupts-flights-banks-media-outlets-and-companies-around-the-world/), and stranded or otherwise impacted 1.3 million airline passengers. When these events occur, disruptions to commerce and society follow and highlight the obligations that infrastructure planners and defenders have to limit harm from such incidents—obligations that simply cannot be deferred. And yet, upgrades to some of the most important parts of US critical infrastructure arebeing deferred. Today, on average, large US grid transformers, which are essential to electricity reliability, are [past their designed lifespan](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/EXEC-2022-001242%20-%20Large%20Power%20Transformer%20Resilience%20Report%20signed%20by%20Secretary%20Granholm%20on%207-10-24.pdf), and the backlog for replacements is [often three years or more](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/reshore-electrical-equipment-backlogs-transformer-breaker-nema/749265/). Grid operators—and all who depend on the grid—are forced to rely on this old equipment. Meanwhile, [rising temperatures are aging grid components faster](https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/topics-and-risk-dialogues/climate-and-natural-catastrophe-risk/impact-of-climate-on-electric-grids.html#:~:text=Global%20warming%20projections%20of%202,(%3E%204%C2%B0C)) by increasing chemical and mechanical stress on them, which leads to reduced efficiency, faster degradation, and increased failure rates. In addition to these long-standing challenges, three major trends have recently emerged that place additional pressure on the electric system: electricity-hungry, AI-powering data centers; the increasing number of electric vehicles and charging stations; and the electrification of everything, perhaps best represented by [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/heat-pumps-keep-widening-their-lead-on-gas-furnaces) replacing oil and gas-burning furnaces. At the same time, the nation is confronted with operational risks and constraints that US grid managers are struggling mightily to manage, such as how to handle increasing shares of non-dispatchable renewable generation as well as rapid policy changes like executive orders to keep coal plants running and restart shuttered nuclear plants. #### Disruption drives agile solutions There is a way forward, inspired by past grid failures and wartime emergencies. When challenged with disruptions, grid operators have not only responded with agility but also applied lessons learned to greatly reduce the potential for future cascades. The Northeastern blackout of 2003, for example, provided a major wake-up call. It affected [50 million people and cost about $6 billion](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2003-blackout-five-years-later/). While numerous improvements followed, three in particular did much to improve the [US grid’s resilience posture](https://www.energy.gov/oe/articles/blackout-2003-blackout-final-implementation-report) via enhanced communications: the installation by the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Committee (NERC) of a new conference bridge to greatly enhance communications during crises; the creation of a new set of procedures and protocols for reliability coordinator hotline calls; and enhancements to the decentralized system data exchange network with automated hourly uploads of outage data. Another example—a far more devastating one—is Russia’s targeting of energy infrastructure in Ukraine. Under heavy attacks aimed at knocking out civilian infrastructure, Ukrainians, in a show of unity, deployed backup generators and battery packs in unprecedented numbers, adhered to strict schedules for electricity usage set by the utilities, and—as much as possible—decentralized power generation. Although the United States is not at war, the impacts of climate change and cyberattacks could have similar effects on infrastructure and require similar solutions. To address the growing demand for electricity, the United States must generate and deliver much greater quantities of electricity reliably, safely, and securely, all while limiting emissions. Enhanced demand management, as practiced with precision in Ukraine, is one tool that may help. #### Anticipating future challenges The truth is that the US electric system is not operating the way it was designed. That’s because its developers did not anticipate the arrival of such dynamism. Meeting new challenges will require leadership and collective will, and for society to make itself more resilient by preparing in advance for more and longer-duration outages with backup generators and microgrids. To meet the challenges of a future where energy demand keeps rising, warming temperatures place new pressures on critical infrastructure, and cyber criminals threaten to cause massive disruption, the United States must leverage its collective imagination to rally its businesses and citizens to prepare for a less reliable grid. This is accomplished, in part, by full-scale exercises like NERC’s biennial [GridEx](https://www.nerc.com/pa/CI/ESISAC/Pages/GridEx.aspx) series, as well as through regional resilience summits. The property of resilience isn’t required until there is scarcity, a stressor, or other forms of adversity. It comes into play when an entity doesn’t have all that it needs or is under assault, but, by prior preparation, is not defeated. _[Andy Bochman](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) is the senior grid strategist for Idaho National Laboratory’s National and Homeland Security directorate._ ## About the author Former fellow ### [Andy Bochman](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) [Former Nonresident Senior Fellow](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) [Global Energy Center](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/our-programs/global-energy-center/) [Cybersecurity](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/cybersecurity/) [Energy & Environment](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/energy-environment/) ## Stay Connected #### Sign up for PowerPlay, the Atlantic Council’s bimonthly newsletter keeping you up to date on all facets of the energy transition ## related content [EnergySourceAug 28, 2025\\ \\ **Overheated and underbuilt: How to fortify the US grid in the face of heat waves** \\ \\ ByFrank Willey\\ \\ As demand for electricity rises across the United States—and in the Mid-Atlantic in particular—to cool homes and power data center growth, so does its cost.

To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question.

Cyclone Hudhud, earthquake in China, monsoon floods in India and Pakistan led to loss of over 7000 lives in Asia in 2014, with a total cost of disaster events estimated at USD 52 billion. Globally, total economic losses from all disaster events were USD 110 billion in 2014, where Asia contributed 47% to the total global losses. Out of the total loss, only USD 5.2 billion worth of losses were insured in Asia. There still lies a big protection gap with the lack of insurance cover in many countries in Asia. Economic development, population growth, a high concentration of assets in exposed areas and a changing climate are increasing the economic cost of natural disasters. These, if not accompanied by a commensurate increase in insurance penetration, will likely result in a widening protection gap over the long term. [Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6cbsSDuMRmPCIgXS2t) Heavy monsoon in northern India and Pakistan In early September, monsoon rains in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir in India and the neighbouring region in Pakistan resulted in the worst flooding in 60 years. At least 665 perished and over 200 000 houses were destroyed. However, the rural communities were hit harder as the floods came at harvest time for rice and apple crops, the livelihood of many farmers. Together, the total losses in India and Pakistan were USD 5.9 billion, and insured losses were at least USD 0.2 billion.The total losses from the destruction of housing in India were at USD 4.4 billion. Cyclone Hudhud caused the largest loss from a tropical cyclone The biggest storm of the Pacific and Indian Ocean season was Cyclone Hudhud in October. Hudhud made landfall near the port city of Visakhapatnam in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh with winds of up to 200 km/124 miles per hour and a storm surge of up to three metres in some areas. The storm brought heavy rains and flooding in neighbouring states also. With a population of 2 million, Visakhapatnam is the third largest city on India's east coast. The total losses were estimated at USD 7 billion, the largest of all natural catastrophes in the world in 2014. However, the insured losses were a fraction of the total at just USD 0.6 billion. The cyclone claimed 68 lives but the number could have been much higher. Early warning and evacuation of up to 400 000 people ahead of the storm saved many lives. ### Also Read [**Asia Pack reports standalone net loss of Rs 0.12 crore in the December 2014 quarter**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/asia-pack-reports-standalone-net-loss-of-rs-0-12-crore-in-the-december-2014-quarter-115021001278_1.html) [**Asia Pack reports standalone net loss of Rs 0.09 crore in the September 2014 quarter**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/asia-pack-reports-standalone-net-loss-of-rs-0-09-crore-in-the-september-2014-quarter-114111300121_1.html) [**Reuters poll - Asia easing views hurt FX sentiment**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/reuters/reuters-poll-asia-easing-views-hurt-fx-sentiment-115020500537_1.html) [**Asia Pack to hold board meeting**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/asia-pack-to-hold-board-meeting-114110600357_1.html) [**Asia Pack to hold board meeting**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/asia-pack-to-hold-board-meeting-115013100492_1.html) [**US to offer smart transport solutions for Allahabad, Ajmer and Visakhapatnam**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/us-to-offer-smart-transport-solutions-for-allahabad-ajmer-and-visakhapatnam-115040900957_1.html) [**Indian Railways' Freight Loading Up By 4.18 Per Cent During Fiscal 2014-15**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/indian-railways-freight-loading-up-by-4-18-per-cent-during-fiscal-2014-15-115040900956_1.html) [**Shri Rajiv Pratap Rudy Launches Human Resource and Skill Requirement Reports for 24 Priority Sectors**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/shri-rajiv-pratap-rudy-launches-human-resource-and-skill-requirement-reports-for-24-priority-sectors-115040900771_1.html) [**Ind-Ra: Decline in Gas Prices to Drive a Marginal Reduction In Urea Subsidy**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/ind-ra-decline-in-gas-prices-to-drive-a-marginal-reduction-in-urea-subsidy-115040900769_1.html) [**Union Tourism Minister Dr Mahesh Sharma launches the 'Visit Kerala 2015' Initiative of Kerala Tourism**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/union-tourism-minister-dr-mahesh-sharma-launches-the-visit-kerala-2015-initiative-of-kerala-tourism-115040900768_1.html) Bulk of convective storm activity in India and Bangladesh In Asia, the bulk of the severe convective storm activity occurs in India and Bangladesh, most often in the pre-monsoon period from March-May. The storms are classified by wind speed, with speeds of 42 meters per second/151 km per hour or higher referred to as tornadoes, and below that as nor'westers. The four deadliest tornadoes on sigma records were all in Bangladesh and the fifth and sixth in India. Total economic losses were lower in 2014 Global insured losses from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters were USD 35 billion in 2014, down from USD 44 billion in 2013 and well below the USD 64 billion-average of the previous 10 years. Around 12,700 people lost their lives in all disaster events, down from as many as 27,000 in 2013, making it one of the lowest numbers ever recorded in a single year. The number of victims of disaster events in 2014 was one of the lowest recorded. Improvements in early warning systems and emergency preparedness meant fewer victims than otherwise may have been. Progress in local prevention and mitigation measures to strengthen resilience will be a key variable in total victim numbers in the future, especially if climate change leads to more frequent natural catastrophe events. **_Powered by_ Capital Market - Live News** [Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.

In a fiery post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said that while India is a “friend”, it has imposed some of the “highest tariffs” on the United States and maintained “obnoxious” non-monetary trade barriers. The announcement comes after a slew of negotiated trade frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia — all of which Trump said would open markets for American goods while enabling the US to raise tax rates on imports. Donald Trump's 25% tariff announcement was met with strong criticism from Opposition leaders. Indian trade bodies have also voiced disappointment, with leaders in India’s gems and jewellery sector warning of short-term disruptions, job losses, and higher prices for US buyers, reported ANI.

The currency market had clearly priced this eventually as the USDINR pair moved by more than 70 paise today. The exact details of the tariffs on the exempted items such as pharma and the ones that were charged at a differential rate such as iron, steel and auto is unknown as of now, but inclusion of pharma into tariffs should be incremental negative for India’s exports as US accounts for more than 30% of India’s pharma exports. If no deal is signed by Sept-October, we see a downside to full year GDP growth estimate for India by 20 bps,” says Garima Kapoor, Economist and Executive Vice President, Elara Capital. 31 Jul 2025, 06:33:27 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: Trump says India willing to cut tariffs ‘substantially’ “We had a tremendous trade deficit.

They have one of the highest tariffs in the world. Now, they are willing to cut it very substantially. But we will see what happens. We are talking to India now. We will see what happens.

We will have many more options for exporting to other countries. It will hurt us as the US is a big market for the Gem and Jewelery industry.

India exports jewellery to the entire world. If we look at the numbers, trade worth nearly 9 billion dollars takes place with the US. This will be 100 percent affected.

    "full_text": "Search # Is India being forced closer to China and other BRICS nations by US tarrifs? / MOFA - People's Republic of China By bno Chennai OfficeAugust 22, 2025 India’s economic relationship with China has evolved in uneven but persistent ways since 2005, when both sides agreed that boundary disputes would not obstruct broader cooperation. That principle allowed trade to flourish despite recurring standoffs in Ladakh, Doklam, and Galwan. According to a new report by _Carnegie India_, [bilateral trade](https://www.intellinews.com/india-china-move-to-restart-border-trade-after-five-year-gap-396286/?source=india) grew from $17bn in 2005 to nearly $120bn by 2024, with China becoming India’s largest trading partner and the trade deficit swelling to almost $100bn. Attempts to narrow the gap by boosting Indian exports ran into Chinese non-tariff barriers in pharmaceuticals, IT, and procurement, leaving India structurally dependent on Chinese goods. Through these years, even the most violent clashes along the Line of Actual Control did not dent the trajectory of imports; only global shocks such as the 2008 financial crisis, the 2018 trade war, and the 2020 pandemic briefly slowed the deficit’s rise. Investment flows tell a more complex story. Chinese commitments in manufacturing and infrastructure spiked after 2014, riding Xi Jinping’s outbound investment liberalisation and Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” campaign. According to the _Carnegie India_ report, big-ticket deals, such as Fosun’s acquisition of Gland Pharma, signalled growing comfort with cross-border capital. But momentum was cut short by Beijing’s clampdown on outbound flows in 2016 and India’s abrupt policy pivot in 2020 after Galwan. The introduction of mandatory screening for investments from land-bordering countries effectively shut down new Chinese capital. Venture investment, which had funneled billions into India’s booming internet economy, was also caught in the crossfire. By 2019, nearly two-thirds of India’s unicorns counted Chinese investors, but the subsequent app bans and policy shifts triggered rapid unwinding. What was once a deepening digital partnership was dismantled within half a decade, leaving only a few residual stakes by 2025. Public procurement emerged as another battleground. A July 2020 order barred bidders from border-sharing countries without special clearance, effectively targeting Chinese construction and engineering firms. While this halted new government contracts, ongoing projects continued to generate billions in revenue for Chinese companies, and Indian contractors still relied heavily on Chinese input for railways and power equipment. This contradiction highlighted the limits of punitive procurement policies in a market where domestic substitutes remain underdeveloped. The broader calculus grew even more complicated in 2025 as India’s relationship with the US has hit turbulence during Donald Trump’s second term. Early in the year, both sides announced ambitious trade targets, but optimism soured quickly. Trump imposed steep tariffs on Indian exports under the banner of “reciprocity,” escalating the measures within weeks. He further linked a hike in tariff to penalties on India’s continued imports of discounted Russian oil, casting the issue as one of strategic loyalty. New Delhi dismissed the tariffs as unjustified and bristled at Washington’s attempts to dictate its energy policy. The trade war spilled into defense, with reports of procurement delays feeding speculation about a deeper chill in ties. The friction with Washington also carried political consequences at home. Modi’s government, once keen to frame India as a natural US partner in countering China, now faced a difficult balancing act. Public opinion turned skeptical of the reliability of American commitments, while business lobbies fretted over lost export markets. The sudden reversal in tone from Washington reinforced India’s instinct to hedge, looking beyond its Quad partnership to [options within BRICS](https://www.intellinews.com/the-unintended-consequence-of-trump-s-tariffs-is-pushing-brics-together-396138/?source=india) and other multilateral formats. For Beijing, the cracks in the US-India relationship presented an opening to soften its own posture and explore areas of cooperation despite the lingering shadow of Galwan. Taken together, these dynamics underscore the paradox at the heart of India’s economic statecraft. Trade with China remains indispensable but lopsided. Investment ties can be throttled or revived depending on political calculations. Procurement restrictions reveal dependency even when couched in national security terms. And now, India must contend with an uncertain partner in Washington, where tariff wars and energy disputes have cast doubt on the stability of what was once touted as a defining partnership. The result is an India forced to refine its playbook, seeking flexibility, developing layered tools of retaliation and deterrence, and ensuring that neither neighbor nor ally can dictate the terms of its economic future.

Year after year we hear of the same hazards seemingly striking in the same places, [be it floods in northern India or Pakistan](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/6304/war-is-boring-afghan-forces-deploy-for-pakistan-flood-relief), droughts in the Horn of Africa or typhoons in the Philippines. Yet, far from the media glare, localized and low-intensity recurrent disasters wear down the resilience of communities around the world through displacement and the loss of livelihoods. Unlike in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2005 Pakistan earthquake or [the 2010 Haiti earthquake](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/6089/haiti-relief-aid-comes-with-sovereignty-setback-attached), no foreign military assistance has been requested to respond to natural disasters in the past three years—nor forcefully offered, as happened after Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar in 2008. Nor did any disaster claim tens of thousands of lives in 2012. But even in the absence of “mega-disasters,” the human and financial consequences are massive: More than 30 million people were displaced worldwide by natural disasters in 2012; the total cost of damages was estimated at $140 billion. Meanwhile, the World Bank warns that the population of large cities exposed to tropical storms and earthquakes will more than double, from 680 million in 2000 to 1.5 billion in 2050. ## Keep reading for free Already a subscriber?

Studies indicate that natural disaster losses equate up to 2 percent of India’s GDP and up to 12 percent of federal government revenues. About 5,700 kilometers of India’s coastline is exposed to severe cyclones and approximately 40% of India’s population lives within 100 km of the coastline. Analyzed data for the period 1980-2000 indicates that on an average, annually, 370 million people are exposed to cyclones in India. The aim of the project (NCRMP-I) is to improve early warning and communication systems; enhance capacity of local communities to respond to disasters; improve access to emergency shelters, evacuation, and protection against cyclone related hazards such as wind storms, flooding and storm surge in high risk areas; and strengthen disaster risk management capacities at the central, state and local levels. The program is expected to include at least three phases. Phase I includes the states of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Phase II will be open to the remaining high risk states or other coastal states that are ready to join. Rest of the coastal states will be covered under phase III. Each of the new phases will be appraised and approved separately to confirm the implementation readiness. This phased approach will help incorporate lessons from the earlier phases as well as include new ideas and advancements in technology in the management of risks. _“As climate change and variability become more pronounced, hazard events are set to grow, both in terms of frequency and intensity. Globally, the understanding of the role of disaster risk mitigation and preparedness initiatives in reducing the overall impacts of a disaster, has grown,”_ said **N.V.V. Raghava, World Bank Senior Infrastructure Specialist and Project Team Leader.** _“The project aims to mitigate the risks and vulnerability of coastal communities to cyclone and other hydrometeorological hazards by reducing the social, economic and financial impacts of future disasters.”_ India’s response to two of the biggest disasters in this current decade, the Gujarat earthquake and the Asian tsunami, has been efficient and very effective. Through this period, India has made great strides in moving from reactive emergency response to being proactive in implementing disaster preparedness and risk reduction initiatives. India enacted the Disaster Management Act in 2005 and established the National Disaster Management Authority and State Disaster Management Authorities. The credit is provided by the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s concessionary lending arm and has 35 years to maturity and a 10-year grace period. * * * ###### Media Contacts In Delhi Nandita Roy Tel : 91-11-41479220 [nroy@worldbank.org](mailto:nroy@worldbank.org) In Delhi Mohamad Al-Arief Tel : 91-11-41479210 [malarief@worldbank.org](mailto:malarief@worldbank.org) Karina Manasseh Tel : Manasseh [kmanasseh@worldbank.org](mailto:kmanasseh@worldbank.org) * * * ###### RELATED - [India National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (1)](https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P092217?lang=en) * * * * * * - [India](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/india) - [South Asia](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/sar) - [Climate Change](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange) - [Fragility, Conflict and Violence](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/fragilityconflictviolence) Api ![](https://www.worldbank.org/etc/designs/wbr/clientlibs/img/loaderwb.svg) Api ![](https://www.worldbank.org/etc/designs/wbr/clientlibs/img/loaderwb.svg) * * * ###### Newsletters [Welcome](https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/bold-new-worldbankorg)",

This demonstrates how cyber operations have evolved beyond merely gathering intelligence. When first identified by US government partners back in mid-2023, the campaign by the Salt Typhoon group was assessed as a targeted espionage effort against US and allied government systems. It involved stealthy intrusions, selective data theft and probing of networks in a handful of countries. At the time, the effect was thought to be limited and largely confined to government targets. But August 2025 disclosures have shown just how broad the campaign truly has been. The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has [publicly attributed](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/countering-chinese-state-sponsored-actors-compromise-of-networks-worldwide-to-feed-global-espionage-system) the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. They are central to rivalry. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge. The Indo-Pacific is the epicentre of 21st-century competition. China and the US vie for influence, while South Korea, India, Japan and Southeast Asian countries all face mounting digital vulnerabilities. With the digital economy of Southeast Asian nations expected to surpass US$1 [trillion](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/asean-building-trust-digital-economy/) by 2030, growth is driving their prosperity but also compounding risk. Chinese-sponsored hackers have been targeting critical infrastructure for a long time. Suspected Chinese hackers disrupted India’s [port](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/securing-indian-ports-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-and-the-road-ahead) logistics in 2020, and repeated intrusions have targeted Japanese, South Korean and Australian energy grids, telecom systems and government networks. Cyber operations are applied to traditional hotspots—such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait—by threatening disruption without any shots being fired. Beyond the sheer number of cyber incidents, patterns in their objectives distinguish cyber operations in the Indo-Pacific from those in other regions. Three stand out: probing, pressuring, and threshold testing. Probing operations aim to identify and target system vulnerabilities. Chinese threat group APT41 often employs this method. The [group](https://cyberscoop.com/apt41-fireeye-china/) has conducted espionage operations across healthcare, telecoms and government agencies for many years. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has perfected a distinct form of probing: cyber-heists, ranging from the 2016 Bangladesh Bank [hack](https://cyber.uk/areas-of-cyber-security/cyber-security-threat-groups-2/nation-state-hackers-case-study-bangladesh-bank-heist/) to ongoing cryptocurrency thefts that directly fund Pyongyang’s weapons programs. These operations map vulnerabilities and generate funds, while staying below the threshold of conventional war. Australia has been a repeated target of pressuring tactics, with the [breaches](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/reports-and-statistics/annual-cyber-threat-report-2023-2024) of critical infrastructure widely interpreted as signaling that Canberra’s alignment with Washington has costs. Taiwan is another case in point. During its 2024 elections, disinformation campaigns, distributed denial-of-service attacks on government portals, and breaches of media outlets sought to [undermine](https://saferinternetlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Panel-4-Summer.pdf) confidence in the democratic process. These pressures were synchronised with more visible coercion, such as military exercises and air incursions, illustrating how digital operations complement kinetic manoeuvres. Some cyber campaigns appear to be aimed at threshold-testing, blurring the line between espionage and sabotage. In the Vietnam–China cyber [clashes](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/vietnams-securitisation-of-cybersecurity-under-growing-chinese-cyber-threats/) related to South China Sea disputes, Vietnamese hackers allegedly targeted Chinese government websites. Similarly, the 2021 Japan Olympics cyberattacks, which [some](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54600098) attributed to Russian actors, demonstrated how geopolitical rivalries could extend into civilian life. Together, these incidents outline a region where states and non-state actors continually challenge each other’s resolve. Skirmishes might not cause immediate destruction, but they foster digital coercion and raise the risk of escalation. Cyber campaigns are not just harassment; some signal a potential for escalation. Attacks against Taiwan’s government networks have spiked during Chinese military drills, showing how cyber and kinetic tools are increasingly integrated. The danger lies in miscalculation. A ransomware strike that disrupts Japan’s energy grid or South Korea’s financial sector could be interpreted as state-backed aggression, prompting military responses. In cyberspace, where [attribution](https://academic.oup.com/isp/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/isp/ekae022/7903056) is murky and timeframes are compressed, escalation could outrun diplomacy. Repeated incidents also risk normalising cyber coercion as a standard tool of statecraft. If probing and pressure go unchallenged, adversaries will keep pushing until the region faces a full-scale digital confrontation. The Indo-Pacific has become a laboratory for cyber conflict, setting global precedents. Europe, Latin America and Africa should watch closely: today’s coercion in Asia could become tomorrow’s global standard. Cyber skirmishes in the Indo-Pacific mark the cutting edge of strategic competition, where adversaries test limits and normalise coercion. The region’s growing dependence on digital infrastructure, combined with its strategic volatility, makes it a perilous testing ground for cyber conflict globally. The choice is stark: treat these incidents as minor disruptions until one sparks a crisis, or act to strengthen resilience, deepen cooperation and set rules for [responsible](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/curbing-the-cost-of-cybersecurity-fragmentation-an-agenda-for-harmonisation-across-the-indo-pacific/) behaviour in cyberspace. If governments fail, adversaries will decide the thresholds for acceptable action—and by then it may be too late.

The United States’ power grid, once a marvel of 20th-century engineering, is now teetering on the edge of collapse. As demand surges from emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles, an aging infrastructure struggles to keep up. Recent blackouts, escalating costs, and regulatory bottlenecks are painting a picture of a system pushed to its limits. This article explores the crisis, what investors should watch for moving forward, and the ripple effects on everyday consumers, drawing on expert analysis and recent data. ### The Cracks in the Foundation: Why the Grid is Failing ### [Are you Paying High Taxes in New Jersey, New York, or California?](https://energynewsbeat.co/invest/) America’s electrical grid was largely built in the mid-20th century, with much of its transmission and distribution infrastructure now over 50 years old. According to recent reports, the grid faces unprecedented stress from a combination of factors. Electricity demand is skyrocketing: AI data centers alone consumed about 4.4% of U.S. electricity in 2023, a figure projected to triple by 2028. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts electricity sales to climb from 4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025, equivalent to adding the power needs of seven Seattle-sized cities in the next decade. Extreme weather exacerbates the vulnerabilities. Heatwaves in Texas and storms in California have triggered widespread blackouts, reminiscent of the 2003 Northeast blackout that left 50 million people in the dark. Cybersecurity threats and physical attacks on substations are on the rise, with the Department of Homeland Security emphasizing the grid’s critical status. Supply chain issues further compound the problem: lead times for large power transformers have stretched beyond 30 months by mid-2025, delaying essential upgrades. Regulatory hurdles add to the chaos. Transmission projects face five-to-seven-year delays due to permitting issues, jurisdictional disputes between utilities, states, and federal agencies, and policy gridlock. The CIRCUIT Act, introduced in February 2025 to boost domestic transformer production, remains stalled in Congress. Deloitte estimates that the U.S. power sector will require $1.4 trillion in new capital investments between 2025 and 2030 just to maintain reliability. ### Investment Opportunities: Where to Look as the Crisis Unfolds For investors, this gridlock isn’t just a headache—it’s a goldmine of opportunities. The push for modernization and reliability will favor certain sectors over others. Here’s what to watch: ### Behind-the-Meter Solutions and Companies As the centralized grid falters, decentralized “behind-the-meter” technologies—such as battery storage, microgrids, and rooftop solar—are gaining traction. These solutions allow businesses and households to generate and store power independently, reducing reliance on the main grid. Companies like Fluence Energy, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are poised for growth, with demand surging for their storage systems to handle peak loads from data centers and EVs. The Department of Energy (DOE) is allocating $32 million in 2025 for smart EV charging and distributed energy integration, signaling federal support. Investors should eye firms innovating in energy management software and modular storage, as these could see explosive adoption in high-demand regions like Northern Virginia, which handles 70% of global internet traffic. ### Natural Gas and Oil Companies Reliability is king in a strained grid, and fossil fuels still provide the backbone. With coal plants retiring (e.g., Utah’s 1,800 MW Intermountain Power Project), natural gas and oil are stepping in as “bridge” fuels. The DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants to avert shortages. Natural gas firms benefit from their flexibility and lower emissions profile compared to coal, while oil companies could see upticks in backup generation demand. Look for integrated energy giants with strong midstream assets, as they can capitalize on rising wholesale prices in deregulated markets like Texas and Arizona, where cooling demands are surging. Grid UtilitiesTraditional utilities are investing heavily to shore up the system. The DOE aims to boost long-distance transmission capacity by 16% by 2030 through 7,500 miles of new lines. Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion Energy, and Avangrid are leading the charge—Avangrid, for instance, plans $20 billion in investments across 23 states through 2030. These regulated utilities offer stable dividends and exposure to rate hikes as costs pass through to consumers. Independent power producers like NRG Energy are also attractive, profiting from elevated wholesale electricity prices amid supply constraints. In summary, a diversified approach makes sense: behind-the-meter for growth potential, natural gas/oil for reliability plays, and utilities for steady returns. However, risks like regulatory changes and supply chain disruptions loom large—focus on companies with strong balance sheets and innovation pipelines. ### How Consumers Will Feel the Pinch The grid’s woes will hit consumers hardest through higher bills and unreliable service. As utilities pass on upgrade costs, residential electricity prices are climbing nationwide—up about 6.5% from May 2024 to May 2025. Blackouts could become more frequent, disrupting daily life, work, and safety, especially in vulnerable areas prone to weather extremes. The impact varies by state, with some already facing exorbitant rates due to reliance on imported fuels, geography, or high demand. Below is a table of the top 10 most expensive states for residential electricity, based on EIA data for June 2025 (in cents per kWh). These states, often coastal or isolated, illustrate the uneven burden. Consumers in these states could see monthly bills exceed $200 for average usage, prompting shifts toward energy efficiency, solar adoption, or even relocation. Nationally, a Microsoft and Google-backed report warns of a shortage of 500,000 electricians in the next decade, further delaying home upgrades and EV installations. ### Looking Ahead: A Call for Action America’s grid crisis demands urgent investment and policy reform to avert catastrophe. While challenges mount, they also herald a transformation toward a smarter, more resilient energy system. Investors who position themselves wisely—balancing innovation with reliability—stand to benefit, but only if policymakers act swiftly. For consumers, the message is clear: prepare for higher costs and potential disruptions by exploring personal energy solutions today. ## [Avoid Paying Taxes in 2025](https://energynewsbeat.co/investinoil/) [Crude Oil, LNG, Jet Fuel price quote](http://energynewsbeat.co/tradingdesk/) [ENB Top News](http://energynewsbeat.co/top-news/)[ENB](http://energynewsbeat.co/) [Energy Dashboard](https://dashboard.energynewsbeat.com/?_gl=1*ij4iab*_ga*NTEyODgzNzk5LjE3MjM3Mzk2NjU.*_ga_JDVH4V200Q*MTcyNTU2OTQ3MC4xMzMxLjEuMTcyNTU2OTQ5Ny4zMy4wLjA.)

On May 10, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after a series of retaliatory strikes and cross-border clashes triggered by a deadly militant attack on April 22 in India-administered Kashmir, which New Delhi claims was carried out by an alleged Pakistan-backed militant group. Following the ceasefire, India and Pakistan's military leaders held a phone call on May 12 to discuss de-escalation. Later, on May 30, a senior Pakistani military official stated that the two countries were close to reaching an agreement to reduce troop deployments along the border to pre-conflict levels, though no such drawdown has yet been observed....",

Four of the sites were reportedly located in Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, with the remaining five located in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

[Doomberg](https://substack.com/@doomberg) Sep 28, 2025 ∙ Paid 663 [122](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/energy-bind/comments) 22 [Share](javascript:void(0)) _“You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that \\[is\\] it’s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.”_ – Rahm Emanuel One of the great mysteries of our time is why so few media outlets or geopolitical analysts incorporate energy as a core input to their explanations of contemporary events and predictions of the future. While no single parameter is all-encompassing, energy is among the most powerful, and exploring where significant oil and gas resources and infrastructure exist often yields useful insights that defy consensus. Consider Argentina. As early as September 10th, we [postulated](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/mosaic-theory) that the US might be tempted to bail out the country, largely because it is home to one of the largest and most exciting shale oil and gas plays in the world: > “ _The Trump administration may feel compelled to mount a rearguard action in Argentina on behalf of loyal ally President Javier Milei, whose political party was roundly defeated in local elections over the weekend. Although the results do not directly impact his standing at the federal level, the electoral setback is spooking markets just as oil and gas production in the country’s massive Vaca Muerta shale resource is taking off. The country’s bonds and currency both plunged on the news._” Less than two weeks later, [things evolved](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/us/politics/us-argentina-bessent-javier-milei.html) as we anticipated: > “ _The Trump administration pledged on Monday to do whatever is necessary to support Argentina’s struggling economy, throwing a lifeline to the country’s embattled president, Javier Milei, ahead of legislative elections there next month._ > > _Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the United States is prepared to offer loans to Argentina’s central bank, direct currency purchases and purchases of U.S. dollar-denominated Argentine government debt from Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund to keep Argentina’s economy afloat. The value of Argentina’s currency, the peso, has fallen in recent weeks amid concerns about Mr. Milei’s political grip on government._” A deal in progress \\| Getty Over at CNN, the news unsurprisingly was framed through the lens of raw partisan politics. In an analysis titled “ [The Argentina bailout is all about propping up a Trump ally](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/25/business/argentina-bailout-trump-milei),” the words “oil,” “gas,” and “Vaca Muerta” don’t even merit an appearance. Instead, it all comes down to ideology: > “ _The US’s sudden love for Argentina’s economy ‘doesn’t make any sense from a realist, strategic perspective,’ Nate Schenkkan, an independent international relations expert, said in an interview. ‘This kind of stuff only really makes sense within an ideological framework.’_” If one eschews Mr. Schenkkan’s ideological framework and turns instead to brute physics and finance, the potential for significant deals to be struck between Argentina and the Trump administration appears clear. If we are right, the impact on geopolitics and energy will be substantial. Let’s make a few predictions based on the pattern of evidence. ## This post is for paid subscribers [Subscribe](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/subscribe?simple=true&next=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter.doomberg.com%2Fp%2Fenergy-bind%3Futm_source%3D%252Finbox%26utm_medium%3Dreader2&utm_source=paywall&utm_medium=web&utm_content=174682665) [Already a paid subscriber? **Sign in**](https://substack.com/sign-in?redirect=%2Fp%2Fenergy-bind%3Futm_source%3D%252Finbox%26utm_medium%3Dreader2&for_pub=doomberg&change_user=false) PreviousNext",

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor. #### Tails If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called [Tails](https://tails.boum.org). Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.

Please review these basic guidelines. #### 1\\. Contact us if you have specific problems If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please [contact us](https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/10/1042535_-ct-india-country-brief-111118-.html#submit_help_contact). In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations. #### 2\\. What computer to use If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use [Tails](https://tails.boum.org) to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer. #### 3\\. Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.

Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations. #### 2\\. Act normal If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour. #### 3\\. Remove traces of your submission If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used. In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media. If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion. #### 4\\. If you face legal action If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at [https://www.couragefound.org](https://www.couragefound.org). # Submit documents to WikiLeaks WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed.

    "title": "Explainer: How will Trump's tariff affect Indian economy",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "New Delhi: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced the imposition of a 25 percent additional import duty plus penalty on goods imported from India. The duty will come into effect from August 1. The unspecified penalty was imposed on India for purchasing crude oil and military equipment from Russia. The announcement came as a surprise, as the two countries are negotiating a trade agreement. Here is a list of Q&amp;A (questions and answers) to explain the impact of the US move: What is a tariff? These are customs or import duties imposed on the import of goods. The importer has to pay this duty to the government. Normally, companies pass on these taxes to end users. How much tariff is announced on India? The United States has announced that impose a 25 percent tariff plus a penalty for buying Russia’s crude oil and military equipment. However, the US has not specified the quantum of the penalty and how it will be imposed. An executive order from the White House on the 25 percent tariff plus penalty will give clarity on the duty structure. A 10 percent duty (announced on April 2) applies to all goods. Besides, there is a 50 percent tariff on steel and aluminium, and 25 percent on auto and auto parts. These duties are imposed over and above the existing tariffs on Indian goods. For example, textiles attract a 6-9 percent tariff at present, so after adding the 25 percent, Indian textile goods entering the US from August 1 will attract a 31-34 percent duty. A penalty could be added further on this. Why is the US imposing these tariffs? The US has alleged that it faces a significant trade deficit with India, blaming New Delhi for imposing high tariffs on American goods, which it says restricts US exports to the Indian market. What is bilateral trade between India and the US? During 2021-25, the US was India’s largest trading partner in goods. The US accounts for about 18 percent of India’s total exports, 6.22 percent in imports, and 10.73 percent in bilateral trade. In 2024-25, the bilateral trade touched USD 186 billion (USD 86.5 billion exports and USD 45.3 billion imports). With America, India had a trade surplus (the difference between imports and exports) of USD 41 billion in 2024-25. It was USD 35.32 billion in 2023-24 and USD 27.7 billion in 2022-23. In services, India exported an estimated USD 28.7 billion and imported USD 25.5 billion, adding a USD 3.2 billion surplus. Altogether, India ran a total trade surplus of about USD 44.4 billion with the US. However, according to think tank GTRI, the US runs a USD 35-40 billion overall surplus when revenues from education, digital services, financial activities, royalties, and arms trade are factored in. What are the major products traded between the two? In 2024, India’s main exports to the US include: Drug formulations and biologicals (USD 8.1 billion) Telecom instruments (USD 6.5 billion) Precious and semi-precious stones (USD 5.3 billion) Petroleum products (USD 4.1 billion) Vehicle and auto components (USD 2.8 billion) Gold and other precious metal jewellery (USD 3.2 billion) Ready-made garments of cotton, including accessories (USD 2.8 billion) Products of iron and steel (USD 2.7 billion) Imports include: Crude oil (USD 4.5 billion) Petroleum products (USD 3.6 billion) Coal, coke (USD 3.4 billion) Cut and polished diamonds (USD 2.6 billion) Electric machinery (USD 1.4 billion) Aircraft, spacecraft and parts (USD 1.3 billion) Gold (USD 1.3 billion) What will be the impact of the tariffs on this trade? Import duty makes goods expensive in the importing country. Besides, a few other factors also play a role in this. For example, duty on India’s competitor nations such as Bangladesh (35 pc), Vietnam (20 pc) and Thailand (36 pc); and quality and standards of items. According to exporters, Indian labour-intensive goods such as garments, leather and non-leather footwear, gems and jewellery, carpets and handicrafts may get impacted due to this duty. What will be the US tariffs on key Indian goods from August 1? Telecom – 25 pc; gems and jewellery – 30-38.5 pc (5-13.5 pc at present); food and agri goods – 29-30 pc (14-15 pc currently); apparel 12 pc plus 25 pc. Penalty component may also be there from August 1. According to experts, no. The US also imposes high duties on items like dairy products (188 percent), Fruits and vegetables (132 percent), Coffee, tea, cocoa and spices (53 percent), Cereals and food preparations (193 percent), Oilseeds, fats and oils (164 percent), beverages and tobacco (150 percent), Minerals and metals (187 percent), and Chemicals (56 percent). India’s average tariff rate of 17 percent is higher than the US’s 3.3 percent, but similar to other major economies like South Korea (13.4 percent) and China (7.5 percent).

India's Adani Group conglomerate, controlled by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, saw the value of its listed companies plunge dramatically in late January and early February after investment research suggested that Adani's businesses had used a web of shell entities to manipulate stock prices in order to issue more debt. The Adani Group has denied the allegations. This decrease in value forced the company to cancel its $2.4 billion share sale on Jan. 31, and on Feb. 6-7, Adani announced his intention to pre-pay loans, including loans backed by Adani Group shares, to calm investor sentiment and demonstrate that the conglomerate has sufficient liquidity.

    "full_text": "Results from India's general election indicate that the ruling party will return to office but will need to work with coalition partners, which will likely still result in broad domestic economic policy continuity, but will probably also introduce intra-coalition splits on major reforms and controversial social measures that generate some policymaking slowdowns and potential uncertainty. As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

(Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Thus far, only sporadic violent plots and a few low-level attacks have targeted AI infrastructure like data centers. For the most part, pushback has taken the form of rhetoric and some nonviolent protests. The muted response reflects the fact that, for now, AI has yet to significantly demonstrate the type of grand promises or perils forecast by its dreamers or doomsdayers. This will not last. As AI ripples across societies and workplaces, upending daily life, labor markets and politics, the upheaval will inevitably spark backlash -- and at least some of the aggrieved will resort to violence.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

[WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=China%E2%80%99s+Great+Firewall+Now+Orbits+Earth %0A%0A https://stratnewsglobal.com/china/chinas-great-firewall-now-orbits-earth/) China has taken its model of digital control beyond Earth’s atmosphere with the launch of the world’s first prototype “Satellite Internet Firewall,” a development that rights advocates say represents the extension of Beijing’s Great Firewall into orbit. According to Human Rights in China (HRIC), a New York-based nongovernmental organization founded in 1989, the payload was launched on September 5, 2025, aboard a Ceres-1 (Yao-15) carrier rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The project was developed by the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and integrates a mix of artificial intelligence, anomaly detection, on-board inspection, autonomous decision-making, and even “intelligent deception” designed to mislead potential attackers. HRIC described the launch as a milestone in China’s vision of cyber-sovereignty, with far-reaching implications for both national security and global internet governance. “By embedding censorship, surveillance logic, and active defense techniques directly into space infrastructure, China is shaping the rules of the satellite internet race in ways that challenge open-network models such as Starlink,” the group said. In a detailed account, Beiyou News, the university’s news platform, reported that the firewall payload was one of three satellites launched on September 5. The “Satellite Internet Firewall” was independently developed by the National Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications at BUPT, under the leadership of Professors Zhao Yongli and Zhang Jie, and guided by Academician Guo Shize. Beiyou News said the project marked “a historic step forward” for China in satellite internet security, describing it as the world’s first multi-dimensional integrated security payload capable of protecting both the physical and network layers of satellite internet systems. The payload integrates several advanced technologies: - Multi-dimensional rule engine for filtering and detection. - AI-powered abnormal behavior sensing to detect suspicious activity. - Onboard inspections conducted in real time. - Large-scale autonomous decision-making models capable of running 14-billion-parameter optimization tasks. - Intelligent trapping mechanisms designed to lure and study attackers. This combination allows the satellite to detect and block cyberattacks in real time, safeguarding critical business and government communications. The system reportedly has the capacity to manage traffic at 10 Gbps concurrency, with more than 70,000 threat detection rules embedded. The firewall is designed to act as the first line of defense for satellite-to-ground and intersatellite communications. By providing onboard computing power and a real-time defense orchestration environment, the payload creates what Beiyou News called “an in-orbit firewall” that protects against high-volume and sudden traffic surges. The system also conducts automatic health checks of satellite ports and key services every minute, ensuring constant monitoring and protection. By linking network-layer threat detection with physical-layer monitoring, the firewall establishes a closed-loop defense mechanism. Beiyou News emphasized that the payload represented “a comprehensive improvement” of China’s satellite internet security capabilities, blending artificial intelligence and cybersecurity technologies into a lightweight but powerful defense system. HRIC warned that the satellite firewall extends the reach of China’s censorship and surveillance regime. Unlike traditional ground-based systems, which operate within national borders, the deployment of firewalls in orbit could impact global information flows, especially if China offers “secure” satellite internet to partner states under its Belt and Road Initiative or other strategic frameworks. “Who gets to decide what information flows freely in orbit?” HRIC asked in its analysis. The group argued that embedding such technology into the very infrastructure of space networks could consolidate Beijing’s control over not only its own population but also foreign users who depend on Chinese satellite services. The rights organization also highlighted the potential conflict between China’s satellite firewall and open-network systems like SpaceX’s Starlink, which are premised on unrestricted access to the internet. The deployment of censorship logic in orbit, HRIC said, could reshape competition in the satellite internet sector by making “secure but restricted” services an exportable model. For Beijing, the launch signals both a scientific breakthrough and a political statement. The successful development of the prototype firewall demonstrates China’s ability to integrate artificial intelligence into space-based cybersecurity systems despite limited onboard resources. It also reflects the government’s long-standing goal of fusing technological advancement with national security priorities. Beiyou News noted that the project was achieved after “repeated program demonstrations, technical breakthroughs, and payload optimization.” The team overcame challenges such as limited computing power in space and the need for real-time intelligent decision-making. The news outlet described the achievement as supporting China’s mission of “serving national needs, targeting international frontiers, focusing on scientific and technological innovation, and supporting major scientific and technological projects and national security needs.” HRIC underscored the symbolic dimension of the launch: the export of the “Great Firewall” from terrestrial networks to orbital systems. What began in the 1990s as a domestic mechanism for controlling access to foreign websites has now, with the September 5 launch, reached beyond Earth’s atmosphere. By moving censorship into orbit, China is positioning itself not just as a global power in space technology but as a rule-setter in the future governance of the satellite internet. As HRIC noted, “This is a milestone in China’s vision of extending cyber-sovereignty into orbit.” ##### [Ramananda Sengupta](https://stratnewsglobal.com/author/ramananda-sengupta/) [\\+ postsBio ⮌](https://stratnewsglobal.com/stratnewsglobal.com) In a career spanning three decades and counting, Ramananda (Ram to his friends) has been the foreign editor of The Telegraph, Outlook Magazine and the New Indian Express.

On April 2, the United States announced a new set of tariffs impacting many trading partners, including a 37% tariff on Bangladesh, 30% on Pakistan and 44% on Sri Lanka. While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances.

On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up...",

Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance Washington could start imposing tariffs against a wider...
