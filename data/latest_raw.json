These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. India’s long-running class-based, economic insurgency—the Naxalite insurgency (or Community Party of India [CPI]-Maoist insurgency)—is a case study in which external secu\u0002rity partnerships will remain limited, if not mostly unwelcomed, in New Delhi. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of do\u0002mestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Washington would be ill-served by an In\u0002dian backlash to such unwelcomed assertiveness. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime secu\u0002rity activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counter\u0002terrorism intelligence-sharing and operations. The United States instead should focus on not only its offers of major near-term bilateral military assistance for security cooperation but also, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns in New Delhi and Washington. 2 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Introduction This paper frames the contours of the recent and ongoing expansion in U.S.-India security ties. Then it briefly sketches the trajectory of the Naxalite insurgency through its first two phases and then focuses on the factors that made its third phase—from 2004 to the present—such a serious security challenge. The paper highlights the unique domestic factors that allowed the Naxalite rebellion’s rise to the status of India’s most significant internal security challenge from 2007 to 2010. It also identifies those domestic factors that enabled effective counterinsurgency actions beginning in 2011 and effective containment of the threat by 2014. After indicating the kinds of bilateral security assistance offered by the United States to India in recent years, the paper indicates the limited appeal of outside assistance to India in the domestic counterinsur\u0002gency arena and assesses why India’s self-selected counterinsurgency partnership limitations remain firmly in place. It concludes with some lessons learned for U.S. policymakers in terms of the opportunities and limitations for working with India in matters of domestic insurgency, advising that these limitations make sense on many levels. It also asserts that India’s limitations should be respected in Washington and Honolulu to avoid backlash from New Delhi. Any such backlash might threaten far more important U.S.-India bilateral interests in which shared mari\u0002time and other strategic interests seem to increasingly diverge with those of China and in areas of mutual benefit from global counterterrorism cooperation. The analysis in this paper is based on 3 years of author research into the unique features of the Naxalite insurgency in India. The research includes field interviews conducted on three visits to India during 2014 and 2015, one of which featured time in Kolkata and West Bengal. Expanding U.S.-India Security Framework, with Limits Growing for more than a decade, bilateral defense and security cooperation between the United States and India began accelerating quickly in 2014 and continued into 2016. Much of this acceleration, although not all of it, owed to the tone and tenor of the Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, elected and seated in 2014. Modi’s government, which is Indian nationalist with a dynamic economic, diplomatic, and security agenda, followed a decade-long Indian National Congress (INC) government that had become sclerotic in its dealings with the United States and other global partners from 2009 to 2013. The INC government set the table for U.S.-India defense and security cooperation during the mid-2000s, demonstrating a broad\u0002based Indian commitment to improved bilateral relations with the United States after decades 3 India’s Naxalite Insurgency of limited transactions. But the nationalist government of Prime Minister Modi has been driv\u0002ing it forward vigorously. The ongoing acceleration in broad Indo-American relations has taken many forms, in\u0002cluding high diplomacy. Prime Minister Modi made visiting the United States a priority, travel\u0002ing to America within 4 months of his May 2014 accession to the position of prime minister. Modi then made President Barack Obama the first ever U.S. President bestowed the high honor as chief guest at India’s Republic Day Parade in January 2015. During this visit, Obama and Modi signed a historic Joint U.S.-India Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region.1 Modi made a third informal visit to the United States in September 2015, using this historically rapid return to enhance economic relations between the national private and public sectors.2 The United States has committed to a wide array of economic projects in India fea\u0002turing public-private innovation, deeper financial cooperation and inclusive digital networks, “smart city” development in selected Indian cities, and support for increasing economic con\u0002nectivity between India and the states of South and Southeast Asia.3 The acceleration of broad bilateral ties has been showcased by the steady increase in de\u0002fense and security cooperation between the two countries. In June 2016, on a historic fourth visit to the United States and in conjunction with a third bilateral summit,4 Prime Minister Modi made a joint statement with President Obama declaring India and the United States to be “major defense partners,” expressing aspirations for expanded exchange of dual-use technolo\u0002gies and maritime security cooperation.5 The outcomes from this mid-2016 leadership engage\u0002ment underscored the fact that there have been noteworthy enhancements in military technol\u0002ogy interaction processes, basic military logistics and administrative arrangements, and joint military exercises. Since 2014, Prime Minister Modi has accelerated the process of bilateral security collabo\u0002ration on military modernization with emphasis on greater foreign investment in the Indian defense sector than ever before. Modi’s government covets American participation in India’s defense industry build-out to a degree not seen in the previous Indian government. The United States has worked to expand its 2012 bilateral defense initiative with India known as the U.S.- India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI). Pursuant to President Obama’s January 2015 visit for Republic Day, the United States has focused DTTI in pursuit of six major defense technology co-development and co-production efforts. There has been a particular focus on deeper cooperation in the areas of maritime security and maritime domain awareness.6 The United States and India also have done serious work on establishing basic frame\u0002work defense agreements that would enable closer cooperation and collaboration between their 4 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 militaries. Throughout 2015 and early 2016, both governments worked hard to develop mutu\u0002ally acceptable text for three critical military-to-military agreements. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), Basic Exchange and Coopera\u0002tion Agreement (BECA), and—perhaps the most consequential of the three—Logistics Supply Agreement.7 Aimed to move beyond the limited U.S.-India 2002 General Security of Military Information Agreement that underpinned modest U.S.-India defense interactions for more than a decade, the bilateral effort on these documents demonstrated important forward prog\u0002ress. Yet this progress did not beget culmination in formal agreements. Many observers hoped that these arrangements would be ready for signature during Secretary of Defense Ash Carter’s April 2016 visit to New Delhi for discussions with Minister of Defense Manohar Parrikar. But Indian sensitivities and complications in language and trust limited the April joint announce\u0002ment to one confirming that the defense leaders were agreed in principal—but had not yet signed—a modified Logistics Supply Agreement, known as a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement.8 It also signaled that both parties must continue to work on “other” agreements to enhance military cooperation and technology transfer. The CISMOA and BECA were not formally mentioned in the final statement of the meeting.9 In the area of joint military exercises, the U.S.-India partnership has been expanding. In 2015, India conducted more joint military exercises with the U.S. military than any other in the world.10 India and United States agreed in 2015 to extend a permanent invitation for Japanese naval forces to participate annually in Exercise Malabar. The United States, India, and Japan held Malabar 2016 in early June in the northern waters of the Philippine Sea, an area close to the East and South China seas, signaling to Beijing that the three nations hold a common interest in freedom of high seas navigation in all areas of the Pacific Ocean.11 But the acceleration and expansion of bilateral security interactions come with Indian limitations—ones that must temper U.S. policymaker aims, ambitions, and expectations. While agreeing to participate in the 2016 Malabar exercise with Japan and the United States in the northern Philippines, India firmly declined an offer by the commander of U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, to sign on for joint naval patrols with the United States, Japan, and Aus\u0002tralia in the South Pacific.12 India also has remained wary of any firm commitment to a bilateral defense CISMOA or BECA. Despite more than 2 years of bilateral effort, there remains no real progress on the joint development of jet engines or aircraft carrier technologies—both of which are target technologies for joint development.13 Each of these factors and more demonstrate that crafting a bilateral defense partnership between the United States and India will be a slow process 5 India’s Naxalite Insurgency that requires better understanding of differing critical equities. This process requires sustained, patient leadership in both countries in the face of certain frustrations moving forward. Scoping Bilateral Security Collaboration Limits: Indian Domestic Counterinsurgency and Counterterrorism The U.S. and Indian militaries have their own detailed and unique experiences in counter\u0002insurgency operations, so counterinsurgency seems a logical focal point for greater U.S.-India defense collaboration and partnership, and in many ways it is. But in other ways, it is not. U.S. policymakers and security analysts should understand the differences. When it comes to outside assistance and security partnership collaboration with India in its ongoing experiences with domestic insurgency, U.S. policymakers and military leaders must remain aware that India does not—and likely will not—treat U.S. military offers of direct assis\u0002tance with a warm welcome. India’s experiences with its long-running domestic Naxalite insur\u0002gency provide a powerful example about the limited scope for U.S. military engagement and the circumspect manner in which any U.S. security assistance must be approached with New Delhi. The lessons about context, tenor, and tone found in the example of the Naxalite insurgency over the past 10 years demonstrate that the United States is a better partner for India when remaining at distance, as New Delhi deals with its unique domestic insurgency challenges. India’s Approach to Domestic Insurgency Over the past 60 years, India has confronted three major domestic insurgencies.14 In Jam\u0002mu and Kashmir, disaffected Muslim groups and unsatisfied local populations have contested India’s so-called occupation of its territories on the southeastern side of the Line of Control. India’s northeast has undergone multiple, overlapping waves of tribal, socioethnic-based insur\u0002gent movements since the mid-1950s. These northeastern separatist insurgencies have ebbed and flowed as Indian military and political approaches to their grievances eliminated some and catalyzed others. India also has been confronted with economic class–based violence and armed confrontation in its eastern regions, violence referred to as a Naxalite or Maoist insurgency. Numerous Indian analysts, and some outsiders, argue that India has among the best re\u0002cords in the world when combating insurgencies.15 The claim is debatable on many levels. Yet it does accurately reflect that India has persistent experience with a variety of domestic insurgencies over a considerable period of time. Official Indian counterinsurgency doctrine formally espouses a population-centric strategy focused on winning “hearts and minds.”16 A more detailed examination of India’s record reveals that India often does take a political 6 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 approach in combination with a military one when facing domestic insurgencies. However, India’s political approaches often are less about hearts and minds and more often feature ex\u0002tended periods of national-level tolerance of state- and local-level politician and police leader\u0002ship manipulation of insurgent groups. Often this manipulation is in the pursuit of regional and local vote banks (or vote blocks). Frequently manipulation is followed by the co-option of rebellion elites in an effort to buy-out, or limit the insurgency once it festers to a level beyond the ability of the state and regional authorities to manage. Co-option approaches have taken the forms of turning insurgents through monetary compensation, creating new political space for a “turned” insurgent group, or abducting and torturing key insurgent leaders.17 Quite often these nonkinetic approaches have created their own problems with corrupt security forces, increased criminal activity, and a litany of human rights complaints and investigations.18 India’s employment of military forces in domestic counterinsurgency operations has fea\u0002tured a number of innovative practices, some successful and others counterproductive. When engaged fully, the Indian national response tends to feature a combination of state police forces, Central Armed Police Forces, special paramilitary units, and—in some cases such as Kashmir and India’s Northeast—the introduction of regular army units. India’s federal statutes mandate that the chief minister (or governor) of a state formally request national police (including Cen\u0002tral Armed Police Forces units), paramilitary, or national army support before such forces can be introduced into a counterinsurgency fight. In those cases when the army is introduced, it must be authorized by the prime minister and given authorities by the Indian parliament to operate under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which includes the authority for military forces to make arrests, search without warrants, and shoot to kill civilians when required.19 In\u0002dia’s martial counterinsurgency activities are normally “enemy centric” and have been assessed to regularly feature a strategy of attrition and raw coercion where overwhelming numbers of security forces attempt to suffocate the insurgency at the same time that political activities are conducted to co-opt its leadership.20 There are several important conclusions to be drawn about India’s historical approach to domestic counterinsurgency. First, India does pursue varied counterinsurgency approaches to its multiple domestic insurgencies, depending on the unique context of each. Some respons\u0002es—such as those in Jammu and Kashmir and Northeast India—have featured a permanent deployment of the Indian army. Other responses, such as those toward the respective phases of the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India, have been limited to national central armed police forces (mainly but not exclusively Central Reserve Police Forces [CRPF]) deployment into the unsettled states from the central government (see appendix B for detail on national special 7 India’s Naxalite Insurgency police units). Second, India’s political and military approaches toward domestic insurgency generally do not follow a classic hearts and minds approach. Instead, they normally feature enemy-centric and highly kinetic military operations combined with creative, and often con\u0002troversial, political co-option of selected insurgent groups and group leaders. Third, India’s federal democratic structure often drives domestic counterinsurgency responses that feature uncomfortable political tradeoffs at the local level, state level, and between the state and the national governments. The political mobilization aspect of domestic insurgent groups creates incentives for political parties to harness these groups for their own ends.21 Invariably, this political utility makes them hard to counter in a timely manner and then difficult to address in the face of growing corruption, illegal activities, and often human rights questions as they embed into the political and social space. In general, Indian domestic counterinsurgency has worked for the country out and its distinctive system of governance and its complex national ethnic makeup. India’s approaches have contained, but not eliminated, the three major insurgencies that it has faced since inde\u0002pendence. But for many Westerners, India’s domestic counterinsurgency “successes” can look exceptionally violent and uncomfortably incomplete.22 This divergence in perspectives is im\u0002portant. It indicates why India prefers strict autonomy in the conduct of its domestic counterin\u0002surgent operations, routinely brushing aside the limited offers of direct outside military support that it receives. It also demonstrates why outside partners, including the United States, should realize that if they push too aggressively in offering well-intentioned direct assistance in these areas, they could encounter significant resistance in New Delhi—possible to the point where security cooperation could be dampened in other more important areas of mutual interest. India’s deep past and recent experiences with the Naxalite insurgency demonstrate the wisdom of these conclusions. The Naxalite Insurgency—History and Context: Phases 1 and 2 The Naxalite insurgency started as a communist peasant revolt in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It later evolved into a combination of ethnic-, caste-, and class-based political violence across a number of the poorest provinces in India’s east.23 It became known as Naxalism, or the Naxalite movement, given its late 1950s origins as a Maoist movement struggling for in\u0002dependence in the small village of Naxalbari in the state of West Bengal, along the Indo-Nepal border (see map 1).24 The 1967 Naxalbari uprising against feudal landlords sowed the seeds for insurgency in India.25 8 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 The Naxalites were a group of far-left radical communists who promoted Maoist political sentiment and ideology to fight exploitation by landlords in India’s feudal postcolonial socio\u0002economic system. In this approach, the Naxalites broke from the tradition of Indian communist Map 1. States and Union Territories of India 9 India’s Naxalite Insurgency political participation in the electoral system supplemented by general worker strikes that had been the staple of Communist Party of India activity from the 1920s through the 1950s.26 Dur\u0002ing the 1940s and 1950s, the CPI had become aligned with Moscow in its international leanings, functioning in India mainly as a political party. Around the same time, communism in India split in a third direction, with the CPI-Marxist group taking a more radical approach to its po\u0002litical rhetoric but mainly pursuing its own independent parliamentary path.27 Naxalism is based upon an extremist belief that the Indian government is a semicolonial, feudalistic, and imperial entity that needs to be overthrown. Naxalism’s objective is to seize state power through a protracted armed struggle against big landlords and petty government of\u0002ficials. Naxalism takes up the cause of the marginalized sections of society. It often opposes the implementation of various developmental projects such as construction of roads, rails, schools, and hospitals in affected areas in order to demonstrate to the people the ineffectiveness of the state. When successful, the Naxalite movement has operated in a vacuum created by the absence or collapse of the administrative structure at the local, provincial, or state level.28 The Naxalite movement has evolved through three separate phases in India. The first phase ran from the late 1960s through 1973. The second phase occurred from the late 1970s through 1994. The third and most significant phase formally began in 2004, reaching a peak of violence from 2005 to 2011 and declining to a nadir in 2014. A short review of the first two phases of the Naxalite insurgency establishes its patterns and India’s preferred security framework for dealing with this domestic stability threat. A more detailed review of the third and most noteworthy phase of the Naxalite insurgency follows in a subsequent section. First Phase, 1967–1973 Inspired by Maoist revolutionary tactics and the Cultural Revolution in China, the Naxalite movement gained momentum and began in the late 1960s and 1970s. Initially the movement centered in the Indian states of West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh (map 1). It featured peasants seizing land by force and then taking up arms to protect themselves against police and landlord response.29 Soon these rural activities merged with politically disillusioned and ideologically driven university students from Kolkata and other urban areas in India’s Far East—with active cells stretching from the state of Bihar in the north to Adhra Pradesh in the south. By 1969 un\u0002der charismatic leader Charu Mazumdar, the Naxalites organized as the CPI–Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) and attempted more centralized and violent tactics.30 CPI-ML moved to organize peasants and seize political power through guerilla warfare while focusing on annihilation of its class enemies.31 In urban areas such as Kolkata (then known as Calcutta), Naxalite insurgents 10 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 targeted police and local constables, attacking police outposts and patrols with an aim to cap\u0002ture weapons.32 Despite some limited weapons assistance and rhetorical support from Mao’s Communist government in the 1960s, China never undertook a strong campaign of support for the Nax\u0002alites.33 The Naxalites remained fragmented and without much training or organization. This first wave of Naxalite violence peaked in 1971 when over 3,650 acts of class-based attacks were reported and more than 850 people were reported killed. But it quickly succumbed to its own weaknesses and a state counterinsurgency response that featured two waves of activity. From the summer of 1969 through the end of 1971, state-led counterinsurgency campaigns against the rural Naxalite cadres decimated much of those insurgency cadres. State police, as\u0002sisted by the CRPF, moved against poorly armed Naxalites with great effect. By 1971 these po\u0002lice forces were joined by army units deployed into West Bengal. It took the failure of local and state police to contain Naxalite insurgents for more than 2 years before the West Bengal deputy chief minister—himself a politician from the CPI-Maoist party—requested assistance from a central paramilitary force, the Eastern Frontier Rifles, to assist state security forces. Then in July and August of 1971 a more dangerous component of the Naxalite insurgency in West Ben\u0002gal’s Birbhum District was put down by a joint campaign led by the army known as Operation Steeplechase. Army involvement only came after the collapse of an Indian National Congress– led coalition government in West Bengal and the New Delhi declaration of “President’s Rule” throughout the region. This made the central government responsible for the fight against the Naxalites and enabled Prime Minister Indira Ghandi to divert elements of the army massing along the East Pakistan border for what would become the December 1971 Indo-Pakistani War that assisted local police in decisive counterinsurgency operations.34 The urban dimension of the first wave of the Naxalite insurgency remained violent throughout 1971 and festered into the next 2 years, even as the rural component succumbed to Operation Steeplechase. Interparty political violence in Kolkata among the INC, CPI-M, and CPI-ML led to a swirl of assassinations and attacks against security forces and political leaders across urban areas. The election of a new West Bengal chief minister from the INC in March 1972 turned the tide on the urban Naxals. The law and order platform of Chief Minister Sid\u0002dharth Shankar Ray played out in a much more muscular police role across Kolkata and its surroundings throughout mid-1972 and into mid-1973. Kolkata police apprehended Naxalite leader Charu Maumdar in July 1972, and he died in custody several weeks later. Naxalite lead\u0002ers across the city succumbed to increasing police and state paramilitary presence. By 1973 the main cadres of the Naxalites had been eliminated and were dead or behind bars.35 11 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In this first Naxalite insurgent phase, the national government followed a pattern that would be repeated in subsequent phases. It did not forcibly intervene in the beginning. In keep\u0002ing with the federalist framework of the constitution, the government in New Delhi left it to local and state officials in West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and other afflicted states to take their own security actions to stop the threat. In the late 1960s, these state and local responses were often inadequate and ineffective.36 The central government only engaged with security forces once it had a critical mass of army forces in the region for the 1971–1972 war with Pakistan over Bangladesh and when the President’s Rule special authorities were in place, which enabled the military the power to make preventative arrests, search premises without a warrant, and shoot to kill civilians. Once engaged, the slowly evolving national response became one featuring intense force and coercion, eradicating the violence without eliminating the insurgency’s socio\u0002economic preconditions. Second Phase, 1977–1994 India’s first wave of insurgent violence ended badly for this domestic left-wing extremist movement but did not eliminate the conditions inspiring the movement or all of those willing to hold to the Naxalite cause. The movement fractured into more than 40 separate small groups.37 Slowly—over the course of a decade—these groups began to remobilize and consolidate. Par\u0002ticularly in the southeastern Indian state of Adhra Pradesh, a new Naxalite organization called People’s War emerged. Its leader, Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, sought a more efficient structure to boost morale, recruitment, and funding. By 1978 Naxalite peasant revolts had spread to the Karimnagar District of Telangana and Adilabad District of Adhra Pradesh. The major grievance was unpaid wages. Second-wave Naxalite insurgents kidnapped landlords and forced them to confess to crimes, apologize to villagers, and repay forced bribes. By the early 1980s insurgents had established a stronghold and sanctuary in the interlinked North Telangana village and Dan\u0002dakaranya forests areas along the Adhra Pradesh and Orissa border.38 In 1985 Naxalite insurgents began ambushing police. After they killed a police sub-inspec\u0002tor in Warangal, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh responded by creating a special task force called the Greyhounds to establish control in the seven worst affected districts. An elite anti-Naxalite commando unit that still exists today, the Greyhounds were drawn from within the Andhra Pradesh police forces and given special treatment. A 2,000-strong force in 2015, the Grey\u0002hounds were given preferred payment and training—better than federal or state paramilitary forces. They were also highly supported by the entire state police force. The Greyhounds played a minimal role in combatting the Naxalites during the second phase of the Maoist insurgency.39 12 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In 1987 the Naxalite political party (People’s War) and other Maoist groups in Andhra Pradesh were barred from elections after kidnapped government officials were exchanged for Naxalite prisoners. The ban was briefly lifted in 1991. In December of that year, however, insur\u0002gent attacks increased. Affected states responded by establishing special laws that enabled police to focus on capture, detention, and extra-normal means of violence against Naxalite cadres— fighters and presumed supporters.40 Adhra Pradesh and Orissa invited additional central para\u0002military forces in Telangana to augment state and federal government security forces already there. Besides brute force, the state set up rival mass organizations to attract youth away from the Naxalites, started rehabilitation programs, and established new informant networks.41 The new counterinsurgency strategy reduced violent incidents, and nearly 9,000 Naxalites surrendered. Consequently in 1994 the ban on ostensibly moderate Naxalite political parties was lifted.42 The second wave of the Naxalite insurgency had been stopped. However, and as at the end of the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency, the socioeconomic conditions underpin\u0002ning Naxalism remained largely unchanged in many regions of eastern India. Third Phase, 2004–2015 From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s the Naxalite insurgency remained largely out of the public eye, but the movement had not gone away. Taking advantage of rising local support for violent response to economic conditions, fragmented Naxalite groups created a united front: the People’s War, Party Unity, and the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) combined to form the People’s War Group (PWG). Naxalism manifested itself in episodic spurts of violence by the PWG, which had its most pronounced presence in Adhra Pradesh. From 1999–2002, local level violence increased. The PWG accelerated attacks on state government locations in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Chhattisgarh. By 2000 an estimated 3,000 armed Naxalite rebels were re\u0002portedly active in India’s east.43 During this time, Indian government agencies took actions that accelerated grievances among the poor and displaced with sympathies for left-wing violence. First, economic growth and development led to local and state government appropriation of land for infrastructure and resource development, displacing many underprivileged people who had no political voice. Second, governments responded to Naxalite violence with acute violence, reportedly includ\u0002ing the extra-judicial murder and torture of suspected rebels and rebel families.44 The MCC intensified its campaign of violence against Indian security forces and government agencies in 2002–2003 after its leader was killed by police.45 13 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In 2004, the PWG was superseded by the CPI-M.46 From this 2004 merger of the two larg\u0002est Naxalite factions—the PWG and MCC—into the CPI-M, Maoist ideology was fused with a cadre of armed groups for the first time.47 A third and more lethal wave of violence—more sophisticated and more destructive—rapidly spread throughout eastern India. Naxalite leaders expanded control over natural resource rich areas (for example, coal, gas, precious minerals, and timber). They also collected taxes and extortion money to fund weapons production, including the production of crude but effective improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Estimates from 2004 to 2011 suggest the Naxalites extracted at least $18.4 million annually from government offices, contractors, businessmen, and industrialists.They embarked upon more choreographed terror campaigns including the murder of local politicians, overwhelming attacks on local police sta\u0002tions, impressment of child soldiers, and a general campaign to scare away outside investors. By the second half of 2005, Naxalites demonstrated a lethality and reach far beyond the capacity of other domestic terrorist and insurgent groups. They destroyed buildings, captured weapons, and killed several local policemen in an attack on a village in Uttar Pradesh. They also attacked the Jehanabad Prison in Bihar, killing two, freeing more than 300 inmates, and abduct\u0002ing about 30 inmates who were members of an anti-Naxalite group. Total deaths from Naxalite\u0002attributed insurgency and terrorism grew to more than 800 in the impacted east and north\u0002eastern regions.48 In 2006 and 2007, this trend expanded. In 2006, Naxalite groups launched several high-profile attacks against civilians and security forces, expanding the rural territory under Maoist control and under threat of extreme violence. In one event, an attack by some 800 armed Naxalites in Chhattisgarh killed 25, injured 80 more, and saw some 250 people declared missing.49 In 2006, the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh grew concerned about the mounting threat posed by Naxalite groups to internal stability and democratic traditions across the east and southeast of India. The Naxalite menace had grown such that 18 of India’s federal states and 194 of its total districts were effected by Naxalite violence. For the first time Prime Minister Singh called the Naxalite/Maoist insurgency and associated terrorism “the sin\u0002gle biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”50 In 2007 Naxalite and Maoist violence reached an apex where it would remain for the next 4 years through 2010 (see map 2). Over 971 Naxalite attacks were recorded in the first seven months of 2007. That number would grow to over 1,500 attacks by the end of the year (see table51). Left-wing extremists began target\u0002ing elected officials including a member of the Indian parliament from Jharkhand state and the son of a former chief minister (or governor) of Andhra Pradesh.52 By 2010 the Naxalites were active in nine Indian states and reported to have a strong foot\u0002hold in parts of seven: West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, 14 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 and Maharashtra. This region happened to sit atop tremendous iron ore, coal, and aluminum deposits as well as irrigation and hydroelectric power potential. Across these states there were more than 2,200 incidents of Naxalite violence and almost 1,200 killed in 2010 alone (table).53 Map 2. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2007 15 India’s Naxalite Insurgency The threat to Indian national interests became obvious to the federal government and more co\u0002ordinated actions followed. From 2005 through 2010, Naxalite violence and the insufficient state-led, federally sup\u0002ported efforts to counter it cost India an average of more than 700 deaths per year. Most of these individuals were classified as civilian (see appendix A). Recruited from the disaffected rural poor, Naxalite cadres grew by 2010 to an estimated 20,000 armed fighters and an additional 50,000 supporters.54 In 2010, as he had first done in 2006, Prime Minister Singh trumpeted the risks of Naxalite violence to the stability and the ever important economic growth for the country. In May of that year, Prime Minister Singh referred to Naxalism as the “biggest internal security challenge” India has ever faced.55 The national government was understandably frustrated. From January to June 2009, India witnessed over 1,100 Naxalite-generated incidents of violence. These would double by the end of 2009 (table). Major violence occurred during national elections held from April to May 2009 as Naxalites called for an election boycott, attacked polling places, set off land mines, and even took control of a region of West Bengal known as Lalgarh. Paramilitary and police response operations against Naxalite locations were largely unsuccessful.56 Naxalite atrocities gained national notoriety. But simultaneously, accusations of systematic local police brutality and local and federal police human rights abuses against innocent civilians grew more vocal throughout the affected zones.57 In 2010 Naxalite violence inflicted 9 separate states of India and over 200 individual districts.58 Year 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 All Incidents 1,088 1,091 1,136 1,415 1,760 2,212 2,258 1,591 1,565 1,509 1,608 1,533 Attacks on Police 118 155 143 135 131 230 250 192 N/A 210 194 N/A Total Deaths 251 280 376 321 532 1,138 907 648 650 685 846 636 N/A = specific data not available Sources: “Left Wing Extremist (LWE) Data,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of Naxal Violence During 2008 to 2012,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of LWE Violence During 2011 to 2016 (up to 31.03.2016),” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; Government of India Ministry of Home Affairs, “Annual Reports,” available at. Table. Major Incidents During Naxalite Insurgency, Third Phase 16 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In March 2010, after months of prevarication and confusion, the national government launched Operation Green Hunt. The initiative added an additional estimated 20,000 federal paramilitary troops, mainly from the CRPF battalions, to existing state, local, and already pres\u0002ent Ministry of Home Affairs forces from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Border Security Forc\u0002es, and Shashastra Seema Bal.59 (See appendix B for detail on MHA special police units.) The operation sent federal, state, and local police and paramilitary forces into former no-go zones deep in the forests of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra states to rid them of militants, but these operations struggled. In April 2010, Naxalite insurgents ambushed 80 troops of the Indian Cen\u0002tral Police Security Forces (CPSF) in Chhattisgarh, killing an estimated 75 in the worst attack on Indian security forces since the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency began.60 In February 2011 Naxalites kidnapped two Indian government officials, demanding a halt to Green Hunt. The government agreed. The Naxalites also demanded the release of seven top imprisoned lead\u0002ers in exchange for the two officials. After a May 2011 Naxalite attack, 10 bodies of policemen were found dismembered in dense forest.61 Despite the major setbacks of 2010–2011, Indian federal and state authorities made some headway against a Naxalite insurgency now generating international headlines.62 Better coordi\u0002nated joint federal-state anti-Naxalite security operations killed a prominent Naxalite military leader, Koteswara Rao, in a November 2011 operation. In 2012 government paramilitary and police operations in West Bengal and Chhattisgarh began to produce results, with more than 1,800 Naxalite insurgents reported arrested and another 440 surrendered during the year.63 In late 2012 several Naxalite regional military leaders were captured and killed in those provinces. Acts of extreme violence continued during 2012 and 2013, but the expanse of the insur\u0002gency began to abate. Insurgency-related fatalities declined in 2012 and remained below 400 in 2013 (table). West Bengal reported sharp declines in Naxalite presence and activities dur\u0002ing 2013, although some observers declared that the decline in those states was offset by a corresponding increase of Naxalite violence in neighboring states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Orissa (appendix A). The Naxalites began the practice of including booby-trapping the bodies of dead Indian soldiers with IEDs in their stomachs. They killed national Congressman, and an\u0002ti-Naxalite militia Salwa Judum founder, Mahendra Karma in an attack on his convoy while he was campaigning for election in rural Chhattisgarh communities. Prime Minister Singh called for a two-pronged approach to dismantle the Naxalite network: sustaining joint and proactive military operations with greater economic development and responsible governance programs in the areas with strongest Maoist support. The CRPF successfully launched a 5-day interstate offensive in late December 2013 to dismantle core Maoist groups.64 It shut down a gun manu- 17 India’s Naxalite Insurgency facturing factory and recovered numerous weapons and explosives. Remote triggering devices were also found, indicating that the insurgency was using more advanced weaponry. By 2014 fatalities from Naxalite violence dropped below 300 for the first time in more than a decade (table). Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh remained most affected by the violence, and some Naxalite groups conducted operations and expanded into southern regions of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka states. But a review of the map in 2013 of Naxalite-impacted areas revealed a significant drop in the overall number of affected districts since 2007—from 165 to 120 overall—and an even more significant drop in districts categorized as experiencing severe or moderate amounts of violence from Naxalite activities over the same period—from 69 dis\u0002tricts in 2007 to just 28 in 2013 (see map 3). Eighty percent of Naxalite violence now afflicted only three states of India, down from the nine states impacted by serious Naxalite violence in 2010. On balance the tide had turned. By the end of 2014 the Naxalite insurgency was down if not out.65 In 2015, Indian joint security and economic efforts to counter the remaining Naxalite threat focused on 30 key districts in these 3 most impacted states, enabling more concentrated efforts matching gradually applied paramilitary enforcement with legal reforms and develop\u0002ment activities.66 As in the first two waves of Naxalite insurgency, the Indian federal-state government dis\u0002connect hampered its counterinsurgency efforts throughout the 2000s. Under the Indian con\u0002stitution, states bear the responsibility for enforcing law and order. When required, however, the federal government can send police and—under more limited conditions—military troops. In the case of federal police, assistance can come only upon request from the state government. In the case of military troops, assistance can come in the event of a state of emergency declara\u0002tion—as during the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency. Throughout the period from 2000 to 2010, the federal and state home (interior) ministries supervised multiple police and intelligence agencies without much unity of effort or command. An operation against Naxalite groups in the state of Bihar early in the 2000s faltered. Federal paramilitary border security forces in seven districts helped the local police, and millions of ru\u0002pees were promised in economic development opportunities. But the economic promises were broken, and poorly coordinated security operations only further alienated Naxalite moderates, derailing hoped for results by early 2002. In advance of 2004 elections in Chhattisgarh, the fed\u0002eral government sent 180 companies of paramilitary forces armed with helicopters and other advanced equipment. The Naxalites disappeared. Once the elections were over, federal troops and equipment departed and the Naxalites returned. 18 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 From the 2004 merger of Naxalite groups, the Indian government, particularly at the federal level, applied both carrots and sticks, incentivizing insurgents to pick constitutional remedies and brutally punishing those who refused. But the splits between state and federal authorities limited effectiveness. In part, state and local governments saw themselves in a co\u0002nundrum; they wanted an end to the organized Naxalite violence targeting them, their infra\u0002Map 3. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2013 19 India’s Naxalite Insurgency structure, and their legal enforcement structure. However, they did not want to alienate the vote banks across their states who sympathized with the Naxalite view of economic injustice but did not actively participate in violence. In one notable but far from unique instance, the chief minister (or governor) of the Naxalite-wracked state of Jharkhand won election in 2009 with strong insurgent sympathizer and insurgent vote bank support.67 State-level leaders de\u0002sired greater economic support from the central government, not overwhelming force, as the primary means to redress deeply held communist sympathies in their vote constituencies. Na\u0002tional political leaders within the INC empathized with these state-level concerns, offering some economic support and some additional policing support—but too little of either to make significant headway prior to 2010–2011. The politics of left-wing issues and voter concerns made effective coordination of counterinsurgency versus the Naxalites difficult. It took the extensive violence and loss of life between 2007 and 2010 to demonstrate the failure of an ill-coordinated approach. In 2009 the central government signaled that it wanted to provide 80,000 paramilitary and federal police to help in the fight, but these were too slowly fed into the region without strong local coordination. From the desperation of the peak year of Naxalite (CPI-Maoist) violence in 2010, and then–Prime Minister Singh’s second declaration that Maoist violence was India’s most grave internal security threat, a combination of state\u0002level requests and federal-level policy improvements paved the way for late-arriving successes against the Naxalites.68 The path to success was also paved by corresponding Naxalite failures. Beginning in 2010, the Indian federal government finally undertook several successful ini\u0002tiatives that slowly but steadily spanned the coordination gap between federal and state security forces and linked with improved local economic development aid.69 First, the government took steps to increase the costs to Maoist insurgent group operations—both financial and physical. Second, the central government deployed an additional 66 federal paramilitary security battal\u0002ions, CPSF and others, into the field where the insurgency had been winning against small and poorly trained local police. As noted above, these came slowly and in tranches between 2010 and 2014 but reached an impressive number of more than 200,000 by early 2014.70 India’s mili\u0002tary and its special operations forces (SOF) have not participated directly in the third phase of Naxalite counterinsurgency operations. Instead, SOF units have provided indirect assistance— offering specialized training to Indian Central Armed Police Forces (see appendix B) preparing to deploy to the anti-Maoist counterinsurgency fight.71 Third, the federal government built 444 new police stations in affected areas and regenerated the policing capability in them.72 Fourth, the government established a civil development program in the worst affected areas. Finally, government security forces worked more effectively in a combined action environment where 20 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 economic development and human rights were established in the communities most vulnerable to Naxalite recruiting and propaganda.73 These five national factors interacted with several organizational failures by the Naxalites themselves. First, the Maoists failed to generate a message of systematic economic exploitation to the degree necessary for serious attention in Indian urban areas, where the gulf between rich and poor was great and growing every year. Second, despite their highly publicized violence, the Naxalites never won the “mindspace” in India; the Maoist ideology of class conflict gener\u0002ated limited appeal outside of primitive and tribal areas in India, never resonating in urban ar\u0002eas other than with a marginalized group of activist university students.74 Indian youth moved onto other causes and other areas of activism in the wider Indian economy.75 Third, Naxalites proved to be their own worst enemies. They often splintered into criminal syndicates deal\u0002ing narcotics and running both extortion and kidnapping rackets. This profiteering, evident from as early as 2009–2010, revealed that Naxalism was less about communist ideology or well-coordinated violent insurgent activity and much more about local and regional organized criminal activity, which exploits rather than benefits the lower class (and lower caste) Indian Hindus who live there.76 In self-reflective statements, ministry-level officials in the Indian federal government ac\u0002knowledged that most Naxalite gains before 2010 had come too often because local govern\u0002ments and security officials incorrectly assessed and mishandled the problems of the disgrun\u0002tled Indian minority groups in rural areas. At the same time the central government remained tepid in its involvement—unable to induce state governments to request more assertive federal security assistance and caught in a political conundrum where some of the state government leadership was both courting Naxalite sympathizer votes while simultaneously fighting Naxalite militant cadres. Once the federal government got serious and increased paramilitary security presence with a wider number of local economic development programs, the Naxalites began to wane.77 Attention to a holistic approach by the Indian central government caused the worst of the Naxalite insurgency to recede in a visible manner.78 In 2016 the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India remains a security factor, but one far from the menace publicly announced by then–Prime Minister Singh in 2006 and again in 2010.79 Instead it is now much more of a nuisance, largely a constellation of organized criminal enter\u0002prises with a loose affiliation to a Maoist credo than an ideological insurgency. The socioeco\u0002nomic factors that inspire Naxalite groups remain in place, and this insurgency could again evolve into a more serious threat to local security agents in India. In the poor eastern districts of India, the possibility of a fourth wave of Naxalite insurgency cannot be dismissed if the rich 21 India’s Naxalite Insurgency continue to get richer without the benefits of economic growth filtering down to the people who really need it.80 India’s long slog toward corralling the third phase of its Naxalite insurgency again demon\u0002strated the challenges and strengths of its counterinsurgency framework. State and local govern\u0002ment police forces must fail obviously and admit to their failures before major federal assistance can come forward. Left-wing (or communist) inspired violence mixes awkwardly with Indian electoral politics in many eastern states of the country. Communist political party voters often sympathize with Naxalite grievances but not their violent means. State and local officials thus have incentives to take uncertain and indecisive action with their police and security forces. Too often, they can tolerate incompetence and even human rights abuses by local-level counterin\u0002surgency police and militias, exacerbating wider grievances. They appeal for national economic help while avoiding national security help out of a fear that too much outside intervention might harm their local political interests. Federal-level forces, when these do arrive, come with their own issues. They can lack local knowledge and fail to be sensitive to popular culture and traditions. This leaves them vulnerable to insurgent ambush and to charges of torture or human rights abuses from an uncertain or frightened local population. U.S. Security Engagement with Indian Ministry of Home Affairs U.S. engagement with India in the areas of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency has developed over a 16-year period from January 2000. This engagement has advanced along three parallel lines of interaction. One line has been through bilateral dialogue and exercises between U.S. and Indian SOF, which have focused on counterterrorism training events and conversa\u0002tions. A second line has been through collaboration between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Indian Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This collaboration has focused on criminal investigative techniques; port, rail, and maritime security training and best practices; and a general growth in liaison and information exchange between respective special police and border security agencies. A third line of interaction has evolved in more general bilateral military-to-military exchanges between the national armies, navies, air forces, and coast guards. Advancements in each of these areas have been noteworthy but not comprehensive. For all the noteworthy advances, limitations have remained, especially when it comes to the matter of outside assistance for Indian units and organizations conducting domestic counterinsurgency. The history of special operations training and exercising is most noteworthy. Bilateral U.S.- Indian SOF have undertaken joint exercises that work on interoperability in counterterror\u0002ism and counterinsurgency operation skills and drills. Small-scale counterterrorism training 22 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 exercises have been conducted on a recurring basis since 2002, including exercises in India’s northeast territories where longstanding domestic insurgencies continue.81 Under the broad definition of U.S.-India maritime security cooperation, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) SOF also have been training Indian military special forces officers in counterterrorism, learning from Indian counterterrorism experiences at the same time. In the main, these exercises have focused upon special techniques and capabilities for SOF activities in counterterrorism opera\u0002tions (see appendix C). Despite a decade of offers by U.S. senior commanders and defense officials, Indian leaders declined to have U.S. SOF engage with or provide direct assistance to the MHA paramilitary and police forces optimized for domestic counterterrorism or counterinsurgency operations.82 But in October 2015, India, for the first time, welcomed U.S. SOF to a joint training exercise with its MHA counterterrorism unit, the National Security Guards (NSG).83 This was a meaningful step forward and, as most observers believe, became possible only after the change in perspective ac\u0002companying the government of Prime Minister Modi. Yet the limit of U.S. SOF interaction with that of only the NSG—the single special police unit focused on counterterrorism rather than counterinsurgency operations—is telling. After more than a decade of U.S. offers, the Indian government still remains uncomfortable about direct bilateral counterinsurgency training with its large array of MHA domestic counterinsurgency forces. Washington and New Delhi first established the U.S.-India Counterterrorism Joint Work\u0002ing Group (JWG) in January 2000. Among more than a dozen major steps, the United States and India initiated antiterrorism training programs for Indian law enforcement officials and began a dialogue on cooperation in homeland and internal security.84 First, these programs involved lim\u0002ited military-to-military counterterrorism engagements. Then, after the November 2008 Mum\u0002bai terrorist attack, a more formal set of interactions between DHS and MHA counterterrorism and law enforcement officials began to take shape. Notably, however, neither of these lines of engagement have witnessed the MHA welcoming direct U.S. military or special police assistance for its special police or border police engaged in combating the Naxalite insurgency. In September 2005, USPACOM conducted a counterterrorism tabletop exercise that brought together Indian and American military, diplomatic, law enforcement, and humanitari\u0002an assistance leaders. A U.S. National Guard unit co-trained with Indian troops at India’s Coun\u0002ter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School in Mizoram. U.S. antiterrorism assistance advanced again after the November 2008 terrorist attacks in the commercial district of Mumbai. The U.S. Department of State’s Antiterrorism Assistance Program (ATA) provided enhanced training 23 India’s Naxalite Insurgency consultations with senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officials on the topics of hotel security, rail security, responses to an active shooter incident, as well as major event security management.85 In 2010, the two governments began the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. Since then the dialogue has enabled bilateral cooperation on mutual strategic interests and strengthened “security cooperation through expanded dialogues and exercises as well as shar\u0002ing of advanced technologies.”86 A subsequent 2010 U.S.-India Counterterrorism Cooperation Initiative allows the United States to facilitate capacity-building and training in India across a number of specific areas, including but not limited to: ■ developing investigative skills ■ promoting cooperation between forensic science laboratories ■ establishing procedures to provide mutual investigative assistance ■ improving capabilities to act against money-laundering, counterfeit currency, and terrorist financing ■ trading best practices on mass transit and rail security ■ increasing interactions between coast guards and navies on maritime security ■ exchanging experience and expertise on port and border security ■ enhancing liaison and training between specialist counterterrorism units, including the National Security Guard and its U.S. counterparts.87 Beginning in February 2012, American trainers under the ATA have been training Indian police in cooperation with the MHA. This training includes forensic examination of terrorist crime scenes and advanced explosives incident countermeasures. These courses are also available to state police, for example, in Kolkata (West Bengal). Intelligence agencies of both countries are sharing resources to support specific counterterrorism operations.88 These training courses have had a positive impact upon hundreds of Indian local and national police, including IPS. They have also engaged some members of the MHA special police units such as the Indo-Tibetan Bor\u0002der Police and CPSF. Noteworthy and prudent, these bits of individual training have occurred 24 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 with individual Indian police and paramilitary officers and jawans (junior paramilitary soldiers) who have later participated in counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites and other rebel groups.89 At the same time, though, direct U.S. military engagement with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and security forces units involved in domestic counterinsurgency has remained limited. American military interactions with regular Indian army units also have grown in an im\u0002pressive manner over the past decade. As discussed earlier, Indian, just as American, military and defense leaders are keen to state that India has more joint military training events and exer\u0002cises with the United States than with any other defense partner worldwide.90 Yet India’s civilian defense establishment leadership appears amenable to many military-to-military training and exercise interactions with the United States but continues to view access to military technology to be the litmus test of fruitful bilateral defense relations.91 Although the Indian military highly prizes joint service-to-service interactions and exer\u0002cises, no U.S. military units have been engaged with or even indirectly assisted Indian central police or paramilitary units directly involved in the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations against the Naxalites. In those instances in which the U.S. military and DHS per\u0002sonnel have had interaction with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and paramilitary forces, the rule has been that indirect general skills training is acceptable for Indian leadership, but specific engagement and activities directly with Indian domestic insurgency forces is alto\u0002gether something else. Some analysts have recommended that the United States formally inject direct domestic counterinsurgency assistance into the U.S.-India security relationship. In 2013, one such ana\u0002lyst, Haider Ali Hussein Mullick, made a robust proposal, stating that the United States should formally generate a $400 million India counterinsurgency initiative, jointly run by the Depart\u0002ment of Defense (DOD), State, and DHS.92 He proposed that this initiative should bundle to\u0002gether the indirect assistance provided by the ATA and DOD International Military Education and Training program, as well as establish a Foreign Military Finance Account for India (where one then did not exist) and apportion other money into DHS and Justice department accounts to better enable Federal Bureau of Information resources for its India-focused international po\u0002lice training program. In this well-intentioned recommendation, U.S. largesse could be used to provide vital equipment to India’s CRPF, including armored personnel vehicles, mine-resistant vehicles, flak jackets, GPS trackers, and night-vision goggles. As Indian attack helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were deemed vital for providing counterinsurgency ground 25 India’s Naxalite Insurgency support, this proposal provided for U.S. funding to assist the Indian air force in creating dedi\u0002cated air surveillance and support for the CRPF—including helicopter and UAV support.93 Noble in intent, Mullick’s recommendation of a major U.S. push to provide direct assis\u0002tance to Indian domestic counterinsurgency units and operations remains as misguided today as it was in 2013. Likewise, periodic offers by U.S. defense officials of direct U.S. military assis\u0002tance to Indian counterinsurgency forces are similarly well intentioned but off target.94 These and similar initiatives ultimately push unhelpfully against Indian protection of its absolute sov\u0002ereignty in domestic counterinsurgency operations. Moreover, even if India were to unexpect\u0002edly welcome direct U.S. military and whole-of-government support for its domestic counter\u0002insurgency activities, that very success would create significant problems for the growing but delicate U.S.-India security relationship. These problems are evident in the patterns observed during Indian counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites. Direct American support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations (such as those against the Naxalites) would quickly expose significant divergence between views in Washington and Indian cultural and political concerns with its domestic insurgents. First, In\u0002dians are historically tolerant of long, protracted counterinsurgency operations, including the four-and-a-half-decade Naxalite rebellion, a six-decade swirl of insurgency in northeast India, and the insurgency and rebellion extant in Jammu and Kashmir since 1947. American patience with such protracted counterinsurgency operations has not been a hallmark of its international ventures over the past century. Second, Indian domestic insurgencies have a political cadence and rhythm about them that is alien to American sensibilities. In all three phases of the Naxalite insurgency, state and local political dynamics played to Naxalite sympathizer vote banks, allowing insurgent activi\u0002ties to grow to an uncomfortable level. In the second phase and especially the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency, Indian national police and paramilitary assistance began with limited but targeted security help for local authorities that focused upon managing major events—like election security—but then quickly vanished. Only when the political calculus of local, state, and national officials aligned did coordinated and effective policing, paramilitary, and local as\u0002sistance programs come together. American patience with the dynamics of this Indian political rhythm would be sorely tried. Third, with much of India’s Naxalite insurgency featuring organized criminal activity as its underpinning by 2014–2016, it is arguably more useful and feasible for the United States and India to focus meaningful collaboration on individual policing techniques and investigative activities to counter these dimensions of residual Naxalism. There will be less Indian resistance 26 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 to this kind of DHS-to-MHA support. Thereafter, the focus of the U.S. military and its SOF can then better orient on wider regional and international counterterrorism activities. In addition to these historically supported cautions, direct American training and equip\u0002ment support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations might run afoul of U.S. legisla\u0002tive mandates and human rights standards. All U.S. assistance to foreign security forces must conform to what is known as the Leahy Law, named for legislative author Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). One part of the law applies to State Department foreign assistance programs and the second applies to DOD training and assistance programs for the security forces of a foreign country. Both versions prohibit any U.S. security assistance if the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense have credible information that a military, paramilitary, or police unit of a foreign government has committed a gross violation of human rights in the conduct of its activities— past or present. The law allows for an exception (or waiver) permitting resumption of security assistance if the Secretary of State or Defense reports to Congress that the government of the assisted country is taking effective steps to bring the violating members of the security forces to justice.95 Direct U.S. assistance to India’s paramilitary and police units combatting the Naxalite insurgency (as others) could quickly run into a problem with the Leahy Law. There have been frequent reports of Indian local police units’ involvement in human rights violations against innocents in the Naxalite insurgency areas.96 Indian central policy forces, including units from the CRPF, have been accused of human rights abuses and torture against apprehended militants and presumed supporters in Naxalite-afflicted areas.97 It is hard to imagine Indian pride react\u0002ing well to American demands for certification of the human rights corrections made on its national counterinsurgency paramilitary forces. It also is hard to imagine the U.S.-India security relationship holding up well if, in order to secure training and equipment for its already well-supported national paramilitary units, New Delhi must face repetitive Leahy Law inquiries. Indeed, in a country with growing wealth and a proud belief in the relative successes of its autonomous, indigenous paramilitary counterin\u0002surgency forces, U.S. direct assistance (with strings) is not likely to be well received.98 At the least, such conditioned assistance would strain security relations that both sides desire to see improve. At the worst, the outcome might set back bilateral security progress on far more im\u0002portant U.S.-India security initiatives including those involving joint maritime security activi\u0002ties in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean, interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence sharing and broader operations. 27 India’s Naxalite Insurgency Lessons Learned and Policy Implications for U.S.-India Relations A review of the history of Indian approach to dealing with its Naxalite insurgency indi\u0002cates the unique nature of New Delhi’s approach to domestic security. The limited engagement with the United States on military and security assistance offers also indicates the continuing barriers inhibiting a deep and unbridled bilateral security alliance at this time. A decade of U.S. interaction with India on the Naxalite insurgency reinforces the notion that Washington should not expect New Delhi to become a tightly coupled military ally anytime soon. Instead, New Del\u0002hi is more likely to be a friendly strategic partner with the United States where mutual security interests align, while interacting more often in a restrained and limited manner where U.S. and Indian security interests and prerogatives do not well align—as in the case of the Naxalites.99 Given this insight, U.S. policymakers should focus on bilateral counterterrorism and coun\u0002terinsurgency security cooperation efforts toward externally sponsored Islamist terrorist groups and, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, against actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns. As a complement, U.S. military assistance programs focusing on technical skills and practices for individual Indian police, paramilitary, and SOF will remain most promising and prominent for the foreseeable future. 28 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Appendix A.

Under the reciprocal agreement, both New Delhi and Washington would have the ability, but not the obligation, to assist each other’s armed forces with simple military logistics. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) would allow the United States to supply India with its proprietary encrypted communications equipment and systems, allowing secure peacetime and wartime communication between high-level military leaders on both sides. CISMOA would extend this capability to Indian and U.S. military assets, including aircraft and ships. The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) would set a framework through which the United States could share sensitive data to aid targeting and navigation with India.

On May 22, there were nearly simultaneous bombings of two movie theaters in New Delhi by a Sikh terrorist organization, Babbar Khalsa International, which many thought was defunct. The attacks left 1 person dead and more than 60 injured. On October 29, a series of explosions in crowded marketplaces and on a public bus in New Delhi killed approximately 60 and injured more than 150 on the eve of Diwali, India’s most important Hindu holiday. The Indian government blamed the designated foreign terrorist organiza\u0002tion Lashkar e-Tayyiba for the attack.

But it also came about after Naxalite groups began to focus on controlling areas rich in natural resources such as iron and destroying state infrastructure such as railroads, telephone exchanges, and industrial plants. By 2010 Naxalite presence overlapped critical areas such as Bihar, Jharkhand, and Orissa, which contain the bulk of India’s iron ore, and Andhra Pradesh has large reserves of bauxite, 38 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 key inputs to Indian industry. Naxalites had also come to dominate areas containing 85 percent of the country’s coal resources, which are used to power 55 percent of India’s energy supply and 75 percent of its electricity. These economic realities made piecemeal solutions and state-level toleration of Naxalite activities untenable—driving better coordination. See “Left Wing Extremism (LWE) Division,” available at.

Most recently, U.S. congressional conditionality on the Kerry-Berman-Lugar strategic assistance package to Pakistan of 2009 requiring that Pakistan’s military relinquish absolute control of its general officer selection process to civilian oversight substantially strained U.S.-Pakistan relations at a moment that Washington aimed to make them tighter. India in 2016 is not Pakistan of 2009, but the caution against unhelpful conditionality remains a worthy one. See S. 1707, “Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009,” 111th Cong., 1st sess.

    "full_text": "# RedNovember Targets Government, Defense, and Technology Organizations _Note: The analysis cut-off date for this report was July 25, 2025_ ## Executive Summary In July 2024, Insikt Group publicly [reported](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0716.pdf) on TAG-100, a threat activity group conducting suspected cyber-espionage activity targeting high-profile government, intergovernmental, and private sector organizations globally using the open-source, multi-platform Go backdoor Pantegana. At the time, we did not attribute this activity to a particular country; however, after reviewing all available evidence, we assess that TAG-100 is highly likely a Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group. Accordingly, Insikt Group now tracks this group under the designation RedNovember. Between June 2024 and July 2025, RedNovember (which overlaps with Storm-2077) targeted perimeter appliances of high-profile organizations globally and used the Go-based backdoor Pantegana and Cobalt Strike as part of its intrusions. The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms. Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified new likely victims, which include a ministry of foreign affairs in central Asia, a state security organization in Africa, a European government directorate, and a Southeast Asian government. RedNovember also likely compromised at least two United States (US) defense contractors, a European engine manufacturer, and a trade-focused intergovernmental cooperation body in Southeast Asia. We observed RedNovember reconnoitering and likely compromising edge devices for initial access, including SonicWall, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), F5 BIG-IP, Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect, Sophos SSL VPN, and Fortinet FortiGate instances, as well as Outlook Web Access (OWA) instances and Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN appliances. RedNovember’s activity exemplifies the ability to combine weaponized proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits with open-source post-exploitation frameworks such as Pantegana, lowering the entry barrier for less-capable threat actors. It also allows higher-tier groups to refrain from using customized tools during operations in which they are less concerned with being detected or in which heightened attribution obfuscation is desirable. Insikt Group followed responsible disclosure procedures in advance of this publication per Recorded Future's notification policy. ## Key Findings - RedNovember continues to rely on command-and-control (C2) frameworks (Pantegana and Cobalt Strike) and open-source backdoors (SparkRAT) for its operations. - The threat group has significantly broadened its targeting, including by conducting spearphishing and vulnerability exploitation attempts against entities in the US Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and space organizations in Europe. - At least some of the RedNovember activity that Insikt Group observed, including in Taiwan and Panama, took place in close proximity to geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China. - RedNovember has also increasingly focused its initial access efforts on targeting edge devices, including security solutions such as VPNs, firewalls, load balancers, virtualization infrastructure, and email servers. - In April 2025, the threat group conducted a campaign focused on the reconnaissance and targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices across multiple countries. Specific targets included a major US newspaper and a specialized US engineering and military contractor. ## Background RedNovember (previously tracked as TAG-100 and overlapping with Storm-2077) is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber-espionage group that leverages open-source tools and exploits internet-facing devices to target government, intergovernmental, and private sector organizations globally. Insikt Group has previously publicly [reported](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0716.pdf) on RedNovember’s use of the multi-platform Go-based backdoor Pantegana and other offensive security tools, including Cobalt Strike and SparkRAT, coupled with exploitation of perimeter appliances, to conduct reconnaissance, initial access, and probable compromise activities. RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution, a tactic that aligns with broader state-sponsored cyber-espionage trends that Insikt Group has observed. Combining weaponized proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits and open-source tools enables RedNovember to operate at scale. RedNovember’s activity highlights the persistent vulnerabilities of perimeter devices, which remain a significant risk vector due to limited visibility and logging capabilities. RedNovember is one of multiple [other](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf) Chinese state-sponsored threat groups that are increasingly achieving initial access to targets by targeting vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices, including security products. Targeting internet-facing devices has proven to be an effective way for Chinese state-sponsored threat groups to scale initial access and achieve initial footholds in large numbers of organizations ahead of more targeted follow-on activity. ## Technical Analysis Since our initial [public report](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0716.pdf) on its activity, RedNovember has continued to use the Pantegana C2 framework and Cobalt Strike as part of its intrusion activity. From our visibility and collection, RedNovember also highly likely continues to use ExpressVPN to administer its servers and may, with realistic probability, have started using other VPNs such as Warp VPN to remotely connect to its infrastructure. **_Figure 1:_** _Overview of RedNovember operations (Source: Recorded Future)_ While monitoring RedNovember’s active C2 servers, Insikt Group observed a number of victims on a global scale across the public and private sectors, but concentrated in the following verticals: aerospace and defense, government, and professional services. In addition to suspected compromise activity by RedNovember, we observed other network communications between multiple organizations and C2 servers associated with RedNovember, likely reflecting, at a minimum, general browsing activity and potentially reconnaissance efforts by the threat group. While the activity could be indicative of an intent to compromise, in these cases, there is currently insufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion. The terms “compromise,” “targeting,” “reconnaissance,” and “browsing\" are used specifically throughout this report to clarify the kind of activity observed. For example, where we assess that RedNovember compromised an entity, we will use terms such as “compromise” and “victim.” ### Victimology, Targeting, and Reconnaissance Between H2 2024 and H2 2025, RedNovember compromised, targeted, and reconnoitered organizations on a global scale. In particular, RedNovember heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, and, in April 2025, it focused its reconnaissance on over 30 Panamanian government organizations. **_Figure 2:_** _Mapping of countries with organizations compromised or targeted by RedNovember (Source: Recorded Future)_ #### Targeting of Government, Intergovernmental, and Diplomatic Entities RedNovember has targeted government and diplomatic organizations across many countries, as well as intergovernmental organizations. Insikt Group has identified the likely targeting of Outlook Web Access (OWA) portals belonging to a South American country prior to that country's state visit to China. Similar RedNovember activity has been observed targeting OWA portals belonging to ministries of foreign affairs in Southeast Asia and South America. Since at least mid-2024, RedNovember has highly likely compromised the following targets: - A 3CX web client instance associated with the ministry responsible for museums in a western European country - A Zimbra Collaboration Suite server associated with a Southeast Asian country - A Fortinet FortiGate appliance likely associated with the foreign affairs ministry of an East Asian country - A Huawei router likely associated with a Southeast Asian government - An African government’s Cisco ASA appliance Insikt Group also observed communications suggesting a long-running compromise of an intergovernmental organization based in Southeast Asia at least up until March 2025. Other Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, including RedDelta, have previously targeted official intergovernmental organizations in Southeast Asia, likely for the purposes of espionage. Additionally, in March and April 2025, Insikt Group observed evidence suggesting the likely compromise of an additional intergovernmental organization based in Southeast Asia. ##### Taiwan Between December 9, 2024, and December 16, 2024, Insikt Group observed communications from a RedNovember malicious server, _198\\[.\\]98\\[.\\]50\\[.\\]218_, also hosting a Pantegana C2, to a location in Taiwan that is home to a Taiwan Air Force military airbase and is also a primary location for semiconductor research and development. On December 9, 2024, China [conducted](https://www.dw.com/en/china-breaks-silence-on-large-military-drills-around-taiwan/a-71042704) a surprise military exercise around Taiwan, which involved around 90 warships and coast guard vessels and included simulating attacks on foreign ships and practicing the blockading of sea routes. In April 2025, RedNovember also conducted reconnaissance against infrastructure associated with two national scientific research organizations in Taiwan, including one focusing on research and development work related to semiconductors. ##### South Korea Insikt Group first observed RedNovember targeting South Korea in late August 2024. Between late August 2024 and March 2025, RedNovember compromised a Korean nonprofit organization in the financial services sector. The organization was observed communicating with several of the threat group’s Pantegana C2 servers. Korean organizations were also targeted as part of RedNovember’s April 2025 exploitation wave against Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices, such as when Insikt Group observed the suspected compromise of a nuclear safety-related organization in South Korea funded by the Korean government, which is a top research and development entity and has been significantly involved in South Korea’s supercomputing and quantum computing efforts. RedNovember also conducted reconnaissance against ICS VPN appliances on a Korean telecommunications company, a Korean marine vessel classification organization, and a Korean national research university. #### Broad Targeting of Panamanian Government Entities Between April 22 and April 24, 2025, Insikt Group observed a significant effort by RedNovember to scan and likely reconnoiter over 30 Panamanian organizations, the majority of which are related to the Panamanian government. Targeted devices and organizations included Panamaian government bodies focused on finance, international relations, and transportation. The targeting also included several other government ministries, including ones focused on land and economic development and emergency services organizations. The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s visit to Panama in early April 2025, and may have been triggered at least in part by several remarks made by US President Donald Trump during January and February 2025 that suggested US interest in asserting control over the Panama Canal. On April 9, 2025, Secretary Hegseth [announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an “expanded partnership” with Panama to counter Chinese influence in the canal. Additionally, in February 2025, following a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Panama President José Raúl Mulino [announced](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/02/04/panama-drops-belt-and-road-agreement-with-china-after-us-pressure_6737775_4.html) that the country would formally leave China’s flagship foreign development project Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), by not renewing the current Memorandum of Understanding, and that Panama would also [review](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/panama-said-to-mull-canceling-port-deal-with-hong-kong-firm) its contracts with Hong Kong firm Hutchison PPC, which currently manages Panama’s ports of Balboa and Cristóbal. An agreement on the sale involving the two ports to a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock and MSC (Mediterranean Shipping Company), set to be signed during the first week of April 2025, had [reportedly](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-panama-canal-take-back-military-china-blackrock-rcna199438) been delayed under pressure from China. **_Figure 3:_** _Breakdown of RedNovember reconnaissance and compromise activity by country between June 2024 and May 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)_ #### Targeting of US and European Defense and Aerospace Organizations In July 2024, Insikt Group observed RedNovember conduct a broad reconnaissance campaign exclusively targeting prominent aerospace and defense organizations, with a particular focus on the US. This activity involved suspected port scanning from the RedNovember IP address _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]57_ against these networks. There was no evidence to suggest a successful compromise or exploitation took place against these entities. However, this activity demonstrated that RedNovember was expanding its targeting to include the US defense industrial base and other global defense organizations. In the first half of 2025, Insikt Group has observed further RedNovember reconnaissance activity and compromises targeting this sector. In April 2025, communications were observed between a RedNovember reconnaissance and vulnerability exploitation server and infrastructure associated with a European space focused research center. As part of its April 2025 targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices, RedNovember targeted a specialized US engineering and military contractor. Insikt Group observed direct connections between the same RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 and exploitation server and two of the organization’s ICS VPN Internet-facing endpoints over a period of two days; however, there is currently no sufficient evidence to conclude that RedNovember succeeded in compromising the target. Also in April 2025, RedNovember conducted extensive reconnaissance against an IP address space associated with a higher education institution associated with the US Navy. Insikt Group did not observe evidence of the organization being compromised. #### Targeting of the Private Sector ##### European Manufacturing Companies In March 2025, Insikt Group identified direct reconnaissance and communications with RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2s that indicated RedNovember’s possible compromise of a European engine manufacturer. The threat group targeted a SonicWall VPN device and login pages for the company’s F5 BIG-IP devices and VDI environment. RedNovember also browsed to a server that hosts a SonicWall SonicOS and a SonicWall SSL VPN instance for a UK-based defense contractor. Additionally, also in March 2025, Insikt Group observed RedNovember-controlled IP address _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]24_ browsing to a SonicWall SonicOS and SonicWall SSL-VPN instance of a United Kingdom (UK)-based company focusing on bespoke cable harnessing, including for aerospace, military and defense, and medical applications. ##### Law Firms (Globally) The group compromised a SonicWall SonicOS and SSL VPN device belonging to an American law firm in April 2025. RedNovember also targeted IP addresses, including a Palo Alto GlobalProtect Gateway Httpd sever, associated with a global law firm that has been involved in a debt restructuring project with a Chinese company. ##### Taiwanese Technology Companies Between at least July 2024 and March 2025, RedNovember compromised a Taiwanese IT company using the Pantegana C2 IP addresses _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]57\\[.\\]116_ and _205\\[.\\]185\\[.\\]126\\[.\\]208_. RedNovember has shown particular interest in Taiwanese companies, particularly ones related to semiconductors and technology, as well as Taiwanese government bodies related to science. ##### US Oil and Gas Companies In April 2025, RedNovember conducted reconnaissance of two American oil and gas companies. Insikt Group had previously publicly [reported](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-100-uses-open-source-tools-in-suspected-global-espionage-campaign) on RedNovember targeting American utilities organizations in 2024, in the context of a campaign targeting Palo Alto GlobalProtect devices. #### Broad Targeting of Fijian Government, Financial, Transportation, and Media Entities In July 2024, Insikt Group identified a surge in RedNovember activity targeting over 50 Fijian organizations via the actor-controlled IP addresses _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]57_ and _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]47\\[.\\]6_. This activity exclusively targeted OWA and Sophos UTM login portals of these organizations. Notable targets included multiple Fijian financial institutions, transportation authorities, media, and government organizations. In particular, the identified targeting of multiple land, sea, and air transportation authorities aligns with ongoing Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) interests within Fiji ( [1](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3243118/fiji-woos-china-upgrade-strategically-important-ports-even-debt-concerns-mount), [2](https://fijionenews.com.fj/fiji-enters-into-300m-china-bri-deal/)), exemplifying RedNovember activity correlating with Chinese state interests. #### Surge Targeting of Edge Devices and Vulnerability Exploitation RedNovember has repeatedly conducted surge targeting of specific edge devices following the disclosure of vulnerabilities and the publication of PoC exploit code for those same devices. Insikt Group has also observed evidence that the group has targeted the Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190) and a Microsoft Exchange server. RedNovember has a history of targeting vulnerabilities in edge devices. In April 2024, following the release of a PoC exploit for the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect firewall remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability CVE-2024-3400, the group likely [conducted](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-100-uses-open-source-tools-in-suspected-global-espionage-campaign) reconnaissance and exploitation activity against Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect appliances associated with American education, finance, legal, local government, and utilities organizations. ##### Targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure VPN in April 2025 In April 2025, RedNovember conducted a campaign focused on the reconnaissance and targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices across multiple countries. Specific targets included a major American newspaper, a specialized US engineering and military contractor, and two prominent Korean institutes associated with scientific research and nuclear regulation. ##### Likely Targeting of Check Point VPN Gateways Following CVE-2024-24919 PoC Publication From June 3 to June 6, 2024, Insikt Group observed outbound communications from RedNovember IP address _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]47\\[.\\]6_ to Check Point VPN gateways linked to at least 60 organizations, mainly in Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the US (see **Figure 4**). This activity appeared relatively opportunistic, with minimal themes identified across targeted organizations. Notably, on May 30, 2024, a PoC exploit was [published](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/) for the arbitrary file read vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 affecting multiple Check Point VPN gateway products, which led to widespread [exploitation](https://www.greynoise.io/blog/whats-going-on-with-checkpoint-cve-2024-24919) in the wild by multiple threat actors. While unconfirmed, the timing of the RedNovember activity suggests that the group may have attempted to exploit this vulnerability following the publication of this PoC. Similar behavior by RedNovember was previously noted concerning the targeting of Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, which closely aligned with the release of a public PoC for the arbitrary file creation vulnerability CVE-2024-3400. **_Figure 4:_** _Breakdown of RedNovember Check Point VPN targeting by country in early June 2024_ _(Source: Recorded Future)_ ### Tools Used by RedNovember #### LESLIELOADER and SparkRAT Insikt Group identified two LESLIELOADER samples used by RedNovember to load SparkRAT. The group has previously used a variant of the [publicly available](https://github.com/HZzz2/go-shellcode-loader) Go-based loader LESLIELOADER to load SparkRAT, including in a chain documented by Kroll [research](https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/leslieloader-undocumented-loader-observed?) in March 2024. **SHA256 Hash** **SparkRAT C2 IP Address** `8679a25c78e104c6e74996b75882e378f420614fe1379ee9c1e266a11ffa096d` 209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]57 `06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2` 107\\[.\\]189\\[.\\]8\\[.\\]240 **_Table 1:_** _RedNovember LESLIELOADER samples used to load SparkRAT (Source: Recorded Future)_ The 06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2 sample was first uploaded to a public malware repository within a ZIP file (SHA256: 675874ac8fbe66e76244759ae398a4d30da84ef2435a1384c4be549ca9eba18b), which also contained a PDF lure document (SHA256: 1e37efcd3cd647e6ce5414ae8e353ca690c2d3f7a701a1cc2ec29a4813f5c90b). The PDF lure, which was highly likely delivered via email-based spearphishing, purported to come from the IT department of a US Navy contractor company, and directed targets receiving the file to download and install the LESLIELOADER sample from the threat actor-controlled malicious domain _download\\[.\\]offiec\\[.\\]us\\[.\\]kg_. The LESLIELOADER executable masqueraded as a security patch for VMware software, and its filename included the specific name of the US contractor company being targeted. #### LESLIELOADER and Cobalt Strike In May 2025, Insikt Group identified two additional samples of LESLIELOADER used to load Cobalt Strike Beacon in memory. **SHA256 Hash** **Cobalt Strike C2 IP Address** `134ed0407956ff1ac59f38e89742e357cc3be565cbaff18b424ed1bcfd130978` 47\\[.\\]103\\[.\\]218\\[.\\]35 `2bee2cc42322e928bfa0650c5416b14bc0200f2d1156304179d63982baa835dc` **_Table 2:_** _RedNovember LESLIELOADER samples used to load Cobalt Strike (Source: Recorded Future)_ Notably, in this case, the server was hosted in China, specifically on ALIBABA-CN-NET (AS37963), and the Cobalt Strike service was run on TCP port 80. #### Additional Malicious Documents Insikt Group also identified a malicious Word document directing victims to the RedNovember-controlled domain _login\\[.\\]offiec\\[.\\]us\\[.\\]kg_ (SHA256: 9a1077f57bac5610d44ac46a8958dd5469522a3db466f164f4dfeada73847b79), specifically to the URL: _hxxps://login\\[.\\]offiec\\[.\\]us\\[.\\]kg/ms-help.html._ The subdomain name “offiec” could be a typosquat reference to the Microsoft Office suite. The file was last modified on August 14, 2024, and was first submitted to a public malware scanner on August 15, 2024. The `ms-help.html` file (SHA256: dba860617762bc713771de351026eb683546b37489fa0359064948f263438030) downloaded by the Word document appears to have been an exploit for the Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-3019). #### Other Potential Tools Insikt Group has observed RedNovember using multiple file-sharing websites and tools to scan for vulnerabilities. **pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk** In October 2024, Insikt Group observed connections between a RedNovember server and the website _pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk_, an anonymous file-sharing website. This website has been previously [highlighted](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/ivanti-post-exploitation-lateral-movement) by Mandiant as being used by a suspected China-based threat actor, UNC5266, as part of an exploitation campaign targeting Ivanti devices in 2024. UNC5266 allegedly used the file-sharing website to stage malware payloads and attempted to retrieve them through `curl` and `wget` requests to specific URL paths on the website. Insikt Group does not currently have evidence to substantiate any links between UNC5266 and RedNovember. Since at least January 23, 2025, and as of July 22, 2025, the domain’s landing page displays a Chinese-language message which in translation reads as: “Statement on the abuse of ‘pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk’ by cyber attackers.” The statement acknowledges that recent public reporting has highlighted suspect misuse of the platform by cyber threat actors, stating that it has no connection to such incidents and that it abides by applicable laws and regulations. According to the statement, the platform is temporarily unavailable while work is being conducted to “optimize the download logic and add authentication verification.” **_Figure 5:_** _Statement on the pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk main page (Source: urlscan.io)_ **PortSwigger** RedNovember connected on multiple occasions to the PortSwigger website. PortSwigger provides tools for web application security testing and scanning. Its main product, Burp Suite, is widely used by security researchers — and, occasionally, by threat actors — to test and scan web applications for vulnerabilities. **Filemail** RedNovember connected to a dedicated Filemail instance with a domain of _3008\\[.\\]filemail\\[.\\]com_. Filemail is a cloud-based file transfer service solution that allows users to upload, send, and share large files via email or shareable links. **Acunetix** In at least one instance, a RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 server ran the vulnerability scanner tool Acunetix, suggesting that the threat group may also be using this tool as part of its reconnaissance activity. **Hacker Target** RedNovember used one of its servers to access the _hackertarget\\[.\\]com_ website in April 2025. Hacker Target provides a free online vulnerability scanner platform with multiple features, including Nmap and ZMap scans, and domain and server profiling. **Wayback Machine** In April 2025, RedNovember used at least two of its servers to navigate to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Insikt Group did not have visibility into what the threat group queried in the archive. **Crt\\[.\\]sh** Also in April 2025, RedNovember accessed _crt\\[.\\]sh_, a free online TLS certificate transparency service that allows users to look up TLS certificate logs by domain or certificate hash. **Gofile\\[.\\]io** Additionally, in April 2025, RedNovember connected to the free cloud storage service _gofile\\[.\\]io_, suggesting that the threat actor might have uploaded or browsed files from an account it held on the platform. As highlighted above, RedNovember has previously used similar services, such as the aforementioned _pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk_. ## Mitigations Organizations should take the following measures to detect and mitigate observed TTPs associated with RedNovember activity: - Detect and block malicious infrastructure such as Pantegana, SparkRAT, and Cobalt Strike C2 servers in real time via the [Recorded Future® Threat Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence) module. - [Recorded Future® Third-Party Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence) module users can monitor real-time output to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity involving key vendors and partners within physical, network, and software supply chains. - By monitoring Infrastructure Analysis events, Recorded Future customers can alert on and monitor RedNovember C2 IP addresses. - By monitoring Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA), Recorded Future customers can alert on and proactively monitor infrastructure involved in notable communication to known RedNovember C2 IP addresses. - Ensure a risk-based approach for patching vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and those exploited in the wild as determined through the [Recorded Future® Vulnerability Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence) module. The public availability of exploit code can substantially increase the likelihood of mass exploitation ( [1](https://www.securityweek.com/poc-published-fortinet-vulnerability-mass-exploitation-attempts-begin/), [2](https://www.securityweek.com/exploitation-of-palo-alto-firewall-vulnerability-picking-up-after-poc-release/), [3](https://www.securityweek.com/mass-exploitation-of-citrix-bleed-vulnerability-underway/)). To specifically protect against some Chinese state-sponsored groups, pay particular attention to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in external-facing appliances within your environment. - Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking connection attempts to and from — the external IP addresses and domains linked in **Appendix A**. - Ensure security monitoring and detection capabilities are in place for all external-facing services and devices. Monitor for follow-on activity likely to occur following exploitation of these external-facing services, such as the deployment of web shells, backdoors, or reverse shells, as well as subsequent lateral movement to internal networks. - Regularly audit internet-facing and perimeter appliances, and reduce attack surfaces by disabling both internet-facing and internal interfaces or portals where no longer required, and by reducing appliances exposed to the internet to only those that are strictly required. - Consider logging capabilities and security product support when initially procuring network appliances, in order to be appropriately positioned to detect and respond to threats. - Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information; consider implementing multi-factor authentication and extremely restricted access and storage on systems only accessible via an internal network. - Focus on defense-in-depth strategies, such as detecting post-exploitation persistence, discovery, and lateral movement activities, as well as unusual network communications. Such strategies can aid detection and response to intrusions arising from the exploitation of both known and zero-day vulnerabilities. ## Outlook RedNovember has historically targeted a diverse range of countries and sectors, suggesting broad and changing intelligence requirements. Some of its activity appears to align with a military affiliation or military-adjacent interests, such as the targeting of specific entities in the US DIB, or the targeting of Taiwan around the time of China’s military exercises in Taiwan. However, there are different sets of targeting that do not closely match this pattern: for example, the targeting of law firms, newspaper organizations, and a Christian denomination in the US. Other clusters of RedNovember activity signal a clear interest in foreign governments and foreign policy, such as the targeting of international multilateral organizations based in Southeast Asia and government ministries in several Southeast Asian countries and South American countries, as well as the reconnaissance against dozens of Panamanian government departments in April 2025. Based on its visibility and collection, Insikt Group has observed that RedNovember’s activity to date has primarily focused on several key geographies, including the US, Southeast Asia, the Pacific region, and South America. While targets and victims have also been identified in Europe and at least one in Africa, the overall volume of activity directed toward these areas has been notably lower than that observed in the primary regions of focus. From a sector perspective, RedNovember continued targeting government organizations in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and South America, intergovernmental organizations in Southeast Asia, and religious organizations. However, since our first public report on the group, we have also observed RedNovember expand its targeting to defense and aerospace organizations, the private sector, and at least two news outlets. Insikt Group anticipates that RedNovember, along with other Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups, will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release. ## Appendix A: Indicators of Compromise ``` Domains: aeifile[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg citrix[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg cna[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg download[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg gp[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg login[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg test[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg vpn[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg vpn1[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg RedNovember Pantegana C2 IP Addresses: 45[.]61[.]187[.]124 198[.]98[.]50[.]218 198[.]98[.]53[.]163 198[.]98[.]61[.]155 209[.]141[.]37[.]254 205[.]185[.]126[.]208 205[.]185[.]124[.]24 209[.]141[.]42[.]131 209[.]141[.]46[.]83 209[.]141[.]57[.]116 RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 IP Address: 47[.]103[.]218[.]35 RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 URLs: hxxp://47[.]103[.]218[.]35/pixel hxxp://47[.]103[.]218[.]35/GSjY LESLIELOADER SHA256 hashes: 06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2 134ed0407956ff1ac59f38e89742e357cc3be565cbaff18b424ed1bcfd130978 2bee2cc42322e928bfa0650c5416b14bc0200f2d1156304179d63982baa835dc 8679a25c78e104c6e74996b75882e378f420614fe1379ee9c1e266a11ffa096d ZIP file SHA256 hash: 675874ac8fbe66e76244759ae398a4d30da84ef2435a1384c4be549ca9eba18b PDF lure SHA256 hash: 1e37efcd3cd647e6ce5414ae8e353ca690c2d3f7a701a1cc2ec29a4813f5c90b Malicious Follina Word document SHA256 hashes: 9a1077f57bac5610d44ac46a8958dd5469522a3db466f164f4dfeada73847b79 dba860617762bc713771de351026eb683546b37489fa0359064948f263438030 ``` ## Appendix B: MITRE ATT&CK Techniques **Tactic: Technique** **ATT&CK Code** **Resource Development:** Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server [T1583.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003/) **Reconnaissance:** Gather Victim Network Information: Network Security Appliances [T1590.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1590/006/) **Initial Access:** Exploit Public-Facing Application [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/) **Initial Access**: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/) **Execution:** User Execution: Malicious Link [T1204.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001/) **Execution:** User Execution: Malicious File [T1204.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/) **Command and Control:** Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols [T1071.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001/) **Command and Control:** Non-Standard Port [T1571](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571/) ## Appendix C: LESLIELOADER YARA Rule ``` rule MAL_LESLIELOADER { meta: author = \"Insikt Group, Recorded Future\" date = \"2024-11-14\" description = \"Detects LESLIELOADER Malware used by RedNovember\" version = \"1.0\" hash = \"8679a25c78e104c6e74996b75882e378f420614fe1379ee9c1e266a11ffa096d\" hash = \"06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2\" malware = \"LESLIELOADER\" malware_id = \"u-6JwI\" category = \"MALWARE\" strings: $s1 = \".DecrptogAES\" $s2 = \".UnPaddingText1\" // AES key 1 $k1a = \"LeslieCh\" $k1b = \"eungKwok\" // AES key 2 $k2a = { 33 44 37 35 45 34 43 39 } $k2b = { 42 33 32 41 42 45 31 37 } condition: uint16be(0) == 0x4d5a and all of ($s*) and 2 of ($k*) } ``` ## Appendix D: RedNovember Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis",

It continues to be so.”_– Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.\\[i\\] _From Ideology To Warfare_ The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. _Resurgence_ Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. ### A New Strategy _“We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.”_-Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. _Overruns_ On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • **Used improvised explosive devices.** Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • **Assassinated officials.** In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • **Destroyed police infrastructure.** Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj _Systems Disruption_ At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? ### The Deviant Economic Engine _“The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.”_-Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. _The Revolutionary Tax_ In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. _A Revolutionary Tax Economy_ To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • **Mining.** Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • **Narcotics.** India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • **Informal tolls.** Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. ### A Strategic Half-Life _“It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they_ _look to the Naxals for justice.”_–Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future. _Sources:_ i Mahendra Kumawat, “Naxal Movement Has Shown Tremendous Grit,” Rediff News, April 9, 2010. ii Waquar Ahmed, Amitabh Kundu, and Richard Peet, India’s New Economic Policy: A Critical Analysis (New York: Routledge, 2011). iii Bibhudatta Pradhan and Santosh Kumar, “Pillai to End Maoist Grip on $80 Billion Investments,” Bloomberg Businessweek, September 17, 2010. iv Government of India, “Fact Sheet On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),” Ministry of Commerce and Industry, February 11, 2011, http://dipp.nic.in/fdi\\_statistics/india\\_FDI\\_February2011.pdf (accessed March 23, 2011). v Rahul Nilakantan and Saurabh Singhal, “The Economic Costs Of Naxalite Violence and the Economic Benefits of a Unique Robust Security Response,” 2010. http://www.aae.wisc.edu/mwiedc/papers/2011/Singhal\\_Saurabh.pdf (accessed April 3, 2011). vi “Chhattisgarh’s Entire Forest Area A Minefield?,” Times of India, May 10, 2010. vii Manoj Prasad, “Former Jharkhand CM Marandi on Their Hitlist, Naxals Kill Son, 17 More,” Indian Express, October 28, 2007. viii Press Trust of India, “Maoists Storm Jehanabad Jail,” Rediff News, November 14, 2005. ix Sudheer Pal Singh, “Illegal Mining May Impede Divestment in Coal India,” Business Standard, August 21, 2010. x Government of India, “Loss of Coal Production in Naxalite Areas,” Press Information Bureau, August 4, 2010, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=64116 (accessed January 4, 2011). xi “Chronology of Naxal Attacks on Trains,” India Today, May 28, 2010. xii Law Kumar Mishra, “Maoists Blow Up Track on Gaya-Dhanbad Section, Rail Traffic Disrupted,” Times of India, September 13, 2010. xiii “Naxal Attacks Doubled in 2009, Rlys Lost Rs 500cr: Mamata,” Times of India, April 23, 2010. xiv Manoj Prasad, “Naxal Attacks, Escalated Cost Derail Jharkhand Railway Projects,” India Express, April 12, 2010. xv Ishita Ayan Dutt, “Naxal Hits to Pull NMDC Net Down by Rs 1,000 cr,” Business Standard, April 20, 2010. xvi “NMDC to Lay 12 mt Pipeline on Highways to Avoid Naxal Attacks,” The Financial Express, July 20, 2010. xvii “Naxals Obstruct Road Works,” The Hindu, May 9, 2011. xviii Dutt. xix Sandeep Joshi, “550 More Mobile Towers to Boost Fight Against Naxalites,” The Hindu, June 30, 2010. xx “World Bank Approves $1.5 billion for India’s Rural Roads Scheme,” Press Trust of India, December 22, 2010. xxi Prassana Mohanty, “Maoists’ Financing – The Blood Flows as Long as the Cash Flows,” Governance Now, April 7, 2010. xxii Mohanty xxiii Sujeet Kumar, “Maoists extort Rs 300 Crore Annually in Chhattisgarh,” The Economic Times, July 5, 2009. xxiv Bharti Jain, “Rs 150 Crore: Maoists Extortion Amount From Chhattisgarh SSIs,” The EconomicTimes, April 10, 2010. xxv Ajit Kumar Singh and Sachin Bansidhar Diwan, “Red Money,” Outlook India, April 5, 2010. xxvi Ministry of Home Affairs, 2010-2011 Annual Report (Delhi: Government of India, 2011). xxvii Shaikh Azizur Rahman, “India’s Illegal Coal Mines Turn Into Death Pits,” The WashingtonTimes, November 24, 2006. xxviii Prasoon Majumdar, “Our Own Banana Republics!” Indian Institute of Planning andManagement, August 26, 2010, http://prasoonmajumdar.blogspot.com/2010/08/our-own-banana- republics.html (accessed April 29, 2011). xxix United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, “India is a Major Drug Hub: US,” September, 2007, http://www.unodc.org/india/en/rajiv\\_quoted\\_et.html (accessed February 25, 2011).

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

    "full_text": "# India's Geographic Vulnerability to Climate Change Industry Updates 17 mins September 25, 2024 Manasvi Patel ## **World Environmental Health Day 2024** World Environmental Health Day 2024 focuses on the theme \"Environmental Health: Creating Resilient Communities through Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation.\" This theme underscores the critical need to enhance community resilience in the face of climate-related disasters, which have become increasingly frequent and severe due to global warming. By emphasizing disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation, this year's theme calls for integrated approaches that not only protect public health but also ensure sustainable development. India's unique geography and climate make it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. With 27 out of 29 states and 7 union territories susceptible to natural hazards like floods, cyclones, droughts, and earthquakes, the country faces an uphill battle against the devastating impacts of climate change. As World Environmental Health Day 2024 approaches, it's crucial for India to take bold steps to enhance community resilience and protect its vulnerable populations. ### Geographical Factors Contributing to Disaster Risk India's geographical factors significantly contribute to its disaster risk profile, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The combination of its diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors creates a complex landscape of [vulnerabilities](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf): - [**Earthquakes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.7059oimyb6r3): Approximately 58.6% of India's landmass is susceptible to earthquakes, with the country situated in a seismically active zone due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. - [**Coastal Vulnerability**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.sipw79xc52s): India's coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, exposes it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. - [**Floods**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.af8gn4f1799i) and [**droughts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.xdkivgfc02df): about 40 million hectares (around 12% of the land) are prone to floods and river erosion, while 68% of cultivable land is vulnerable to droughts. - [**Landslides**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.kmor8crhvnf7) and avalanches: The hilly regions are also at risk from landslides and avalanches, further compounding the disaster risk faced by various communities across the nation. #### Seismic Activity India is situated at the convergence of several tectonic plates, making it prime for earthquakes. ~58% of the country’s landmass is classified as being at risk for earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity. This seismic vulnerability is particularly pronounced in regions such as the Himalayan belt, which experiences tremors due to ongoing tectonic activity. ##### The Gujarat (Bhuj) Earthquake (2001) For instance, the [2001 Bhuj earthquake](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bhuj-earthquake-of-2001), which registered a magnitude of 7.7, resulted in over 20,000 deaths and injured more than 150,000 others. The earthquake affected approximately 28 million people, destroyed more than 400,000 buildings, with the telecom building collapsing, Bhuj was isolated from the rest of the state; the most seriously affected was the Kandla port (the busiest port in India) which caters to handling crucial imports of petroleum products, crude oil and chemicals and export of agricultural commodities, with about five of the 10 jetties damaged. Over 10,000 small and medium industrial units had to stop production due to damage to plants, factories, and machinery. The Indian State Department [estimates](https://www.adrc.asia/publications/recovery_reports/Gujarat.pdf) that the earthquake affected, directly or indirectly, 15.9 million people out of 37.8 million. The government estimated the direct economic loss at $1.3 billion, while estimates indicate this could be as high as $5 billion. Following the earthquake, emergency relief operations were launched by both government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs): - [ActionAid India](https://www.actionaidindia.org/emergency/gujarat-earthquake-2001/) mobilized local community-based organizations to provide immediate assistance in the most affected areas, by establishing temporary shelters, distributed food and medical supplies, and set up psycho-social counseling services for survivors. - The government initiated a [comprehensive rehabilitation plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm) that included new building codesto ensure that the structures were designed to be earthquake-resistant; and infrastructure redevelopment of roads, schools, hospitals, and utilities was prioritized. - Emphasizing on community participation in planning and implementing disaster management strategies, village-level committees were formed to enhance local capacity for disaster response. - A [State Disaster Management Plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm#:~:text=Gujarat%20State%20Disaster%20Management%20Authority%20(GSDMA)%2C%20which%20would%20implement%20the%20reconstruction%20and%20rehabilitation%2C%20with%20support%20from%20various%20other%20agencies%20in%20the%20quake%2Dhit%20area.) was created that integrated lessons learned from the earthquake, and focused on risk assessment, early warning systems, and community-based disaster management practices aimed at reducing vulnerability to future seismic events. The resilience-building activities undertaken after the Gujarat earthquake reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate relief with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. These efforts underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in seismically active regions like India #### Coastal Vulnerability India's long coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, makes it highly vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis, [exposing](https://irade.org/Sustainable%20and%20Disaster%20Resilient%20Urban%20DevelopmentFinal%20.pdf) it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. This vulnerability is particularly pronounced in states like Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, which have borne the brunt of devastating cyclones in recent years. ###### Cyclone Fani (2019) Cyclone Fani, which made landfall in Odisha on May 3, 2019, serves as a prime example of the destruction that coastal areas face. The [extremely severe](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/cyclone-fani-damage-loss-and-needs-assessment) cyclonic storm caused extensive damage across 14 districts in Odisha, [affecting](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2019-000041-ind) at least 10 million people in the North-eastern Sates of India. Despite the early evacuation of a million people, the cyclone has severely affected the lives and livelihoods of more than 28 million people across 3 States in India. [Total damage](https://ncds.nic.in/sites/default/files/OEDS3NCDS.pdf) to existing stock of assets has been estimated at over $2.4 billion, whereas the economic losses flowing from the disaster are estimated at nearly ~$1.1 billion. In response to the devastation caused by Cyclone Fani, several resilience-building activities were implemented to enhance disaster preparedness and recovery efforts: - [The Government of Odisha](https://www.unicef.org/media/82111/file/India-Cyclone-Fani-SitRep-12-May-2019.pdf) coordinated one of the largest emergency preparedness exercises, mobilizing over 45,000 volunteers and 100,000 officials to ensure effective communication and evacuation protocols. This effort enabled the successful evacuation of approximately 1.47 million people from low-lying areas before the cyclone made landfall. - The state government constructed hundreds of cyclone shelters along the coast to provide safe refuge during storms, which were stocked with essentials like food and water. - Local stakeholders, NGOs, and civil society organizations collaborated with the government to conduct training programs on disaster preparedness including educating communities about evacuation routes and safety measures The resilience-building activities undertaken after Cyclone Fani reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate response efforts with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. The lessons learned from this cyclone underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in coastal regions like Odisha. #### Flood-Prone Areas Over 40 million hectares (about 12% of India’s land) is [prone to floods and river erosion](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf). The monsoon season often brings heavy rainfall leading to river overflow and flash floods, particularly in states like Assam and Bihar. ##### Assam Floods (2023) Assam, a state in northeastern India, is characterized by its fertile Brahmaputra Valley, which supports a rich agricultural sector. The state’s agriculture is primarily based on rice, tea, and jute, and it benefits from the regular monsoon rains that sustain its crops. The geographical features of Assam, including its river basins and low-lying areas, contribute significantly to its susceptibility to flooding. In 2023, Assam experienced devastating floods that [impacted](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/india-whats-really-behind-assams-worsening-floods) over 2.5 million people. In response to the challenges posed by flooding, particularly following the severe floods in 2023, several resilience-building activities have been undertaken in Assam: - The Assam government allocated Rs 1200 crs in 2023-24 for the [construction and maintenance](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=Infrastructure%20Development%3A%20The%20Assam%20government%20has%20allocated%20Rs%201%2C200%20crore%20for%20the%20construction%20and%20maintenance%20of%20flood%20control%20infrastructure%2C%20including%20embankments%20and%20flood%20barriers%2C%20for%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20period.) of flood control infrastructure, including embarkments and drainage systems and investment aimed to enhance the state's capacity to manage floodwaters effectively and reduce the risk of future inundations. - The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) invested ₹25 crores in developing advanced flood forecasting and early warning systems. These systems provide alerts up to three days in advance, allowing communities to prepare for impending floods and evacuate if necessary. - The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) [covers](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=The%20Pradhan%20Mantri%20Fasal%20Bima%20Yojana%20(PMFBY)%20covers%20around%2056%25%20of%20the%20farmers%20in%20Assam%20as%20of%202023.%20This%20scheme%20provides%20insurance%20coverage%20against%20crop%20losses%20due%20to%20natural%20calamities.) around 56% of farmers in Assam as of 2023, providing insurance against crop losses due to natural calamities. This scheme is crucial for protecting farmers' livelihoods and ensuring financial support during disasters. - A Community-Based Disaster Management project was launched in 2023, aimed at building local capacity for flood management in 100 selected gram panchayats focusing on on empowering communities with knowledge and resources to respond effectively to floods. In 2023, Assam introduced a ' [green budget](https://www.open-contracting.org/2023/09/28/improving-climate-resilience-in-flood-prone-assam-india/)' committing approximately $2 billion towards climate change action and disaster risk reduction, aiming to enhance long-term resilience against climate-related disasters through sustainable development practices. The resilience-building activities implemented in Assam following recent floods reflect a proactive approach to disaster risk reduction. By investing in infrastructure, enhancing early warning systems, promoting community engagement, and introducing innovative financial mechanisms like insurance schemes and green budgets, Assam is working towards building a more resilient agricultural sector capable of withstanding the impacts of flooding. #### Drought and Water Scarcity Drought and water scarcity are significant challenges in India, with [about](https://nidm.gov.in/pdf/trgReports/2021/July/Report_29July2021sk.pdf) 68% of the country's cultivable area vulnerable to these conditions. ##### Rajasthan Drought and Water Scarcity Rajasthan, the largest state in India, faces significant challenges related to water scarcity and drought leading to crop failures and economic distress among farmers. The state has [limited water resources](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/ar/261801490687132806/pdf/113703-WP-Water-Assessment-and-Potential-for-Private-Sector-Interventions-PUBLIC.pdf), with only 1.16% of India's total water supply, making it particularly susceptible to prolonged drought conditions. It's among the most [vulnerable to droughts](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/29/surajpura-rajasthan-india-drought-villagers-farmers-climate#:~:text=ajasthan%2C%20India%E2%80%99s%20largest%20state%2C%20is%20among%20the%20most%20vulnerable%20to%20droughts%2C%20with%2098%25%20of%20its%20250%20village%20blocks%20in%20sectors%20marked%20as%20%E2%80%9Cdark%20zones%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20areas%20with%20dangerously%20low%20groundwater%20levels%20%E2%80%93%20and%20almost%207%25%20of%20the%20land%20uncultivable), with 98% of its 250 village blocks in sectors marked as “dark zones” – areas with dangerously low groundwater levels – and almost 7% of the land uncultivable. In response to the recurring drought conditions, several resilience-building activities have been implemented in Rajasthan: - Rainwater harvesting and water conservation techniques were introduced to mitigate the effects of droughts and were prioritized via traditional techniques such as Anictus, Bairis, and tanks. In 2023, after an [unusually high rainfall](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/climate-opportunity-how-did-rajasthan-harvest-rainwater-after-the-early-monsoon-of-2023--94579) of 588.9 mm (nearly 2X the normal amount) villagers utilized these methods to direct the water into ponds and storage system, providing drinking water [for upto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwXQurAJLKs) 1.5 years in some villages. - The Rajasthan Water Sector Restructuring Project, costing a total of $495 million, of which $345 million is [financed](https://www.ndb.int/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rajasthan-Water-00012.pdf) by the New Development Bank, aimed to rehabilitate the Indira Gandhi Canal System, covering over 990 km of canal systems, reclamation of more than 33,000 km of waterlogged areas, and implementation of micro-irrigation techniques. Government schemes like the [Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana](https://pmksy.gov.in/) (PMKSY) were implemented to focus on enhancing irrigation facilities, along with the introduction of a crop insurance scheme to protect farmers from losses due to drought. Despite these resilience-building efforts, Rajasthan continues to face the challenges posed by recurring droughts. The state's vulnerability is exacerbated by its arid climate, limited water resources, and high dependence on agriculture. Sustained efforts and investments in water management, and agricultural practices are crucial for mitigating the impact of droughts and ensuring food security in the region. #### Topography and Landslides India's diverse topography includes mountainous regions that are particularly vulnerable to landslides and avalanches, especially during the monsoon season. The Himalayan region, along with the Western Ghats, experiences heavy rainfall that can destabilize slopes and trigger landslides. One of the most devastating recent events occurred in Wayanad, Kerala, where a series of landslides on July 30, 2024, resulted in significant loss of life and property. ##### The Wayanad Landslides (2024) On July 30, 2024, Wayanad district in Kerala was struck by catastrophic landslides that resulted from extreme rainfall. [The region](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece) received 572 mm of rainfall within 48 hours leading up to the disaster, causing hillsides to collapse in the villages of Mundakkai and Chooralmala. This resulted in over 336 fatalities, ~397 were injured, and at least 118 missing. The debris flow altered the course of the Iruvanjipuzha River, exacerbating flooding conditions in surrounding areas. The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) [reported](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/86000-sq-metres-of-land-slipped-away-debris-travelled-8-km-along-iruvanjippuzha-river-isro-satellite-images-reveal/articleshow/112231968.cms?from=mdr) that about 86,000 square meters of land had shifted due to the landslide. In response to the Wanayd landslides, several activities were initiated: - A [rescue operation](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece#:~:text=On%20August%201%2C%20Chief%20Minister%20Pinarayi%20Vijayan%20said%20over%209%2C300%20people%20were%20staying%20in%2091%20relief%20camps%20in%20Wayanad%20district.) was mobilized involving the Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and local authorities, over 9,300 people were accommodated in relief camps across the district. - [Experts](https://india.mongabay.com/2024/08/commentary-on-the-trail-of-the-wayanad-landslide/) have called for implementing site-specific land-use policies and improving drainage management to mitigate future risks. Additionally, establishing local landslide early warning systems (LEWS) has been recommended to enhance community preparedness. The Wayanad landslides highlight the urgent need for improved land management practices and disaster preparedness in vulnerable regions of India. By implementing effective resilience-building strategies, including community engagement and infrastructure improvements, it is possible to mitigate the impacts of future landslides and protect lives and livelihoods. India's unique geographical factors significantly contribute to its vulnerability to natural disasters. The country's diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors create a complex landscape of risks, including earthquakes, coastal vulnerability, floods, droughts, landslides, and avalanches. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events due to global warming. To address these challenges, India must adopt a comprehensive approach that integrates disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into its development plans. Building resilient communities requires a multi-faceted strategy that includes strengthening early warning systems, investing in resilient infrastructure, promoting community engagement, and adopting sustainable practices.

    "full_text": "[Defense & Security](https://southasianvoices.org/sav_channels/defense-security) # India-Pakistan Cyber Skirmishes and the Challenge of Attribution Written by [Kashoon Leeza](https://southasianvoices.org/author/kashoon) October 7, 202513 min read **Editor’s Note:** _This essay is part of a series entitled “ [Cybersecurity Threats, Law, and Norms: Priorities for South Asia](https://southasianvoices.org/collection-cyber-south-asia/),” a collaboration between the Stimson Center [Cyber](https://www.stimson.org/program/cyber/) and [South Asia](https://www.stimson.org/program/south-asia/) programs._ The recent India-Pakistan crisis in May illustrated how cyber and artificial intelligence are being integrated into military combat in the subcontinent, a significant development for South Asia’s fragile strategic stability. Along with an exchange of drone strikes, conventional missile firings, and aerial dogfights, the skirmish continued in the information domain, with Pakistani media reporting that the country’s military cyber wing [disrupted](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546050/security-sources-reveal-details-of-pakistans-massive-cyberattack-against-india) a communications network in India, predominantly affecting power distribution lines and government websites. Meanwhile, hackers sympathetic to the Indian government [leaked](https://x.com/cyberforcex) compromised data from Pakistan’s taxation authority and [targeted](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/how-pro-india-hackers-defended-country-during-cross-border-cyberattacks-amid-op-sindoor/articleshow/121385229.cms) other digital infrastructure. The active incorporation of cyber operations in this recent crisis, at least as acknowledged in public media reporting on both sides, is a departure from the past. It also raises serious concerns about the challenge of attribution on the subcontinent. Assigning responsibility for cyber operations comes with political, legal, and technical challenges. For one, in hostile India-Pakistan ties, there is limited space to entertain an ill-substantiated or inaccurate attribution as it risks escalation or creates domestic pressure for retaliation. Also, public attribution may be limited by the lack of well-established national frameworks for doing so. Neither India nor Pakistan currently have an official public attribution policy, making it difficult to assess their evidentiary standards and the validity of their threat intelligence. Limited official documents on procedures for incident response and forensic capacity suggest caution with regard to the credibility of public attribution. Thirdly, in cyber geopolitics, public attribution is a strategic choice determined by decisionmakers on a case-by-case basis. Cyber operations work best when clandestine and thus attribution is often intentionally restricted to avoid exposing technical capability. This is likely why Pakistan and India have generally approached official public attribution for cyber operations with caution in the past. The deployment of cyber-attacks complementary to kinetic operations along with unverifiable and potentially premature public attribution could set a dangerous precedent for a strategic environment as hostile and fragile as South Asia. Thus, in the absence of credible attribution tools and mechanisms, Islamabad and New Delhi would have to firmly resolve to adhere to responsible state behavior in cyberspace by doing the following: 1) establishing a cyber hotline to ensure communication channels are open, 2) supporting the applicability of international law to cyberspace, and 3) committing to non-proliferation of intrusive cyber technologies to non-state Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups to conduct cyber operations on their behalf. [\\[1\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn1) More broadly for each, institutionalizing their attribution process would ensure transparency and reassurance. **India and Pakistan’s Cyber Doctrines** Even apart from its prominent role in the recent India-Pakistan crisis, cybersecurity has found a significant place in both countries’ national security postures in recent years. In 2019, then Indian Minister of State for Defence [confirmed](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-approves-setting-up-of-defence-cyber-agency/articleshow/72264836.cms) the development of a defense cyber agency to handle cyber threats in a military context as well as budgetary allocations for cyber operations. In 2021, India’s former National Security Advisor acknowledged New Delhi’s capability to conduct “ [cyber sabotage and cyber warfare _._](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/M.-K.-Narayanan-on-India-Pakistan-diplomacy-and-terrorism/article55940567.ece)” And in 2024, the Indian Ministry of Defence [announced](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-formulate-new-doctrine-for-cyberspace-operations/articleshow/111094158.cms) a joint doctrine for cyberspace operations, shifting away from the country’s previous policy of strategic ambiguity on the use of cyber in the warfare domain, and integrating both [defensive and offensive capabilities](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2153626). [\\[2\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn2) While Pakistan does not have a pronounced cyber doctrine, Islamabad’s national security posture reflects the necessity of integrating cyber capabilities with military operations. Inaugurating the Army’s Cyber Division in 2018, the then Chief of Army Staff articulated that “ [firepower and cyber have emerged as the mainstay of future war.”](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369646/firepower-cyber-have-emerged-as-mainstay-of-future-war-coas) Pakistan has also invested in cyber capacity, as the [2021 National Cybersecurity Policy](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) reiterates, to protect national critical infrastructure as well as government information systems. These policy documents underline that India and Pakistan recognize the importance of investing in cyber capability to uphold their national interests. The next section explores how each state potentially uses these capabilities for strategic gain. **Cyber Capability and Operations** Countries are increasingly employing state capabilities to conduct cyber operations to achieve strategic objectives such as intelligence gathering; Pakistan and India are no different. Over the past few years, each state is alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage. This is done either through state capability or threat actors backed by the state. Publicly available information suggests that [APT 36](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/apt-36)—also known as [Transparent Tribe](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/transparent-tribe-apt36-pakistan-aligned-threat-actor-expands-interest-in-indian-education-sector/) and [SideCopy](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/operation_c-major)—is a Pakistan-linked APT group, alleged to have conducted cyber [espionage](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) particularly in India and Afghanistan. Likewise, APT groups such as [Sidewinder](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0121/#%3A~%3Atext%3DSidewinder%20is%20a%20suspected%20Indian%2CChina%2C%20Nepal%2C%20and%20Afghanistan) and [Patchwork](https://medium.com/@Ab_Hussain/indian-apts-target-middle-east-1e4a11b3ce95) are thought to be Indian state-backed threat actors, conducting cyber operations in Pakistan and elsewhere. > “Over the past few years, \\[India and Pakistan are\\] alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage.” While there is limited information publicly available regarding the cyber operations conducted by each side, some sources do point to state acquiescence or support. A report by a Canadian firm [revealed](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/media/27613/ocr) that in 2021, the Indian government had allegedly conducted [cyber surveillance](https://www.dawn.com/news/1636767) on Pakistan’s [political leaders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/) using the Israeli [Pegasus software](https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-pegasus-spyware/). India-based hacking groups reportedly continued to [target](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) Pakistani government entities in the following years aiming to infiltrate systems and access computer controls. Similarly, media reports claimed that Pakistan-based hackers had [deployed](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) malware against Indian government and defense sectors, attempting to gain access to sensitive information. In 2019, the cyber-attack on India’s nuclear facility, the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, was thought by some [analysts](https://www.orfonline.org/research/decoding-motives-behind-the-kudankulam-intrusion-58083) to have been perpetrated by Pakistan, though there was no public attribution. The technical attribution by cybersecurity firms [pointed](https://www.vifindia.org/sites/default/files/cyber-attack-on-kudankulam-nuclear-power-plant.pdf) to a North Korean state-sponsored entity, the Lazarus Group. This complex picture of the potential use of proxies points to the challenge of attribution in an India-Pakistan context. **The Attribution Challenge** Attribution in cyberspace is the process of identifying and assigning responsibility to threat actors behind the cyber operation or malicious activity. However, attribution is rarely straightforward because, unlike physical crimes, cyber actors can hide behind the anonymity of the internet or impersonate other computers. Threat actors can also remain in the system undetected, silently stealing information through stolen passwords or impersonation. In terms of technical challenges, the sophistication of the operation depending on capability could also make it difficult to trace the crime back to an actor. For instance, during the India-Pakistan crisis in May, the Indian cyber agency, Maharashtra Cyber, reported a significant surge in cyber-attacks [originating](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-sindoor-and-india-pakistans-escalated-rivalry-cyberspace#:~:text=noted%20a%20surge%20in%20DDoS,in%20these%20cyberattacks%20as%20it) from Pakistan as well as countries like Indonesia, Morocco, and Bangladesh. Threat actors using the location of a third country is often a deliberate and popular tactic to confuse the perpetrator’s identity and origin, as an IP address is usually the first source of identification. A popular global example is the 2018 [Olympic Destroyer cyberattack in South Korea](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/olympic-destroyer/21494/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20the,uproar%20was%20no%20laughing%20matter.), when the [Russian threat actors](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/) used sophisticated tactics to conceal their identity, enabling the blame to be deflected to North Korea and China. Thus, even if one actor might visibly be responsible, there might be someone else behind the keyboard. Moreover, technical attribution requires advanced threat intelligence capability, without which attribution could be erroneous and enable “false flag” categorization. For example, recently, Russian state-linked cyber group Turla allegedly attempted to access data exfiltrated from Indian military networks. Threat intelligence by Microsoft and Lumen’s BlackLotus Labs indicate that Turla [compromised a network](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) of Pakistan-based group SideCopy to spy on the Indian network. This created a false impression, shifting the blame towards Pakistan. This reiterates that the use of sophisticated techniques in an operation and the lack of advanced capability for forensic analysis can potentially obscure a threat actor’s identity, making attribution a challenge. Even advanced nations struggle with having requisite forensic capacity, so relatively newer cyber entrants like India and Pakistan will have to invest more efforts in this space. The key legal challenge India and Pakistan face regarding attribution is the lack of a transparent, and credible attribution framework. Unlike some countries, India and Pakistan do not have a formal attribution policy, making it difficult for independent analysts to assess the validity of their institutional processes. In practice, the process involves a loose [network of agencies](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/mapping-indias-cybersecurity-administration-in-2025?lang=en) coordinating technical and intelligence findings, raising concerns about the lack of consistent and verifiable evidentiary standards. It was in highlighting some of these challenges that Pakistan’s 2023 [position](https://docs-library.unoda.org/Open-Ended_Working_Group_on_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_-_(2021)/UNODA.pdf) on applicability of international law in cyberspace emphasized cross-border coordination and cooperation globally to ensure substantiated attribution. A lack of consistent evidentiary standards complicates attribution and can leave such efforts open to criticism as being politically motivated, making it critical for India and Pakistan to address this lacuna. This leads to the political challenge of attribution. The United States and [Five Eyes](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/fv-cntry-mnstrl-en.aspx) allies often attribute cyber-attacks when they need to reinforce international pressure on political adversaries or justify policy shifts. New Delhi and Islamabad have approached attribution rather cautiously. Though there are multiple reasons for this, the obvious one is to avoid jumping the gun and pointing to an adversary, which may create a particularly dangerous scenario of escalation. **Redefining Crises and Stability in South Asia** Attribution uncertainty creates costs for stability in South Asia and risks escalation in a future India- Pakistan crisis. Both countries share a hostile past and a tense strategic environment, leaving limited space for misunderstanding and miscalculation. A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing, tarnishing trust on both sides and instilling doubt. Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression. Pakistan’s 2021 Cyber Security Policy explicitly mentions that a cyberattack on critical infrastructure would be regarded as an [act of aggression](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) and be met with an appropriate response. > “A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing \\[…\\] Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression.” Another predicament is the question of proportionate response to an offensive cyber intrusion conducted by a state or state-linked threat actors without clear attribution. This is a conundrum faced by states globally, not just India and Pakistan. Determining what is a proportionate response in cyberspace currently lies at the discretion of the state. Some countries have included the principle of proportionality in formal statements unpacking how they interpret international law as applying to their conduct in cyberspace. According to its 2023 statement, while Pakistan acknowledges proportionality as applying in the context of conflict and international humanitarian law, it does not otherwise present views on response. India has not yet published a national statement. Such norms and behavior are either unaddressed or awaiting legal applicability in international frameworks. For the complicated security environment of South Asia, integration of cyber capability without legal clarity is thus worrisome. In times of active conflict, cyber operations, including information and influence operations, can create a [fog of war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQvsb4ouuI0) for decisionmakers and undermine the process of crisis management. Persistent cyber intrusions could also further compromise trust and impact and possibly backtrack the confidence-building measures (CBMs) already in place between India and Pakistan. Given that nuclear CBMs between India and Pakistan are already tenuous, a potential cyber-attack or even a data breach could be misperceived as altering the balance of power. **Policy Recommendations** To ensure that cyber does not introduce yet another element of uncertainty and that the precarious balance of power is maintained on the subcontinent, policymakers in India and Pakistan should: **_Establish a cyber hotline:_** Cyber operations can perpetuate misperception and misunderstanding, especially with attribution challenges. Therefore, rapid communication during a cyber crisis is critical. Both countries could exchange doctrines, ensure technical cooperation, and maintain a directory in case of crisis. Cyber CBMs, including hotlines and dedicated focal points for exchange, can also potentially enhance a sense of predictability. **_Support the applicability of international law to cyberspace:_** While there is consensus across the board that international law applies to cyberspace, states are still discussing how core legal principles and existing commitments, such as the non-use of force, proportionality, sovereignty, and due diligence, apply to cyberspace. Islamabad and New Delhi are advised to actively adhere to international and bilateral negotiations, such as the UN’s recently launched Global Mechanism on ICTs, successor to the Open-ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies. Pakistan published its national position paper in 2023 outlining the applicability of international law. India could follow suit, to maintain accountability and transparency. **_Commit to restraining proliferation of offensive intrusion capabilities:_** To dodge attribution and accountability, states often employ non-state APT groups to influence cyber operations. This results in proliferation of sophisticated intrusive cyber technologies and capabilities to non-state threat actors, not bound by rules and norms of state responsibility. Cyber operations through non-state APT actors help maintain plausible deniability. India and Pakistan should refrain from transferring capabilities to non-state APT groups to ensure responsible state behavior and maintain stability. **_Institutionalize attribution:_** To ensure responsible state behavior, both India and Pakistan should consider improving their attribution process. Institutionalizing the process and detailing their evidentiary standards to substantiate the findings will build confidence in their intelligence and threat assessments. Publishing a national attribution policy would explain the objectives behind disclosing a breach or attack, beyond merely aiming for political scoring. Further, both states could also benefit from investing in legal and technical capacity-building for attribution, including in collaboration with private entities and multilateral partnerships. As their decades-long hostilities spill over into cyberspace, there is likely a higher probability of cyber operations increasing in an India-Pakistan context. Realizing the serious implications of cyber threats to strategic stability, Pakistan and India are advised to seriously engage in the measures above that would reduce misperception, increase accountability and transparency, and indicate their commitments to the norms and practices of international law and responsible state behavior during conflict and peace time. _Views expressed are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the positions of South Asian Voices, the Stimson Center, or our supporters._ Also Read: [Cyber Quicksand?

Defensive capabilities, as the name suggests, are used for building resilience. The aim is to build capacity to protect and respond, minimizing risks and mitigating cyber threats. Offensive capabilities are used to deny, disrupt, and degrade or destroy the adversary’s systems or networks for military or strategic purposes. However, the nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to neatly distinguish between offensive and defensive actions; some activities, like those carried out by security researchers for the purpose of testing for vulnerabilities, could be viewed as an offensive action. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Image 1: [blickpixel via Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/circuit-board-computer-chip-564814/) Image 2: [Great Norwegian Encyclopedia](https://snl.no/Kjernekraft_i_India) Posted in: [Crisis](https://southasianvoices.org/category/crisis/), [Cybersecurity](https://southasianvoices.org/category/cybersecurity/), [Escalation Control](https://southasianvoices.org/category/escalation-control/), [India](https://southasianvoices.org/category/india/), [India-Pakistan Relations](https://southasianvoices.org/category/india-pakistan-relations/), [Pakistan](https://southasianvoices.org/category/pakistan/), [Technology](https://southasianvoices.org/category/technology/) Share this: ## Subscribe to our newsletter Stay informed about the subcontinent.

Further, the report describes the significance of interconnectors during geopolitical instability and war, using examples from Ukraine, Moldova and the Baltic States. Recommendations are provided on both deploying new interconnection capacity, and securing the existing infrastructure. ## Interconnectors keep power flowing through disruptions #### **Without interconnectors, Europe could have experienced two additional major blackouts in the last five years, and the Iberian one could have been much more severe.** Countries like Ukraine, Moldova, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, would’ve been fully exposed to Russia’s energy blackmail, with dire political and social consequences. Playing a key role in the stability of the European continent, existing interconnectors need to be secured from sabotage, and new projects need to be planned and deployed, especially in regions with the highest risk of technical or political incidents, such as the Iberian Peninsula and Eastern Europe. - **Three blackouts** in the EUwere avoided or managed thanks to European interconnectors in the last 5 years. - **Ukraine and Moldova** would’ve faced severe power loss due to Russia’s aggression, if not for cross-border electricity exchange with EU neighbours. - **55% of Europe’s power system has limited electricity import options,** increasing the risk of blackouts. Spain, Ireland and Finland are particularly exposed, with very little support available from neighbours in case of grid incidents. - **Nine recent cases of Baltic Sea infrastructure sabotage** show the need to protect Europe’s interconnection infrastructure. Europe’s energy infrastructure is under attack, with Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign escalating every day. Interconnectors form the backbone of energy security, safeguarding Europe against grid failures and geopolitical threats. The more interconnectors we have, and the better we secure our existing infrastructure, the safer we are in the face of sabotage. The expansion and security of European grids needs to be treated not as an energy priority, but as a vital element of protecting European society against attacks. **Dr Pawel Czyzak‍** Europe Programme Director, Ember Grid security is rudimentary to reducing Europe’s dependence on adversarial actors who have long used energy as a tool of economic coercion, dictating growth and productivity, and undermining stability across the continent. The much-needed push for low-carbon, domestic energy production must be matched by investment in grid modernisation to sustain large-scale electrification, strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy, and power its modern economy. **Isabelle Dupraz‍** Deputy Director, European Initiative for Energy Security ## **Interconnectors help stabilise or restart grids after faults** #### **Several examples show how interconnectors helped stabilise grids during incidents that could have otherwise had much more severe consequences.** ### European interconnectors made recent grid stress events less severe While European power systems maintain excellent reliability standards, multiple events in the past have put grids to a test. In those moments, interconnectors played a key role in stabilising the power systems and preventing widespread power cuts, or restarting the system if a blackout did occur. **Prevention: interconnectors helped avoid two potential blackouts in Poland** On 17th May 2021, a human error led to the malfunction of a high-voltage substation in Poland – Rogowiec. The substation feeds power from the largest power plant in the country – Bełchatów, into the Polish grid. The incident suddenly disconnected around 3.5 GW of capacity from the system and led to a [158 mHz](https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/news/2022/220318_Final_report_Rogowiec_incident.pdf) frequency drop, just shy of the [200 mHz buffer](https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/news/2019/190522_SOC_TOP_11.6_Task%20Force%20Significant%20Frequency%20Deviations_External%20Report.pdf) that would put the system in an emergency state. The Continental Europe Synchronous Area absorbed the frequency deviation by ramping up flows from neighbouring countries. These flows instantly reached [4.5 GW](https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/news/2022/220318_Final_report_Rogowiec_incident.pdf) – 2.3 GW more than allowed. Significant load appeared on power lines in Western Poland – 5 lines were operating at above 100% capacity, two of them above 120%, posing a risk of overloading. These violations were resolved by the Polish and German transmission system operators (TSOs), who limited flows and restored the frequency to nominal value within 30 minutes. Immediately after the incident, the Polish TSO requested emergency support from neighbouring countries to rebuild capacity reserves. Interconnectors were initially essential to prevent further frequency drops, the tripping of generators and cascading failures. Then they became key to rebuilding the system’s reserves while the grid malfunction was being removed. Another stressful event happened in Poland on 22nd June 2020, when heavy rainfall damaged coal supply lines. This, along with several other random failures, led to a record unplanned generation loss of [5.7 GW](https://bip.mos.gov.pl/fileadmin/user_upload/bip/Energetyka/Sprawozdania_z_wynikow_monitorowania_bezpieczenstwa_dostaw_energii_elektrycznej/Sprawozdanie_MKiS_z_monitorowania_bezpieczenstwa_dostaw_energii_elektrycznej_za_okres_2019-2020_tekst_ostateczny.pdf), equivalent to a quarter of that day’s peak demand. The event wasn’t as sudden as the one in 2021, and the frequency was not disrupted, so the incident didn’t require a formal investigation. However, the Polish TSO had to request emergency imports from neighbouring countries and deployed almost all coal plants available in “cold reserve” – plants used only in emergency situations. If interconnectors hadn’t provided [3 GW](https://www.next-kraftwerke.com/energy-blog/fossil-energy-poland) of power, a blackout would have been a real possibility. Only around [2 GW of coal and pumped-storage](https://wysokienapiecie.pl/30318-zalalo-elektrownie-prad-po-1300-zl-mwh/) capacity was left in the system, meaning 1 GW of demand could not have been balanced, leading to voluntary or forced reductions. **Stability: interconnectors filled France’s generation gap throughout 2022** France has recently faced major generation gaps due to nuclear plant outages. Historically, the country was the biggest exporter of electricity in Europe. However, in 2022, the total electricity generation dropped from 550 TWh in 2021 to 468 TWh – a decrease of 15%. Flows switched from [net exports of 42 TWh in 2021 to net imports of 17 TWh](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/european-electricity-review-2023/the-big-picture/#insight-1-the-fallacy-of-europes-return-to-coal). Peak imports reached 11 GW – 75% of the total interconnector capacity. In certain moments, imports covered up to 17% of the country’s peak electricity demand. While French nuclear has rebounded since 2022, the fleet still experiences outages, especially during [heatwaves](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/heat-and-power-impacts-of-the-2025-heatwave-in-europe/). In those moments interconnectors continue filling the capacity gaps, reducing price spikes as well. **Recovery: interconnectors restarted the Iberian grid after the blackout** On 28th April 2025, Spain and Portugal were hit by the largest blackout in Europe’s modern history, leaving around 60 million people without electricity for hours. [Multiple causes](https://www.compasslexecon.com/insights/publications/analysis-of-events-leading-to-the-peninsular-blackout-of-april-28th) led to the incident, and a final report by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) is due in October 2025. What is already certain is that, after the blackout, interconnectors were essential in restarting the Iberian power system. Just 10 minutes after the blackout, the first [France-Spain power line](https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/blackout/28-april-2025-iberian-blackout/) was reenergised, soon joined by the interconnector with Morocco and other connections with France. With the help of hydro and gas units, a full restoration was achieved in Spain around 4 AM on 29th April, around 16 hours after the incident. The Iberian Peninsula is more vulnerable to blackout risks than other European countries due to limited connections to the continental grid. Following the blackout, Spain and Portugal urged the EU to [back new interconnector projects](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/spain-portugal-ask-eu-push-power-links-with-france-after-outage-2025-05-21/), citing stronger links as essential to preventing future disruptions. The 2021 blackout in Texas offers a stark warning of what can happen if connectivity isn’t sufficient. In February 2021, severe cold weather left more than 4.5 million people without power for several days, causing [250 deaths](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/02/texas-winter-storm-final-death-toll-246/). With peak demand above 70 GW but just 1 GW of interconnection, the state was unable to stabilise frequency deviations or replace the [34 GW](https://www.ferc.gov/media/february-2021-cold-weather-outages-texas-and-south-central-united-states-ferc-nerc-and) of missing capacity through imports, leading to a quick collapse. Restarting the system after the blackout was difficult as well – with fossil gas generators rendered unavailable, interconnectors could not be used to resynchronise the system, as was the case after the Iberian blackout. This is why exploring additional interconnection was one of the recommendations of the [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission](https://www.ferc.gov/media/february-2021-cold-weather-outages-texas-and-south-central-united-states-ferc-nerc-and) that analysed the blackout. ### Up to 55% of Europe’s power system has limited electricity import options, increasing the risk of blackouts The more cross-border capacity a country has, the more stability can be provided by neighbours during grid stress events. This can be measured by the ratio of interconnector capacity (in the import direction) and a country’s peak electricity demand. This ratio varies from 12% in Poland, to almost 200% in Latvia – a country that has relatively small domestic demand, but supports electricity transits between Central Europe, the Baltics and the Nordics. However, there is no guarantee that imports from neighbours will be available instantly and at full capacity. That is why diversification is key: the more neighbours a country is connected to, the higher the chance that cross-border support can be provided on short notice. Summing the peak electricity demand of countries with three or fewer import directions and an import potential ratio of 25% or lower, up to 55% of Europe’s power system can be considered at risk due to limited emergency import options. Three countries – Spain, Ireland and Finland – are particularly exposed, with very little support available from neighbours in case of grid incidents. ## Interconnectors provide security in times of uncertainty and war #### **Being essential for Europe during Russia’s aggression, interconnectors have also become targets of sabotage.** ### Interconnectors helped when power systems were attacked Interconnectors have a key role in stabilising power systems after a fault. But the past three years have also highlighted their other security feature – delivering stable electricity even during war. **Keeping the grid alive during Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure** Before 2022, Ukraine’s power system was connected to the Russian and Belarusian ones. On the day of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine requested an emergency synchronisation with the European power system. This was achieved in a record time of just [3 weeks](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/2-years-ukraine-and-moldova-synchronised-electricity-grids-eu-2024-03-15_en). This proved to be a critical security move since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine included [multiple attacks](https://dixigroup.org/en/over-two-years-russia-has-carried-out-25-massive-attacks-on-ukraines-energy-sector/) on energy infrastructure. By May 2024, about [70% of Ukraine’s thermal generation capacity was either occupied or damaged](https://www.iea.org/reports/ukraines-energy-security-and-the-coming-winter/ukraines-energy-system-under-attack), compromising the country’s ability to meet domestic demand. Fortunately, up to [2.4 GW](https://ember-energy.org/data/europe-electricity-interconnection-data-tool/) of import capacity was available for Ukraine – equivalent to 20% of the peak demand – including emergency response schemes by neighbouring grid operators. Thanks to interconnectors, during the [most severe attacks](https://map.ua-energy.org/en/datasets/12f3148d-841a-478d-b9ed-72bf0764b286) on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in 2024, Ukraine imported over 800 GWh of electricity a month, though a capacity gap still remained, leading to [local power cuts](https://www.iea.org/reports/ukraines-energy-security-and-the-coming-winter/ukraines-energy-system-under-attack). Imports totalled 4 TWh in 2024, a striking shift from Ukraine’s historical role as an exporter of around 2 TWh of electricity a year in pre-war 2020 and 2021. **Stabilising Moldova ahead of parliamentary elections** Similarly to Ukraine, Moldova’s power system used to be synchronised with Russia and Belarus. In 2022 it also went through an emergency synchronisation process, using interconnectors with Romania – which again proved to be an effective security move. On 31st December 2024, Russia stopped supplying gas to Moldova’s largest power plant, in an effort to destabilise the country ahead of parliamentary elections. Moldova was forced to source up to [62%](https://adevarul.ro/stiri-externe/republica-moldova/criza-energetica-in-rep-moldova-o-mare-parte-2412020.html) of electricity demand from Romania. Fortunately, thanks to grid investments, Moldova’s energy security will soon be strengthened. A new interconnection, [Vulcanesti – Chisinau](https://ipn.md/en/the-vulcanesti-chisinau-highway-will-be-completed-by-the-end-of-the-year-says-the-minister/), is due to be deployed by the end of 2025, providing up to 80-90% of Moldova’s peak demand in emergency situations and ensuring independence from Russia. [Two other interconnectors](https://old.gov.md/en/content/construction-balti-suceava-power-linemodernization-balti-power-station-declared-national) are being constructed, Balti-Suceava, due in 2027, and Straseni-Gutinas, due in 2030, allowing for the full integration of Moldova with the European power grid. **Shielding Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia from Russia’s energy blackmail** Once reliant on Russia’s power grid, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were [fully synchronised](https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2025/02/09/entso-e-confirms-successful-synchronization-of-the-continental-european-electricity-system-with-the-systems-of-the-baltic-countries/) with Europe’s grid and decoupled from Russia on 9th February 2025. The [Baltic Synchronisation](https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/cef-energy-instrumental-funding-achieve-baltic-synchronisation-continental-european-network_en) was one of the EU’s biggest grid projects, receiving 1.2 billion EUR of support from the Connecting Europe Facility. The decoupling of Baltic States from Russia was made possible thanks to [new cross-border connections](https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/timeline-phases_en) between Poland and Lithuania ( [LitPol Link](https://tyndp-data.netlify.app/tyndp2018/projects/projects/123)), and between Estonia and Latvia, as well as existing connections between Estonia and Finland ( [EstLink and EstLink 2](https://www.nib.int/articles/estlink-2-to-tie-baltic-power-producers-closer-to-the-nordic-markets)), and Lithuania and Sweden ( [NordBalt](https://www.nkt.com/references/nordbalt-the-baltic-sea)). To further strengthen the energy security of the Baltics, a new interconnector between Lithuania and Poland is being planned: [HarmonyLink](https://www.pse.pl/web/pse-eng/-/pse-and-litgrid-signed-cooperation-agreement-to-build-harmony-link-interconnector-as-overland-line), due in 2030. ### Infrastructure sabotage is now a key threat Because interconnections play a key role in Europe’s security, they’ve recently come under attack. Since 2022, [nine incidents](https://gbv.wilsoncenter.org/article/mapping-undersea-infrastructure-attacks-baltic-sea) of infrastructure damage have been recorded in the Baltic Sea. These include five cases of communication cable disruption, and damage done to the Nord Stream and Balticconnector gas pipelines and the EstLink 2 power cable. The damage done to the EstLink 2 interconnector by a [Russian shadow-fleet vessel](https://www.euronews.com/2025/08/11/finland-charges-officers-of-russia-linked-eagle-s-ship-that-damaged-undersea-cables) decreased Estonia’s electricity import capacity by 27% just two months before the full [decoupling of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from the Russian power grid](https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2025/02/09/entso-e-confirms-successful-synchronization-of-the-continental-european-electricity-system-with-the-systems-of-the-baltic-countries/). Baltic Sea energy infrastructure is not the only one at risk. In April 2025, Russian hackers disrupted the operations of a [Norwegian hydropower facility](https://www.politico.eu/article/russian-hackers-took-control-norwegian-dam-police-chief-says/). In September 2025, over the span of just two days, a train carrying liquified gas [exploded near Vilnius](https://www.reuters.com/world/gas-explosion-prompts-lithuania-evacuate-residents-near-vilnius-rail-station-2025-09-10/), high-voltage lines were disrupted in an [arson attack](https://tvpworld.com/88818837/suspected-arson-attack-triggers-berlin-blackout), causing a partial blackout in Berlin, [19 Russian drones breached Polish airspace](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/poland-downs-drones-its-airspace-becoming-first-nato-member-fire-during-war-2025-09-10/) and [Israel carried out attacks in Qatar](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crme74p9gn2o) – one of Europe’s key gas suppliers. Since the start of the war in 2022, Russia-attributed [hackers](https://www.knowbe4.com/hubfs/Europe-Energy-Report-UK-EN.pdf) have targeted energy companies all across Europe, and globally, the [frequency of cyberattacks on energy utilities has doubled since 2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/ai-and-energy-security), according to the International Energy Agency. Energy supply is critical not only for civilian life, but also for military response, and [energy infrastructure remains a major target](https://theopportunity.pl/en/publications/report-will-the-sea-help-the-baltic-sea-and-polands-energy-security/), as shown by examples from Ukraine and Russia’s [hybrid warfare](https://www.iiss.org/research-paper/2025/08/the-scale-of-russian--sabotage-operations--against-europes-critical--infrastructure/) campaign in Europe. In the context of the Baltic power system, the role of cross-border interconnectors goes far beyond standard grid functions — they form the backbone of regional energy sovereignty and systemic resilience. The Baltic is no longer just a geographic area – it is becoming the integrated power plant of Northern and Eastern Europe, built on mutual support and diversified energy sources. Protecting this infrastructure must therefore go beyond the energy sector itself — it should be treated as part of NATO’s collective defense and the EU’s security architecture. **Zuzanna Nowak‍** Executive Director, The Opportunity Institute for Foreign Affairs ## Europe’s interconnectors need boosting and securing #### **Interconnectors are key in guaranteeing grid resilience, energy security and, more broadly, Europe’s safety. To continue providing stability against grid failures or geopolitical threats, two sets of actions need to be taken: the expansion of interconnector capacity and better security of existing infrastructure.** The upcoming [European Grid Package](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14672-European-grid-package_en) presents a timely opportunity to strengthen political commitment around both areas. European interconnection capacity is expected to [almost double](https://ember-energy.org/data/europe-electricity-interconnection-data-tool/) between 2024 and 2040, or even triple if all currently planned projects were delivered on time. Priority should be given to areas with limited connectivity and high exposure to potential disruption – such as the Iberian Peninsula, Eastern Europe and Finland. However, strategic investments will only happen with strong political commitment and [cross-border collaboration](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/central-and-eastern-europe-from-coal-to-renewables/). Worryingly, Poland, the EU’s fifth largest electricity market, has almost no interconnection expansion projects planned, despite recent near-blackout incidents and a high risk of sabotage. Yet, the country could benefit from new projects in the region: the [Baltic Energy Hub](https://www.epsog.lt/uploads/documents/files/Lietuvos%20energetikos%20vizija/Lithuania%20Energy%20System%20Transformation%20to%202050%20(EPSO-G%20presentation).pdf) and an [Eastern European transmission highway](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/in-it-together-cee-power-system/) that would secure Eastern Europe from Russia, and also enable the full integration of Ukraine, Moldova and the Western Balkans with the European power system. Existing infrastructure needs to be secured as well. The European Commission recently proposed an [Action Plan on Cable Security](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/joint-communication-strengthen-security-and-resilience-submarine-cables) and a [Hybrid Toolbox](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/hybrid-threats/) addressing [hybrid warfare](https://www.iiss.org/research-paper/2025/08/the-scale-of-russian--sabotage-operations--against-europes-critical--infrastructure/). Denmark is researching [underwater drones](https://www.offshore-energy.biz/danish-project-to-develop-drone-for-protecting-critical-underwater-infrastructure/) that could capture and immobilise hostile underwater vehicles, NATO established a [Critical Undersea Infrastructure teams](https://www.nato.int/cps/in/natohq/news_228959.htm?selectedLocale=en) in the UK and Belgium, and already deployed at least [20 drone boats in the Baltic Sea](https://www.twz.com/news-features/drone-boats-being-rushed-to-help-prevent-baltic-seafloor-cable-sabotage). But these reactive measures must be coupled with [coordinated planning and permitting to accelerate grid investments](https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/briefs/war-footing-securing-critical-energy-infrastructure) – as more interconnections, lines and substations make the system more resilient if one of the elements is attacked. In the case of cross-border and offshore projects, this requires more [active steering by the European Commission](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/embers-four-key-asks-for-the-new-eu-energy-commissioner/), facilitating regional collaboration and mediating between governments and financing institutions such as EIB and EBRD. [Grid enhancing technologies](https://www.secureenergyeurope.org/eies-insights-securing-the-european-grid), including digital solutions, should be incentivised in EU funding, enhancing monitoring, maintenance and recovery of grid assets. [Supply chain security](https://www.secureenergyeurope.org/eies-insights-securing-the-european-grid) is essential as well, with a priority for “made in Europe” components and digital systems. Finally, in both grid expansion and protection, [collaboration and coordination is critical](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/64f5f132690bb40dc03cfaf4/t/67640a95696a37740af5fd03/1734609558137/EIES+Allied+Infrastructure+Security+Roundtable.pdf), given the group of stakeholders ranges from grid operators, through the EU, governments and financial institutions, to NATO and different branches of the military. ## Supporting materials ### **Downloads** Download the full analysis PDF.

Pakistani hackers attacked 1.5 million-plus Indian websites after Operation Sindoor: Failure rate, names of 7 Pakistani hacker groups; techniques used and more [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Oct 13, 2025, 14:23 IST Share AA + **Text Size** - Small - Medium - Large Following the Pahalgam terror strike, Maharashtra Cyber identified seven APT groups, primarily Pakistan-allied, responsible for over 1.5 million cyber attacks targeting critical Indian infrastructure. While only 150 attacks succeeded, these groups employed malware, DDoS attacks, and misinformation campaigns. The attacks originated from Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Middle East, and Indonesia, with some successful defacements and alleged data theft. Representational AI image Maharashtra Cyber has reportedly identified seven Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups responsible for launching over 15 lakh cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure websites across India following the Pahalgam terror strike. Of these, only 150 attacks were successful, officials said, as per a report by news agency PTI. This means a failure rate of 99.99% or should one say abysmal success rate of 0.01%.In a report titled \"Road of Sindoor\", prepared under the military operation launched by the Indian armed forces under the same name against terrorists, the state's nodal cyber agency has detailed the cyber warfare launched by Pakistan-allied hacking groups. The report has been submitted to all key law enforcement agencies, including the Director General of Police and the State Intelligence Department.According to the report, these cyber attacks originated from Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Middle East, and an Indonesian group, said Yashasvi Yadav, Additional Director General of Police, Maharashtra Cyber. ## India-Pakistan Ceasefire has not stopped Pakistani hackers Even after India and Pakistan reached an understanding to stop military hostilities, Indian government websites are facing a barrage of cyber attacks from the neighbouring country as well as from Bangladesh and the Middle Eastern region, they said.\"The probe discovered that cyber attacks on (government websites in) India decreased after India-Pakistan ceased hostilities, but not fully stopped. These attacks continue from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Morocco, and Middle Eastern countries,\" he said.Pakistani hackers bringing down websites of major airports in India, Election Commission and ...Addressing reporters, a senior official of Maharashtra Cyber debunked claims of hackers stealing data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai, hacking aviation and municipal systems, and targeting the Election Commission website. ## Techniques used by Pakistani hackers The methods used by hackers included malware campaigns, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and GPS spoofing. The defacement of Indian websites was also reported. He said many such attacks were thwarted, and critical infrastructure of India was saved.The report also highlights a hybrid warfare strategy by Pakistan-allied groups that includes widespread misinformation campaigns. These groups falsely claimed to have hacked India's banking system and caused power outages. These false narratives included claims of cyber attacks on India's power grid, statewide blackouts, satellite jamming, disruption of the Northern Command, and an alleged attack on a BrahMos missile storage facility, Yadav said.Maharashtra Cyber identified and removed over 5,000 instances of misinformation and fake news related to India-Pakistan military conflicts that were circulating on social media. ## 7 Pakistani Hacker groups that attacked Indian websites The seven hacking groups identified in the report are APT 36 (Pakistan-based), Pakistan Cyber Force, Team Insane PK, Mysterious Bangladesh, Indo Hacks Sec, Cyber Group HOAX 1337, and National Cyber Crew (Pakistan-allied). These groups collectively launched approximately 1.5 million targeted cyber attacks on Indian infrastructure, Yadav said. ## The Indian websites Pakistani hackers brought down Among the 150 successful attacks, the Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council website was defaced. The attackers also claimed to have stolen data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), as well as from telecom companies, with some of the data allegedly appearing on the darknet. Additionally, the website of the Defence Nursing College in Jalandhar was defaced. **About the Author** [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) The TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

By [Michael Fisher](https://www.itnews.asia/author/michael-fisher--1955979)on Oct 7, 2025 3:09PM The recent surge in cybersecurity incidents across the Asia Pacific region is now forcing a redefinition of what constitutes \"critical infrastructure.\" While energy grids, transport systems, and healthcare networks remain key targets, the latest attacks in aviation, retail, and financial services show that any network underpinning public safety, economic activity, or essential services can now be considered critical. In Australia, the Qantas breach exposed the personal information of over 5.7 million customers via a third-party system. In Singapore, nation-state actors like UNC3886 have been identified as actively targeting systems tied to national infrastructure. In India, ransomware has brought entire hospital systems and telecom providers to a standstill - disrupting care, communication, and public access. Even Google has now succumbed to a data breach. A growing concern is that this is not limited to large organisations. Cybercriminals are equally targeting small enterprises to gain access to larger corporate systems, as demonstrated by recent breaches of small to mid-size accounting and legal firms. These threats are also no longer confined to traditional IT environments, especially as digital and physical environments continue to converge. Operational Technology (OT) networks that are used to control machinery, industrial processes, and physical infrastructure are increasingly network-connected and vulnerable. Unlike IT systems, OT networks often lack built-in redundancy and can’t tolerate downtime, making them uniquely fragile in the face of modern cyber threats. > #### The increasing and high reliance on digital infrastructure across sectors like banking, retail, and logistics has elevated the criticality of their IT environments. A data centre failure or traffic outage can have the wide-ranging and same societal and economic impact as a disruption to water or energy supply. > > _- Michael Fisher, Regional Vice President, Asia Pacific and Japan, Garland Technology_ **The stakes are now higher than ever** As Singapore, India and Australia continue to digitalise core infrastructure and embrace smart systems, ensuring uninterrupted visibility across both IT and OT environments is emerging as a national priority for each country. Whether it’s a power grid in India, a port terminal in Singapore, or an airline in Australia, cyber resilience now depends on having the right architectural foundation – one that offers full visibility, supports zero-trust principles, and maintains uptime across the entire security stack. Governments and enterprises are realising the critical need for better network visibility, security and uptime that spans both digital and operational domains. This is because the next wave of attacks won't distinguish between IT and OT, so Asia Pacific organisations need to ensure their cyber defences are ready. **How can you bridge the IT–OT divide** Many organisations still depend on legacy security tools and operate without full packet visibility or the ability to monitor encrypted traffic. Even inline tools that are used to detect threats can create single points of failure if they’re not architected for continuous uptime. This vulnerability is amplified in OT, where patching or updates may require physical access to remote or sensitive facilities. A way around this lies in adopting highly resilient infrastructure that delivers real-time monitoring with zero disruption. This includes reliable network test access points (TAPs), network packet brokers, and hardware data diodes built for extreme operating conditions, along with inline bypass capabilities that ensure systems remain operational even when security tools fail or require maintenance. A good example of how this works in an organisational context is electrical utilities. As more electricity providers implement cybersecurity solutions inside substations, additional precautions must also be taken to protect infrastructure from sophisticated attacks. To address this, utilities need to look at: - Implementing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that passively monitors network traffic. - Ensuring that malicious code does not gain access to a substation’s network through the use of cost-effective hardware diodes and data diode TAPs. These provide an additional layer of security before connecting an IDS to a SPAN/Mirror port on a network. For example, a hardware data diode enforces unidirectional data flow so that information flows from sensitive environments, such as critical infrastructure, without the possibility of inbound threats. This one-way communication preserves the integrity of secure zones. There are situations where the use of SPAN/Mirror ports is still needed to connect the IDS to the substation’s network. In these instances, it is best practice to connect a hardware data diode between the SPAN/Mirror port and the IDS to pass the mirrored data onto the IDS sensor. This is because hardware data diodes eliminate bidirectional traffic flow, ensuring that no data is passed back into the Switch’s SPAN/Mirror port. In utilities and other key infrastructure, the use of inline bypass solutions is crucial in enabling organisations to update, test or maintain inline cybersecurity tools without taking them offline and risking exposure to potential cyberattacks. Inline bypass tools are also designed to ensure full network traffic visibility while minimising disruption during system updates and maintenance. With the line between what is and isn’t critical infrastructure continuing to blur, one thing is clear: future-readiness demands full-spectrum visibility, operational uptime, and the resilience to respond to the unexpected. The question that C-level executives of Asia Pacific organisations must now be prepared to answer confidently is whether their IT architecture is resilient enough to withstand a sophisticated cyberattack. _Michael Fisher is the Regional Vice President Asia Pacific and Japan, Garland Technology_ To reach the editorial team on your feedback, story ideas and pitches, contact them [here](mailto:editors@itnews.asia). © iTnews Asia Tags: [garland technology](https://www.itnews.asia/tag/garland-technology) [security](https://www.itnews.asia/security) ### Most Read Articles [**PhilHealth estimates 13 to 20 million members affected by data breach**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/philhealth-estimates-13-to-20-million-members-affected-by-data-breach-601471) [**IMDA and Enterprise Singapore launch SME-focused cybersecurity initiative**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/imda-and-enterprise-singapore-launch-sme-focused-cybersecurity-initiative-620891) [**Indonesia's national data centre suffers ransomware attack**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/indonesias-national-data-centre-suffers-ransomware-attack-609146) [**Ransomware gang Qilin claims attack on Japan’s Asahi breweries**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/ransomware-gang-qilin-claims-attack-on-japans-asahi-breweries-620895)",

According to **Swiss Re’s 2023 analysis, India suffered economic losses amounting to $12 billion (over ₹1 lakh crore) in 2023**, surpassing the 10-year average of $8 billion (2013-2022). Key disasters such as Cyclones Biparjoy and Michaung, as well as devastating floods, underscore the need for robust disaster management strategies. With floods alone accounting for 63% of total annual economic losses, there is a pressing need for improved preparedness, response mechanisms, and long-term mitigation measures. ###### **Admission Open for UPSC Prelims Revision Batch Starts from 13th January 2025 [: https://bit.ly/4jciwCi](http://%20https//bit.ly/4jciwCi)** * * * #### **Table of Contents** 1. **Introduction to Natural Disasters in India** 2. **Major Disasters and Their Impacts (2023)** 3. **Industrial and Urban Vulnerability** 4. **Disaster Management in India** 5. **Challenges in Disaster Management** 6. **Global Best Practices in Disaster Management** 7. **Steps Taken for Disaster Management in India** 8. **Way Forward** 9. **Conclusion** * * * ##### **Introduction to Natural Disasters in India** India’s geographical diversity makes it prone to a range of natural disasters, including cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and droughts.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it.

Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement.

Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

Due to its geographical location, seismic risk zone and intertropical convergence point, the Indian subcontinent also faces recurring atmospheric phenomena: heavy monsoon rains, floods, episodes of high heat, drought, etc. In addition, the high population density in risk areas further aggravates the situation. The number of human casualties continues to rise, from 1 674 deaths in 2015 to 2 045 in 2019. According to the report of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the total number of people who died between 2 000 and 2 019 is 79 732. During the same period, India had reported 321 catastrophic events. It is the third country in the world in terms of the number of [natural disasters](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/natural-disasters-in-2021), behind China and the United States. According to the same report, India has suffered nearly 80 billion USD in economic losses in 20 years. ## Breakdown of natural disasters in India per type of event and nature of losses | Natural disasters | Material loss | Human loss | | --- | --- | --- | | **Floods** | 52% | 63% | 32% | | **Hurricanes** | 30% | 19% | 32% | | **Landslides** | 10% | - | 2% | | **Earthquakes** | 5% | 10% | 33% | | **Droughts** | 3% | 5% | 1% | | Total | 100% | 100% | 100% | **Source :** World Bank Some of the most frequent disasters include : **Floods** After China, India is the second country hardest hit by floods with no less than 17 of such events annually, affecting 345 million Indians. This scourge has caused a significant number of casualties and major economic damage to infrastructure, property, livelihoods and crops. Heavy monsoon rains in the eastern part of the country often cause the Brahmaputra River to overflow, with disastrous consequences. According to the 2019 Global Climate Risk Index report, floods account for 52% of the total calamities affecting India, claiming 63% of the material damage and 32% of the human losses reported as natural disasters. On an annual average, 7.500.000 hectares are flooded, and 1.600 lives are lost. **Earthquakes** The probability of an earthquake is high in India, with nearly 60% of the territory being classified as a moderate to severe seismic risk zone. According to seismologists, the Himalayas, one of the regions most exposed to earthquakes, should one day suffer a mega-shock caused by the pressure accumulated in the subsoil of the Himalayan arc. The last earthquake to date occurred in 2015. With a magnitude of 7.8, the earthquake killed 9 000 people and injured more than 20 000 others. More than 600 000 homes were also destroyed by the tremor. **Cyclones** Located in the intertropical convergence zone, the Indian subcontinent is one of the regions most affected by cyclones. Its coastline stretching over more than 8 000 kilometers accounts for nearly 10% of the world's tropical cyclones, the majority of which emerge over the Bay of Bengal and strike the east coast of India. On average, six to eight depressions form each year, two or three of which turn into tropical cyclones. A major cyclone (category 3 or more) develops every two years. In May 2020, [Cyclone Amphan](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/cyclone-amphan-15-billion-usd-of-economic-losses-in-south-asia), devastated India and Bangladesh, killing 84 people and devastating the coastal areas of both countries. It was the most powerful cyclone to hit the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 cyclone that killed 10 000 people in Odisha State (northeast India). **Heat waves and droughts** Extreme temperatures and resulting weather conditions significantly affect the health of residents and the agricultural sector. With global warming, these episodes of intense heat, more than 50 degrees, are becoming increasingly frequent. According to Indian authorities, in the last four years the country has reported no less than 4 620 deaths caused by heat waves which generally occur between March and June. The last event of this kind occurred in June 2019, claiming the lives of 50 people in 24 hours. Over the past 20 years, India has also sustained the two most severe droughts in the world. They took place in 2002 and 2015 and affected 300 and 330 million Indians, respectively. Despite the affordability of coverage and the intensity and frequency of natural events, the penetration rate of natural catastrophe insurance in India is almost nil, with less than 1% of the population contracting an insurance policy for this type of risk. For several years, the authorities have been planning to set up a national pool dedicated to natural disasters, a structure struggling to see the light of day. ## List of major natural disasters that have occurred over the last 20 years in India | Date | Place | Nature of the event | Economic losses | Insured losses | Number of fatalities | Number of affected persons | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | (in billion USD) | | **May 2020** | West Bengal | Hurricane Amphan | 13.5 | ND | 103 | 500 000 homeless | | **August 2018** | Kerala | Floods | 3.52 | 0.37 | 504 | 223 139 homeless | | **November 2015** | Chennai (Tamil Nadu) | Floods | 2.37 | 0.98 | 289 | -

Credit: FOTOGRIN - shutterstock.com A Chinese state-sponsored hacker group called RedNovember has conducted a global espionage campaign targeting critical infrastructure between June 2024 and July 2025, compromising defense contractors, government agencies, and major corporations while exploiting vulnerabilities faster than organizations could deploy security patches. The attacks included breaches of at least two US defense contractors and more than 30 Panamanian government agencies as part of a systematic targeting across the US, Europe, Asia, and South America, according to cybersecurity firm [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/rednovember-targets-government-defense-and-technology-organizations). The threat group deployed the Go-based Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike, and SparkRAT to maintain persistent network access after exploiting flaws in enterprise appliances, researchers said in the report. “The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms,” the report added. Recorded Future’s Insikt Group had previously tracked the activity under the designation TAG-100 before attributing it to Chinese state-sponsored operations. Microsoft also tracks overlapping activity from this group as Storm-2077. ## Systematic exploitation of enterprise network devices RedNovember systematically targeted internet-facing appliances that form the backbone of enterprise network security, successfully compromising SonicWall VPN devices, Ivanti Connect Secure appliances, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, F5 BIG-IP systems, Sophos SSL VPN products, and Fortinet FortiGate firewalls, researchers found. The hackers exploited both recently disclosed vulnerabilities and older flaws that organizations had failed to patch. RedNovember compromised two US defense contractors in April 2025 using CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti appliances – flaws for which patches had been available since January 2024, the report said. A European engine manufacturer that produces aerospace components was breached through its SonicWall VPN device, while multiple law firms fell victim through compromised network appliances, researchers documented. ## 72-hour vulnerability exploitation window RedNovember demonstrated the ability to weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities faster than most organizations could deploy patches, researchers found. When researchers published proof-of-concept code for Check Point VPN vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 on [May 30, 2024](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/), RedNovember was attacking vulnerable systems by June 3. That campaign hit at least 60 organizations across Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the United States within four days, according to the report. Similar patterns emerged with Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, with RedNovember consistently exploiting disclosed vulnerabilities within 72 hours of public exploit code availability, the research showed. ## Open-source tools masked attribution Rather than developing custom malware, RedNovember relied heavily on publicly available tools, including the Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework, and SparkRAT remote access tool, all written in the Go programming language, researchers found. The hackers used variants of the LESLIELOADER tool to deploy SparkRAT on compromised systems, with samples first detected in March 2024, according to the analysis. RedNovember also leveraged legitimate services, including vulnerability scanning tools like PortSwigger’s Burp Suite and VPN services, including ExpressVPN and Cloudflare’s Warp, to manage their infrastructure. “RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution,” researchers explained in the report. ## Global targeting across multiple sectors The group heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, while also conducting surveillance of government agencies across Panama, and targeting entities in Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, the report said. The hackers maintained persistent access to compromised networks for months, with some intrusions lasting from July 2024 through March 2025, according to the research. A Taiwanese IT company remained compromised throughout this period, with researchers tracking communications to Pantegana command-and-control servers. The hacker group also targeted organizations handling sensitive business negotiations, successfully compromising an American law firm involved in debt restructuring for a Chinese company and attempting to breach a major US newspaper, the report found. ## Coordinated timing with geopolitical events Several RedNovember campaigns coincided with significant geopolitical developments, researchers observed. The systematic surveillance of more than 30 Panamanian government agencies occurred just weeks after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an expanded partnership to counter Chinese influence in the canal zone. The targeting of Taiwan facilities, which house both military installations and semiconductor research operations, coincided with Chinese military exercises involving 90 warships around the island in December 2024, the report noted. “The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China,” the researchers wrote. The systematic targeting of internet-facing appliances across multiple vendor platforms indicated that organizations need enhanced monitoring and rapid patch deployment capabilities for network infrastructure devices, the report suggested. RedNovember “will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release,” researchers added in the report.

    "full_text": "STR/AFP/Getty Images Summary Naxalite rebels reportedly killed between 70 and 80 national and local Indian police personnel in a well-executed ambush April 6 in the eastern Indian state of Chhattisgarh. Naxalite ambushes targeting Indian police are common, especially in eastern India, but the April 6 attack was unusually large. This attack followed classic guerrilla ambush tactics that gave the assailants an overwhelming advantage over their targets. India's Naxalite rebels used classic guerrilla tactics in an ambush targeting Indian police April 6 (with STRATFOR map)....",

These states also face heightened risks: - **Gujarat:** Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. - **Maharashtra:** Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. - **Tamil Nadu:** Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. ## **Earthquake Risks** - Urban centres like **Delhi** and **Ahmedabad** face significant earthquake hazards. - A major earthquake in the **Himalayas** or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** in Gujarat. ## **Challenges in Resilience and Insurance** - Despite the scale of economic losses, **underinsurance** remains a critical issue: - **Protection Gaps:** Over **90%** of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. - **Costliest Flood Events:** - **Mumbai floods (2005):** Losses of **$5.3 billion** (2024 prices) - **Chennai floods (2015):** Losses of **$6.6 billion** (2024 prices) ## **Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach** - Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: - **Hotspot Identification:** - Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. - Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. - **Risk Assessment:** - Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. - Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. - **Reinsurance Solutions:** - Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. - Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. ## **Conclusion** - India's rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. - The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. - By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. * * * ### **Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods?** Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. ### **Q2. When was NDMA constituted?** In December 2005, the Government of India enacted the Disaster Management Act, which envisaged the creation of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers. **Source :** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-economic-losses-natural-catastrophes-9779008/) * * * ​ ​ ​ Submit * * * ![logo](https://www.vajiramandravi.com/_next/static/media/badge_logo.5fb7c7f1.svg) © 2025 Vajiram & Ravi.

The most notorious civil struggle has been the conflict with Kashmir insurgents, a border conflict between India and Pakistan that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The group was inspired by the agrarian revolution ideology as a means to achieve equality. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. The Naxalites are considered far-left radical communists and are declared a terrorist group under Indian law. In this report we will look into the Maoist movement in India, starting with its history. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group’s success and the global geopolitical consequences. **[View the full report](https://www.confluenceinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/weekly_geopolitical_report_10_28_2013.pdf)** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors.

[Sign up](https://subscribe.bylinetimes.com/newsletter-signup/) While the world focuses on the spectacle of India carrying out [its biggest national election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Indian_general_election) – with 960 million Indian citizens eligible to vote out of a population of 1.4 billion – serious unrest continues to haunt the state of Manipur. For the last five months, _Byline Times_ has continued to receive detailed weekly updates from frontline activists in the northeastern state. These catalogue ongoing communal violence between different ethnic and religious groups that is subverting social and political life in the remote region. Building on the conflict recounted in a [previous _Byline Times_ report](https://bylinetimes.com/2023/10/19/state-complicity-and-ethnic-cleansing-in-india/), this unrest has now been taking place for a year. The situation highlights a distinct disconnect between the apparent virtues of India as the world’s largest [democracy](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/) and the ongoing restriction of human rights in the country.

These non-Hindu tribal groups include the Kuki, Zomi, Mizo and Chin, which are more widely termed as the [Zo people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo_people). Activists maintain that, courtesy of their links to the ruling state [ministers](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/11/19/amid-the-media-noise-about-cronyism-keir-starmer-is-quietly-reforming-political-standards-for-the-better/) and sympathetic [police](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/11/only-a-tiny-fraction-of-child-abuse-allegations-made-by-victims-are-leading-to-charges/) groupings, the Meitei are being aided by official connivance in their carrying out of “ethnic pogroms”. Zo leaders note their [discrimination](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/09/police-race-action-plan-slammed/) by state officials and processes of “selective justice”, whereby Zo are presented as “anti-nationals” and are much more likely to be prosecuted.

Such accusations come in the midst of continuing violence perpetrated by Meitei tribals and [well-armed militias, such as the Arambai Tenggol](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/explained-who-are-meitei-radical-group-arambai-tenggol-and-why-did-they-summon-manipur-lawmakers) and [Meitei Leepun](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/manipur-violence-it-is-a-global-war-says-meitei-leepun-leader-pramot-singh-interview/article67004485.ece).

Villages have also faced attacks by [Meitei militias using automatic weapons and mortars](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/violence-continues-in-manipur-mortars-and-automatic-weapons-used/article67253119.ece). Often these incidents have been photographed and filmed, before being shared on social [media](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/10/21/telegraph-misled-readers-on-climate-change-impact-rules-press-watchdog-in-rare-slap-down/) platforms to incite violence and intimidate targeted tribals. This unrest has been intensive and systematic over the last 12 months and by October 2023 more than 70,000 people (including 12,000 children) had been displaced. It has been heightened by [periodic internet bans](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/manipur-violence-internet-services-restored-border-areas-exception-meiteis-kukis-2471548-2023-12-04) and the use of fake news by Meitei media groups, as well as utilising large [protest](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/12/when-peaceful-protesters-face-harsher-sentences-than-violent-racists-something-has-to-give/) mobs to demand the removal of non-Meitei public officials.

It was alleged in December 2023 that the Meitei had used a drone to drop a looted mortar bomb on a village, and that the Manipur Government had provided drone training.

This process has included being labelled as refugees, illegal immigrants or [“narco-terrorists”](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/northeast/2023/jul/29/massive-rally-in-manipur-protestors-demand-nrc-action-against-chin-kuki-narco-terrorists-2599921.html), or having links with Myanmar or Bangladesh. Related to these phenomena is the continued religious persecution of the Christian-majority Zo by the Hindu-majority Meitei, which has included [the burning of 357 churches](https://www.opendoors.org.au/frontline-faith/understanding-manipur-what-led-to-the-recent-violence-against-christians-in-india/) since May. Evidence has also surfaced of Zo graves being desecrated. Such claims come despite the existence of regional [Meitei drug gangs](https://thewire.in/security/manipur-violence-poppy-national-security-golden-triangle) and the increased interception by Indian security forces of armed Meitei militia members infiltrating India across the Myanmar border. This discrimination has raised fears that the communal violence aims to force non-Meitei tribals from their land, in order [to monopolise oil, gas and mineral reserves](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/at-the-core-of-manipurs-ethnic-strife-is-fight-over-tribal-land-rights) (such as uranium and platinum). The normalization of violence and population displacement accentuates such a threat. State complicity also plays a role, with Meitei leaders having linkages to big mining corporations eager to exploit such valuable natural commodities. In some areas, power supplies to non-Meitei villages have been sabotaged, leaving them without power or telecommunications for days. Elsewhere, non-Meitei villages have been blockaded by militias, preventing the delivery of essential food and commodities. Signalling a further escalation, in January 2024, [the central Manipur government conceded security control of Imphal to the Arambai Tenggol](https://thediplomat.com/2024/01/abject-surrender-of-the-state-to-armed-militia-in-indias-manipur/). This gave the Meitei militia dominance over security arrangements in Manipur’s capital and – given the militia’s ongoing violence – is an ugly portent for the local non-Meitei population. Meitei legislators were reportedly forced to declare allegiance to the Arambai Tenggol. In the months since the Arambai Tenggol took over, Imphal has seen a rise in armed intimidation, extortion, the illegal occupation of property, and even the [use of improvised explosive devices](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/one-dead-one-injured-blast-indias-manipur-state-2024-02-24/), or IEDs.

Other groups are also recasting the anniversary of the day that Manipur joined the Indian Union on 21 September 1949 as now being a “Black Day” of protest. Additional groups have protested calling for an end to gender-based violence and violence against students. Further collectives are demanding the setting up of an independent Zo administration in Manipur. Coupled with these movements are increasing calls for the Zo areas of Manipur to merge with those in the neighbouring state of Mizoram, especially given the ongoing displacement of the Zo. Within this context, the response by the central government in New Delhi continues to be seen as lax and insufficient. Although the troubles in Manipur are receiving greater national coverage, [Prime Minister Narendra Modi has resisted calls to visit the region](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/indian-opposition-walks-out-as-narendra-modi-refuses-to-discuss-manipur-conflict). This comes despite the severe economic and social damage being wrought upon its people, as well as the slow Meitei domination of Manipur’s state bureaucracies. The 2024 [general election](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/08/28/stark-figures-reveal-how-many-londoners-were-turned-away-due-to-voter-id-in-general-election/) may be a factor here, with the BJP seeking to hold the [Inner Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency) (that includes the regional capital Imphal) and possibly gain the [Outer Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency), which it lost to the Naga People’s Front by 73,782 votes in 2019. Moreover, such a blind eye can also potentially be explained by the BJP’s deeper aim to actively assimilate all India’s minorities towards its Hindu majoritarian outlook. Escalating Meitei-instigated violence against Manipur’s tribal groups certainly – and usefully – fits with such a dynamic and appears to be increasingly successful. It also strengthens narratives of India’s Hindu population being threatened by non-Hindus. A BJP victory in the 2024 national [elections](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/) will only hasten such a forced “harmonisation”, with negative consequences for other non-Hindu groups, regions, and states across India. * * * ##### Written by [Chris Ogden](https://bylinetimes.com/author/chrisogden/) * * * ##### This article was filed under [Christianity](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/christianity/), [Democracy](https://bylinetimes.com/category/democracy/), [Hinduism](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/hinduism/), [India](https://bylinetimes.com/category/foreign-affairs/india-foreign-affairs/)",

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

This was the Bay of Bengal’s first tropical cyclone of the year and, according to news reports, it was so severe that flood protection embankments washed away, and millions were left without power after the network infrastructure experienced severe damage. As result of the storm’s 135kmph (84mph) winds, Kolkata airport closed, shipping was halted at Chittagong seaport, and schools closed as evacuees moved to over 9,000 cyclone shelters with assistance from India's National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Cyclones in Indian coastal zones are not a new phenomenon, but they have increased in number and magnitude in recent years [\\[1\\]](https://www.thebci.org/news/the-rising-storm-of-climate-risks-in-india.html#citation1), creating concerns for resilience professionals over escalating climate risks to the country. Vaidyanathan Chandramouli, India’s [BCI Chennai Chapter](https://www.thebci.org/group/india-chennai.html) Leader, said: > _“Climate risk is indeed a significant concern in India. Recent observations have shown irregularities in monsoon patterns, with some regions experiencing reduced rainfall with others facing excessive downpours. This inconsistency is marked by periods of heavy rain followed by abrupt stops, disrupting the usual monsoon cycle. Additionally, there is a noticeable rise in maximum temperatures across the country. Traditionally cooler regions are warming, and winters are becoming more severe”._ He adds: > _“The primary concern posed by climate-related events in our region is the threat to supply chains and loss of premises. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events can disrupt operations, damage infrastructure, and create significant logistical challenges. Additionally, the warming of cooler regions leads to increased use of air conditioning, which contributes to global warming, while the intensification of winters necessitates heating equipment, creating a vicious cycle in the long run.”_ Vaidyanathan reported that business continuity and resilience practitioners in India are exploring how to diversify and decentralise operations to better manage risks and adapt infrastructure to withstand extreme weather. Another avenue is exploring enhanced early warning systems to support timely evacuation and asset protection. However, support from top management is crucial in addressing these concerns effectively, as it is only with adequate support that organizations can implement the necessary measures to build climate resilience and ensure long-term preparedness. This is a change from traditional business continuity management that deals with the effects of disruption in order get back on track with critical activities into a more proactive approach of strategic thinking that modifies organizational structures and adapts infrastructure in advance. However, Vaidyanathan added: > “Currently, there is limited understanding of these concerns, especially in countries like India, where small and medium enterprises (SMEs) significantly contribute to the economy. Their primary focus tends to be business sustainability rather than climate sustainability.” The [BCI Climate Risk Report 2023](https://www.thebci.org/news/new-report-shows-climate-risk-priorities-for-bc-and-resilience-professionals.html) underlines Vaidyanathan’s response. Survey respondents from around the world said that threats related to climate-related events are on the rise. Indeed, 44.4% of respondents stated they had seen a moderate or significant impact from climate related events over the past five years with rainfall and flooding topping the list as their primary climate-related concern. Extreme heat/heatwaves, hurricanes and tornadoes, and wildfires also posed risks, as did the new and rising concern of water scarcity. As a result of increasing climate threats, 47% of respondents highlighted supply chain interruption as their primary concern. Staff absenteeism, loss of premises and power, and revenue dips are also significant potential threats. However, despite these wide-ranging outcomes and the notable rise in events, 22.1% of respondents report their organization has yet to consider climate risk on their risk agenda. To face the rising tide of climate threats, practitioners should seek to align business continuity plans to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) propositions and ensure provision of adequate back-up systems for power and communications. As demonstrated by Cyclone Remal, climate-related events are increasing in ferocity and frequency, and, without any associated legislative regulations to enforce organizational action, ensuring climate risk remains a topic on top management agendas is key to embedding genuine commitment to mitigate climate risk, as well as ensuring a proactive approach is taken. * * * ### Citations \\[1\\][https://climatefactchecks.org/climate-change-leading-to-rise-in-intensity-of-cyclones-along-indias-coastline/](https://climatefactchecks.org/climate-change-leading-to-rise-in-intensity-of-cyclones-along-indias-coastline/) ###### More on -

The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about. However, the announcement came just hours after cross-border attacks had sharply escalated, with India reportedly striking several Pakistani airbases, including one near Islamabad, to which Pakistan responded by reportedly hitting two...",

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(ANNIRUDHA MOOKERJEE/AFP/Getty Images) For more than two months, Chinese and Indian forces have stood toe to toe on the Doklam Plateau. The standoff is just the latest manifestation of a border dispute that began long before Chinese soldiers tried to extend a road through the contested region June 16 -- and one that extends well past the area in question. Along the thousands of kilometers of sinuous border between China and India lie three main points of contention: Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The regions are the most likely sites of a military confrontation between China and India, and each presents its own set of strategic considerations....

Some of the most violent attacks conducted by the Naxalites have been against police transport and freight trains, killing dozens of people at a time. The Naxalites specifically inhabit an area known as the \"Red Corridor,\" which stretches from West Bengal state southwest to Karnataka state. The most violent states in this corridor have been Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Orissa. The region is defined by rolling hills covered in dense forest and has few improved roads, which allows the Naxalites to control access. The dense foliage also protects them from government aircraft.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

Image: Tata Power. The build-out of India’s power transmission network is lagging behind the country’s rapid growth in renewable energy, leading to project delays and cost increases. That is the conclusion of a report out today from think-tank IEEFA South Asia and market analysts JMK Research, which reveals that over 50GW of renewable energy capacity was stranded across India as of June this year due to transmission constraints. ## Try Premium for just $1 - Full premium access for the first month at only $1 - Converts to an annual rate after 30 days unless cancelled - Cancel anytime during the trial period [Start $1 Trial](https://www.pv-tech.org/invite/L579GzIZSq1k4q2HHP) ### Premium Benefits - Expert industry analysis and interviews - Digital access to PV Tech Power journal - Exclusive event discounts ### Or get the full Premium subscription right away [Get Premium Subscription](https://www.pv-tech.org/grid-constraints-threatening-indias-renewable-energy-targets-report/) ### Or continue reading this article for free [Get Basic (FREE) Subscription](https://www.pv-tech.org/grid-constraints-threatening-indias-renewable-energy-targets-report/) The report said these constraints are limiting the pace at which new capacity can be brought online and undermining India’s ability to reach its clean energy targets. According to the report, the most recent network expansion figures reveal a 42% gap between planned and commissioned transmission lines, with Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) additions at their lowest in a decade. Annual transmission line additions have fallen short of planned levels since 2019, with only 2021 surpassing expectations, the report noted. “In several high-demand corridors, speculative hoarding of transmission capacity by entities without genuine project intent has driven up connectivity prices and delayed access for viable projects,” said the report’s contributing author, Vibhuti Garg, IEEFA’s South Asia director. “Right-of-way issues, extended land acquisition timelines, restrictions on equipment procurement, and multi-agency approvals also contribute to delays,” added Prabhakar Sharma, co-author of the report and a senior consultant at JMK Research. The report highlighted the mismatch between variable generation and grid consumption as part of the problem. While solar generation aligns with the afternoon peak consumption pattern, it tapers off in the evening when demand is high, creating a gap that limits the integration of renewables and leads to the underutilisation of transmission corridors. Energy storage is vital to bridge this gap, the report said. It singled out the state of Rajasthan, where 8GW of renewable energy capacity remains stranded, with nearly half of that curtailed during peak solar hours. Delayed completion of the Associated Transmission System, the dedicated transmission infrastructure linked to new generation projects, along with capacity hoarding and ecological directives, has compounded evacuation challenges, inflated project costs and reduced operational efficiency. IEEFA and JMK said a unified generation-transmission planning framework that aligns timelines and locations for new generation and transmission capacity was a key part of the solution. This would involve a coordinated approach, combining regulatory reform, operational efficiency measures and capital mobilisation. The integration of energy storage systems should also be prioritised in renewable-rich regions to enhance capacity utilisation and reduce curtailment, the report added. Specific measures identified in the report include a single-window clearance system to streamline land, right of way and connectivity approvals, and performance-based incentives and disincentives tied to asset utilisation metrics to encourage timely commissioning and sustained operations. “Without targeted reforms, misalignment between generation commissioning and evacuation infrastructure is likely to continue driving congestion, curtailment, and systemic inefficiencies, ultimately slowing progress towards achieving India’s decarbonisation objectives,” the report concluded.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 October 2024 By Sema Hasan, Senior Policy Analyst Increasing Abuses against Religious Minorities in India Introduction Religious freedom conditions in India have continued to worsen throughout 2024, particularly in the months prior to and immediately following the country’s national elections. In addition to the enforcement of discriminatory state-level legislation and propagation of hateful rhetoric, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government made a concerted effort to implement election promises that negatively and disproportionately impacted religious minorities and their ability to practice their faith. Such promises included enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), inaugurating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and introducing a national code to replace religion-specific personal laws. Each action was justified by government officials as necessary to protect India’s “cultural [and] linguistic heritage”—a common euphemism for Hindu supremacy, often at the expense of religious minorities. This report provides an overview of the various religious freedom violations that have taken place in India during 2024. It focuses on changes to the country’s legal framework, including the strengthening of discriminatory legislation like state-level anti-conversion and anti-terrorism laws, as well as the implementation of the CAA and the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). It also examines the increasing frequency of attacks against religious minorities and their advocates, including the targeting of places of worship. Laws and Other Challenges to Religious Freedom at the National Level The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) In May 2024, the Indian government published the rules for implementing the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), fulfilling a long-anticipated BJP campaign promise. Amending the country’s 1955 Citizenship Act, the CAA established a religious criterion for fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants (from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, or Christian communities) fleeing neighboring Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The law excludes Muslim refugees, including Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka. The act states that an individual must have lived or worked in India prior to December 31, 2014, in order to apply for citizenship. www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov Stephen Schneck Chair Eric Ueland Vice Chair Commissioners Mohamed Elsanousi Maureen Ferguson Susie Gelman Vicky Hartzler Asif Mahmood Meir Soloveichik Erin D. Singshinsuk Executive Director USCIRF’s Mission To advance international freedom of religion or belief, by independently assessing and unflinchingly confronting threats to this fundamental right. 2 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Critics argue that the CAA violates the Indian constitution’s principles prohibiting religious discrimination and its guarantees of equal protection under the law. Mass protests followed the initial announcement in 2019, in which hundreds were injured and thousands arrested—some of whom remained in detention as of September 2024, including Umar Khalid, Meeran Haider, and Sharjeel Imam. The recent announcement of the implementation rules initiated a surge of new protests as well as a number of petitions challenging the CAA before the Supreme Court. Several Indian states have expressed opposition to the CAA. In 2019, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh all moved resolutions against the CAA. In February 2024, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu stressed that he would not allow implementation of the CAA in that state, as he would “stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan brethren.” Similarly, in March, the chief minister of West Bengal voiced her opposition to the act, arguing that it would be used to “turn legal citizens into foreigners.” Kerala was the first state to legally challenge the CAA and in March renewed its 2020 plea before the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the law’s classification based on religion and country is discriminatory. In June, the Madhya Pradesh government granted Indian citizenship to three applicants under the CAA. National Register of Citizens (NRC) Human rights advocates argue that the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in combination with the CAA, would allow the Indian government to expel those it deemed noncitizens, posing particular risk to the country’s Muslim population. The government first piloted the NRC in Assam in 2018, when it sought to separate Indian citizens from “undocumented immigrants” living in that state. The NRC requires residents to prove they or their ancestors had entered Assam prior to March 24, 1971, or face exclusion from the register. In 2019, the Assam government published its list of names of those it considered Indian citizens according to the NRC, omitting 1.9 million names. Of these 1.9 million, an estimated 700,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Bengali Hindus, and 200,000 were from the Assamese Hindu groups Koch-Rajbongshi, Das, Kalita, and Sarma. In July 2024, the Assam government ordered police to cease referring people entitled to Indian citizenship— under the CAA—to Foreigners’ Tribunals, which function as quasi-judicial bodies that authorities task with determining whether an individual is a “suspected foreigner.” Despite this order, police in Assam that same month, in conjunction with the Foreigners’ Tribunals, declared 28 Muslims as “non-citizens” and sent them to a deportation center. In September, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that all individuals must submit an NRC application in order to receive identity cards. New Delhi India USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 3 Expropriation and Demolition of Places of Worship and Muslim Property Since the beginning of 2024, Indian authorities have facilitated the expropriation of places of worship, including the construction of Hindu temples on the sites of mosques. Most notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in January, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Indian authorities had constructed the temple atop the ruins of the Babri Masjid, which a Hindu mob had demolished in 1992 in their belief that it marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site was long contested; India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the mosque’s destruction was an “egregious violation” of the law and yet granted the site to Hindus while offering Muslims a separate plot of land to construct a new mosque—which remains unbuilt as of September 2024. The days following the temple’s January 2024 consecration were marked by a series of attacks and other instances of intolerance against religious minorities across six states. In each instance, violence erupted following Hindu nationalist processions through predominantly Muslim neighbors. In Maharashtra, violence broke out along Mira Road, where police stood by as mobs vandalized dozens of Muslim-owned shops. Several reports indicate that the police arrested Muslim youths, despite receiving dozens of complaints against the actions of the Hindu mob. In the aftermath of the Mira Road violence, municipal authorities returned with bulldozers to demolish structures they deemed illegal. Commonly referred to as “bulldozer justice,” state authorities have repeatedly used bulldozers to demolish Muslim property under the guise of removing “illegal” structures, including homes, businesses, and places of worship. In February, for example, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the 600-year-old Akhoondji Mosque, alleging that the building was an illegal encroachment. The mosque’s imam argued that he did not receive written notice before the demolition. The DDA has also announced its intention to demolish 20 religious structures in the forested areas of Sanjay Van, including 16 Muslim shrines. A court order claimed that Delhi “already had sufficient dargahs and temples” and that the forest needed restoration. The same month, in Uttarakhand, the demolition of a mosque and Muslim seminary by police and government officials sparked deadly clashes and an internet shutdown. In July, the DDA demolished the Faizyab Mosque and Madrassa in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area. Places of Worship Act Beyond demolitions, the government has expropriated several mosques for alternative purposes, directly violating India’s Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. The 1991 act froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed in August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith. While the act does not apply to the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, it extends protection to all other places of worship. Despite this law, an Indian court ruled in February that Hindus can worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, which Hindus claim rests on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The same month, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav called for the repeal of the Places of Worship Act, calling it “unconstitutional.” Waqf Amendment Bill In addition, many Muslims have expressed concern regarding the Indian government’s introduction of the Waqf Amendment Bill in August, which seeks to repeal the 1995 Waqf Act. A waqf is an endowment (movable or immovable) that Muslims can give for a specific pious or charitable purpose, according to Islamic tradition. Once registered as a waqf, such property—which may include land, graveyards, or buildings—is deemed nontransferable and held in perpetuity as such. All mosques in India are considered waqf properties, under the management of Muslim bodies in every state, known as Waqf Boards. The 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to broaden the government’s regulatory authority over these endowments and proposes the mandatory inclusion of non-Muslim members on Waqf Boards. It also seeks to prohibit the designation of a given property as a waqf based on its owner’s oral declaration alone. Legal experts and Muslim leaders argue that these provisions would erode their community’s autonomy over its own religious institutions. The introduction of this legislation follows the increased proliferation of disinformation regarding the distribution of wealth among India’s Muslim communities, including derogatory comments that Prime Minister Modi made during the national election. 4 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 State and Local Laws Impacting Religious Minorities Uniform Civil Code and Personal Status Laws Since 2019, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have articulated their intention to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to overrule existing personal laws that are highly integrated with religious beliefs. Such personal laws include areas such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession. Critics argue that a UCC would contradict secular principles while failing to adequately represent the needs and values of the country’s myriad and diverse religious communities. In February, the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand passed a state-level UCC bill, establishing a uniform set of rules on personal status law that includes marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. This bill is widely considered to represent a template for other states to adopt. The UCC sets the minimum age for marriage at 18. While Hindu and secular laws set age restrictions for men and women, there are no such limitations for Muslims and other communities. Some Muslim communities have characterized the UCC as a threat to Islamic practices, preferring to observe Shari’a as the basis for personal law, and some Sikh organizations have similarly rejected it, arguing that it “undermines Sikh identity.” The UCC further requires “live-in” relationships to be registered within a month and establishes criminal punishments, including six months in jail, for failing to do so. Such provisions would allow for further policing of interfaith couples, who already face risks including threats of violence from family members. In July, for example, the Uttarakhand high court directed police to provide protection to an interfaith couple in a live-in relationship and instructed them to register under the UCC. The couple reported receiving threats from their parents about their relationship. Anti-Conversion Laws In addition to the UCC and other legislation, authorities frequently used state-level policies throughout the first part of 2024, including anti-conversion laws, to target religious minorities across India. As USCIRF previously reported, 12 of India’s 28 states currently maintain anti\u0002conversion laws and enforce them to varying degrees. These laws prohibit conversion under circumstances that far exceed cases of coercion, and they are often punishable by hefty fines and prison terms. Authorities frequently enforce such laws under the pretext of preventing so-called “love jihad”—a conspiracy theory that claims Muslim men target and seduce Hindu women for conversion to Islam—while in effect targeting interfaith relationships. Since the beginning of the year, authorities have arrested dozens of Christians on allegations of conducting or participating in forced conversions. In June, for example, police in Uttar Pradesh detained 13 Christians, including four pastors; in July, seven Christians faced accusations of violating the state’s anti-conversion law in two separate incidents. That same month, government officials from Uttar Pradesh tabled a bill that would strengthen the state’s anti-conversion law, including expanding the punishment for conversion to life imprisonment, allowing anyone to file a First Instance Report (FIR) against suspected violators, and making religious conversion a nonbailable offense. Several other states made similar efforts to introduce or strengthen existing anti-conversion laws. In February, for example, the state of Chhattisgarh announced it would introduce legislation to address “illegal conversion,” claiming that Christian pastors had forcibly converted Hindus. In February, the Assam government passed the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Bill, which bans individuals or groups from performing “non\u0002scientific” healing, such as prayer, to treat illnesses. The chief minister of Assam further noted his intention to restrict Christian evangelism and conversion in the state with the bill. In April, the government of Gujarat issued a circular mandating that Hindus wishing to convert to Buddhism, Sikhism, or Jainism obtain approval from their district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. In June, the BJP-led government in Rajasthan withdrew its 2008 anti-conversion law in favor of new legislation aimed at “curbing alleged cases of ‘love jihad’” and religious conversion. Additionally, as of August, appeals challenging the constitutionality of anti\u0002conversion laws were pending in seven states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Anti-Cow Slaughter Laws India’s constitution directs states to take steps to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, considered sacred in Hinduism. As a result, 20 of India’s 28 states currently enforce anti-cow slaughter laws. Vigilante groups and self-proclaimed “cow protectors” frequently exploit such laws to target religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits. USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 5 An estimated dozen attacks involving “cow vigilantism” took place following India’s national elections in June. In August, for example, a group of cow vigilantes beat a Muslim migrant worker to death, falsely accusing him of having eaten beef. A day later, a group of Hindu men violently attacked a 72-year-old Muslim man because they believed he was carrying beef in his bag. The same month, a group of “cow protectors” shot and killed a 19-year-old Hindu student because they thought he was a Muslim smuggling cows. While arrests were made in each of these cases, perpetrators of such attacks often operate with impunity; they rarely face punishment and are often released on bail within 24 hours. Other Significant Religious Freedom Challenges across India Hate Speech, Misinformation and Disinformation In the leadup to the June 2024 elections, political officials increasingly wielded hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims and other religious minorities. Prime Minister Modi repeatedly claimed that the opposition party would “wipe out [the] Hindu faith from the country” and had plans to make Hindus “second class citizens in their own country.” He perpetuated hateful stereotypes about Muslims, referring to them as “infiltrators.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah echoed these statements and insisted falsely that opposition leaders would impose Shari’a if elected—despite the fact that the opposition election manifesto included no mention of Shari’a or Muslims. Additionally, misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech by Indian government officials frequently fuel and incite cow vigilantism and other attacks against religious minorities. The attacks against Muslims in Mira Road following the inauguration of the Ram Temple in January, for example, erupted following inflammatory speeches by two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain. Rane reportedly openly threatened the Muslim community, using offensive language and urging the Hindu community to “ignite and retaliate.” While First Instance Reports (FIRs) were filed against Rane and Jain, Mumbai police argued in July that the use of terms like “jihadis,” “Rohingya,” and “Bangladeshis” were not aimed at the Muslim community and therefore did not fall under Section 295A of the penal code. The same month, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about an increase in hate speech targeting Rohingya refugees and the Indian government’s role in arbitrary mass detention and forcible return of that community to Burma. Following Rane and Jain’s speeches, BJP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) T. Raja Singh gave a 40-minute speech in February stoking religious tensions, in which he openly called for violence against Muslims and for the further demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura. Singh claimed that Muslims were facilitating the forceful conversion of Hindus and repeatedly referred to Rohingya and Bangladeshi Muslims as “illegal.” He encouraged his audience to be “prepared to fight for the protection of our country and religion” and to fight against “love jihad,” forced conversion, and cow slaughter. Attacks against Religious Minorities In March, a group of UN experts raised alarm about the level of violence and hate crimes against religious minorities in the leadup to national elections, including vigilante violence, targeted and arbitrary killings, demolition of property, and harassment. They called on the Indian government to fulfill its obligation to prohibit religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and violence. From January to March 161 incidents of violence against Christians in India were reported—47 of which occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh. Such incidents ranged from violent attacks on churches and prayer meetings to physical assaults, harassment, and false allegations of forced conversion. Muslims continued to be targeted, as well. In March, a group of Hindus in Gujarat violently attacked foreign Muslim university students as they gathered for prayer during Ramadan. The university subsequently issued new guidelines, instructing students not to pray in common spaces. Moreover, following the election results, during which the BJP lost its national majority, at least 28 attacks against Muslims occurred from June to August. Religious educational institutions were also subjected to harassment and targeting. In February, for example, Hindu organizations entered a Catholic school in Assam and demanded instructors cease using Christian images and symbols. In March, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment striking down a previous ruling on the governance of madrasas, effectively banning Islamic schools in that state and ordering the public school enrollment of students whom the closures had impacted. 6 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Crackdown on Civil Society and Faith-Based Organizations In 2024 the government of India has expanded its tactics of repression to target religious minorities and their advocates abroad. Journalists, academics, and civil society organizations documenting India’s religious freedom violations have reported facing denial of consular services, including the revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards as well as threats of violence and surveillance. In April, international reporting linked an official in India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to the 2023 assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist in New York. Additionally, Indian authorities have repeatedly used discriminatory legislation to target religious communities and those advocating on their behalf. Authorities continued to exploit antiterror and financing laws, including the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to crack down on civil society organizations, religious minorities, human rights defenders, and journalists reporting on religious freedom. The UAPA was enacted in 1967 but amended in 2019, allowing the government to designate individuals as “terrorists” without due process. The law vaguely defines “unlawful activity” as any action “intended to disrupt India’s sovereignty, integrity or security,” including “disruptive speech.” In 2024, several religious minorities and human rights activists have continued to face detention without trial under the UAPA, including Hany Babu and Rona Wilson. Academic and human rights activist GN Saibaba, whom authorities detained under the UAPA in 2017 for criticizing state violence against religious minorities, was ultimately released in March but described how police had abused him, tortured him, and denied him medical care while in custody. Similarly, organizations that document and advocate for religious freedom continue to face harassment and, in some cases, are forced to shut down operations. Like the UAPA, authorities have used India’s Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to obstruct the work of civil society organizations. FCRA regulates access to foreign funds for individuals and organizations and prohibits receipt of foreign funds for “any activities [deemed] detrimental to the national interest” of India. The law requires nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to apply for FCRA licenses to received foreign funding, but authorities can readily revoke such licenses. In April, India’s Home Ministry canceled the FCRA licenses of five NGOs, preventing them from using existing funds. Those NGOs included the Church of North India (CNI) Synodical Board of Social Service, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, and Evangelical Fellowship of India. In total, the Indian government has canceled over 20,000 FCRA registrations since 2012. Replacing India’s Criminal Code In July, the Indian government moved to replace its colonial-era criminal laws with three new laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA). These laws replaced the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1872 Indian Evidence Act, respectively. Human rights groups argue that the enforcement of these new laws may have exacerbated the targeting of religious minorities and their advocates. Such legislation may pose an additional threat to freedom of expression, association, and right to a free trial, particularly for religious minorities. The BNS specifically adds a new provision criminalizing “acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India” and increases the minimum punishment from three years to seven. It also expands the criminalization of the promotion of “enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion” to include electronic communications. Reporting indicates that this provision has already served as a pretext for targeting journalists who reported on an alleged mob lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh. The BNSS additionally allows for police to seek 15-day detention of an accused individual at any time before they have completed 40–60 days of the allowed remand period. UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief. Professional Staff Michael Ardovino Policy Analyst Susan Bishai Senior Policy Analyst Mollie Blum Policy Analyst Guillermo Cantor Director of Research and Policy Elizabeth K. Cassidy Senior Strategic Advisor Mingzhi Chen Supervisory Policy Advisor Patrick Greenwalt Policy Analyst Sema Hasan Senior Policy Analyst Thomas Kraemer Chief Administrative Officer Veronica McCarthy Public Affairs Associate Hilary Miller Policy Analyst Nora Morton Operations Specialist Dylan Schexnaydre Policy Analyst Scott Weiner Supervisory Policy Analyst Luke Wilson International Legal Specialist Kurt Werthmuller Deputy Director of Research and Policy Nathan Wineinger Chief of Public Affairs Jean Wu Policy Analyst Conclusion Religious freedom conditions in India continue to follow a deteriorating and concerning trajectory. The Indian government continues to repress and restrict religious communities through the enforcement of discriminatory legislation like anti-conversion laws, cow slaughter laws, and antiterrorism laws. In doing so, authorities have arbitrarily detained individuals highlighting violations of religious freedom, including religious leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, without due process—in some cases for years. Indian officials have repeatedly employed hateful and derogatory rhetoric and misinformation to perpetuate false narratives about religious minorities, inciting widespread violence, lynchings, and demolition of places of worship. In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in particularly severe religious freedom violations. This report further outlines a number of policy recommendations that the U.S. government can take to address religious freedom violations in India, including issuing targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, conditioning arms sales based on improved religious freedom conditions, and incorporating religious freedom priorities into bilateral meetings with Indian government counterparts.",

    "full_text": "Since US President Donald Trump’s imposition of a 50% tariff rate on India (25% reciprocal tariff plus a 25% Russia penalty), the standoff between India and the Unites States has continued. In this article, we look at possible scenarios and medium-term implications in light of these tariffs being implemented. India has maintained a defiant stance on protecting farmers’ interests. Multiple outcomes are possible from here, with different implications. On trade, the US and India have held five rounds of negotiations, where India offered zero tariffs on industrial goods, and agreed to gradually reduce tariffs on US cars, but disagreements emerged over India’s reluctance to open its agriculture (genetically modified crops) and dairy sectors, which are politically important for President Trump. A fundamental misalignment also emerged between the two nations' approaches: India sought a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement, while it appears the Trump administration preferred a quick deal. India's response has been notably resolute across multiple fronts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emphasized unwavering protection of farmers' interests, even at personal cost, and has encouraged citizens to buy goods domestically. Within India, both opposition leaders and business community representatives have rallied behind the government's position, accepting short-term economic pain over perceived international pressure. In our base case, we assume the 25% reciprocal tariff remains in place through FY26, but the 25% Russian penalty is effective only until November. As such, we expect GDP growth at 6.6% y-o-y in FY26, after considering other policy offsets. On the other hand, if both sides dig in their heels, resulting in a continuation of the 50% tariff rate, then we would expect the hit to GDP growth to be 0.8 percentage points on an annualized rate basis. The current account deficit is also likely to deteriorate to around 1.1% of GDP. We see significant spillovers hitting investment and consumption through job losses in export intensive sectors, with further escalation risks through tariffs or non-tariff barriers. With the new tariff structure, the cost differential between India and China has narrowed, and between India and Southeast Asian competitors, it has moved in favor of the latter. This could have various effects on the shape of new supply chains such as the negative impact on textiles, leather and toys, and Indian firms possibly relocating their production to lower tariff countries to retain their US customer base. However, this will merely disrupt global value chain integration for India, not derail it entirely. We expect the government to announce a multi-pronged response, with fiscal and financial support for exporters, focus on export diversification and fast-tracking free trade agreements. More reforms are also likely. Goods and services tax rationalization has already been announced, and we expect further reforms such as FDI liberalization, deregulation, factor market reforms, privatization, and administrative reforms.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) After many years of infrastructure development and gradual encroachment, China is accelerating efforts to secure its military presence and access to water rights along the Indian border near Ladakh. But while it appears Beijing has largely achieved this objective for now, the harsh Himalayan winter could again escalate its standoff with India by challenging China's ability to maintain a presence throughout the disputed territory....

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders.

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk.

But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

    "full_text": "If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up...",

The two countries are close to a short-term trade deal, but a long-term pact is an entirely different proposition. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) The United States' trade war with China grabs all the headlines, but U.S. President Donald Trump is also bearing down on another major Asian economy: India. In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain goods at a reduced tariff rate. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration retaliated by slapping tariffs on 28 U.S. goods. While the sides could soon clinch a short-term trade deal, the United States and India will have several outstanding issues to address before they finalize a more comprehensive pact. With the United States demanding that India reduce its bilateral trade surplus, open its economy to more U.S. agricultural products and go easier on U.S. technology giants, the countries remain far apart on a longer-term deal....

Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance Washington could start imposing tariffs against a wider...
