The victim had been forcibly disappeared from the Jusak area of Turbat on April 15. On April 16, 2025, the tortured body of a Baloch youth, Farooq Ahmed, who was the younger son of Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) leader Noor Ahmed Mengal, recovered from the Nall area of Khuzdar District. Farooq Ahmed had reportedly been forcibly disappeared on April 14. Noor Ahmed Mengal is the BNP-M’s vice president in Khuzdar District. BNP-Mengal stated that Farooq’s father, Noor Ahmed Mengal, had been actively participating in the protest sit-in near Lakpass in recent days, which was held in opposition to the arrest of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) leaders. On April 15, 2025, the tortured dead body of a forcibly disappeared’ person, Nizam, son of Mohammad, who had been abducted earlier in the month from Babbar Shor, was discovered in the Pasni area of Gwadar District. On April 15, 2025, the dead body of a forcibly disappeared Baloch man, Abu Bakar, was recovered in the Buleda area of Kech District. On April 7, 2025, three bullet-riddled dead bodies of forcibly disappeared persons were recovered from the Mehma Samand Khan area of Barkhan District. The deceased were identified as Haq Nawaz Buzdar, Shero Buzdar, and Gul Zaman Buzdar, all from the Buzdar tribe. Local sources said Haq Nawaz was picked up from his home in Musakhel District on April 5, while Shero had been missing for the past nine months. On April 7, 2025, the dead body of forcibly disappeared Nadir Baloch was recovered from the Kandhari area of Mashkay in the Awaran District. Nadir Baloch, was allegedly ‘disappeared’ by SFs on April 6, and his bullet-riddled body was found dumped in a remote area a day later. On April 6, 2025, two Baloch men, Mehrab s/o Rehamdil and Khan Mohammad s/o Haibtan, were tortured to death after their alleged “enforced disappearance” from their homes in the Gardank area of Buleda _tehsil_ (revenue unit) in Kech District. On April 5, 2025, three bullet-riddled bodies of forcibly disappeared persons were recovered in Mashkay area of Awaran District. The victims were identified as Zahoor s/o Huzoor, Shah Nawaz s/o Jalal, and Habib s/o Eido. On April 17, 2025, while strongly denouncing the recent resurfacing of dead bodies of forcibly disappeared persons, the Baloch Women Forum (BWF) raised serious concerns about the resurgence of the infamous “Kill and Dump” policy in Balochistan, stating that it casts serious doubt on the State’s commitment to international human rights standards. According to a BWF spokesperson, this development only reinforces the Baloch people’s ongoing feelings of exclusion from the federation. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), based on open media sources, at least 13 bullet-riddled bodies have recovered in Balochistan during the first 18 days of April (data till April 20, 2025). According to a report by _Paank_, the human rights wing of the Baloch National Movement (BNM), 12 extra-judicial killings were reported across Balochistan in March. Similarly, _Paank_ reported 18 extra-judicial killings in February, and eight in January. With 51 extra-judicial killings, the cumulative figure of extra-judicial killings till April 20 in the current year is already approaching the total number of extra-judicial killing in the entirety of the previous year, at 68 cases. 75 persons were extra-judicially killed in 2023, and 195 in 2022. Extra-judicial killings are the final stage of the State’s systematic human rights abuses, which start with abduction or arbitrary arrest, followed by torture. According to the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), Balochistan has around 7,000 missing persons. However, the Pakistan Government’s Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (COIED) report claimed that there were only 454 active cases in Balochistan, as of October 2023, an assertion that created deep resentment among the Baloch people. Disappeared persons’ bodies are often dumped by the roadside, with marks of severe physical torture and riddled with bullets. This pattern of systematic abuse has been adopted by Pakistan’s security agencies and State backed ‘death squads’, to suppress the Baloch insurgency. ‘Death squads’ are locally armed militia of criminals in Balochistan who are patronized by the Army, to carry out enforced disappearances and realize the state’s ‘kill-and-dump policy’. These groups often accompany SFs during raids on the homes of political activists, dissidents and ‘pro-independence’ leaders. In exchange for their services, the SFs have given the death squads a free hand to operate throughout Balochistan, to engage in a range of illegal activities, including drug dealing, smuggling of weapons, and to run terrorist training camps and private jails, under the patronage of the intelligence agencies. Apart from Islamist and sectarian extremism-related fatalities in the province, the ‘death squads’ alnd SFs have been the main executors of unattributed extrajudicial killings in Balochistan. According to the SATP database, of the 5,073 conflict-linked civilian fatalities recorded in Balochistan since 2004 (data till April 20, 2025), at least 1,665 are attributable to one or other terrorist/insurgent outfit. Of these, 654 civilian killings (363 in the South and 291 in the North) have been claimed by Baloch separatist formations, while Islamist and sectarian extremist formations – primarily Islamic State, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi ( **[LeJ](https://satp.org/terrorist-profile/pakistan/tehreek-e-taliban-pakistan-ttp)**), Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( **[TTP](https://satp.org/terrorist-profile/pakistan/tehreek-e-taliban-pakistan-ttp)**) and Ahrar-ul-Hind (Liberators of India) – claimed responsibility for another 1,011 civilian killings, 928 in the North (mostly in and around Quetta) and 83 in the South. The remaining 3,408 civilian fatalities – 1,920 in the South and 1,488 in the North – remain 'unattributed', and are largely believed to have been the handiwork of the SFs and their death squad proxies. Shafiq-ur-Rehman Mengal formed the first death squad in Balochistan in 2008 – the Musallah Defah Tanzeem (MDT) – with the purported mission of ‘defending’ the public from pro-independence groups. Mengal had the support of the Pakistan Army, and his powerful connections helped him raise his militia. Mengal initiated a reign of terror in Balochistan, killing not only suspected nationalists but also political, non-political and tribal rivals. Mengal is also ‘credited’ with the mass graves discovered in 2014 in Tootak, a rural area 55 kilometres to the north of Khuzdar, where 169 bodies were recovered. Several other local militia groups in Balochistan were raised as death squads, including the Zakaria M. Hasni-led death squad in Khuzdar; the Deen Muhammad Deenu-led group in Awaran; another led by Samir Sabzal, Rashid Pathan and Sardar Aziz in Kech; the Maqbool Shambezi group in Panjgur and the Siraj Raisani group in Mastung. Siraj Raisani was killed on July 13, 2018, when a suicide bomber targeted a Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) political rally, killing at least 128 people and injuring more than 200 at Dringarh village in Mastung District. An investigative report by exiled Baloch journalist Taha Siddiqui published in the _South Asia Press_ on 27 April, 2021, claimed that, since 2010, the practice of using ‘death squads’ had been intensified and institutionalized, especially in the south-western parts of Balochistan where a full-fledged insurgency has been going on since the killing of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti on August 26, 2006. Cases of disappearance are not new to Balochistan, commencing during the 1973-1977 insurgency, and it continuing thereafter. The first case of disappearance was of Asad Mengal, son of the former Chief Minister of Balochistan Atta Ullah Mengal, and his friend Ahmed Kurd in 1976. After Zulfikar Ali Bhutto dissolved the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan in 1973, which provoked the insurgency, people disappeared without trace and were detained without fair trial. Protests by civil society groups and family members of the abductees against State-sponsored ‘enforced disappearances’ and extra-judicial killings are not new. In November 2023, a protest march was sparked by the death of Balaach Mola Bakhsh on November 20, 2023, in an allegedly fake encounter by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD). On December 6, 2023, hundreds of Baloch walked from Kech District in Balochistan to Islamabad, to protest the killing. On July 28, 2024, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) organised a _Baloch Raaji Muchi_ (Baloch National Gathering) against the Baloch genocide. A permanent protest camp set up by VBMP in Quetta, has been a sign of resistance for last 15 years. However, on April 17, the Police dismantled the protest camp set up by the families of political prisoners who had been arrested during the March 2025 protests under the leadership of activist Dr. Mahrang Baloch. The BYC issued a strong condemnation of the Police dismantling the peaceful protest camp set up by families of political prisoners — including Dr. Mahrang Baloch, Shahji Sibghatullah, Bebarg Baloch, Gulzadi Baloch, and Beebow Baloch — all of who remain in custody under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) ordinance. A BYC statement called the Police action “a grave display of authoritarianism.” Earlier, on March 21, 2025, a large protest was organised in front of the Balochistan University in Quetta against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings under the BYC banner, led by Mahrang Baloch. SFs used force to disperse the crowd. The protest had been triggered by the enforced disappearances of Beebagr Baloch, one of BYC’s central leaders, and his brother Dr. Hammal Baloch, on March 20, 2025. Beebagr Baloch, a wheel-chair bound activist and a key BYC leader, has been an outspoken critic of human rights violations in Balochistan, mobilising youth and organising protests, despite his physical disability. Though media reporting was curtailed, the videos surfacing on the social media depicted the Police pushing and dragging protesters into police vans, firing blank shots and using tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstrators. The protests resulted in a violent confrontation between the protesters and the Police, resulting in casualties among protesters and injuries to some Policemen. BYC claimed that three of its members were killed and another 13 were injured. Balochistan Government authorities claimed that 10 Policemen sustained injuries during the clashes. In response to this clash, Mahrang Baloch, BYC key leader, called for a province-wide shutter-down strike to protest against state brutalities and planned another sit-in protest on Sariab Road in Quetta with the bodies of the dead. Later, on March 22, 2025, a pre-dawn raid led to the arrest of Mahrang Baloch and another 16 activists, while also seizing the bodies of those killed. Despite Mahrang’s arrest, the Province saw a complete shutter-down strike on March 23, with shops closed, tyres burnt, roads and major highways closed for traffic, and the region brought to a standstill, disconnected from the rest of the world. On March 22, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) issued statements condemning the Police crackdown against protesters and the arrest of BYC leaders. They demanded the immediate release of all the detainees and called on “all political parties, including those with legitimate support in Balochistan” to “take the lead and engage with all stakeholders in the province, including civil society and academia.” However, the state remained adamant in its authoritarian approach to supressing legitimate Baloch voices. The sister of Mahrang Baloch, Nadia Baloch, during a press conference on March 26, 2015, alleged that the Pakistan Army was subjecting Dr. Mahrang Baloch to extreme torture in jail. Her family was not being allowed to meet her despite court orders and Mahrang's health had deteriorated due to unhealthy food. The judiciary in Pakistan also remains subservient to the Army. On April 15, 2025, the Balochistan High Court refused to rule on Mahrang Baloch’s detention, a decision her lawyers said would delay her case and keep her behind bars. The Balochistan High Court refused to hear an appeal against her detention, instead referring her case to the Federal Ministry of Interior. While, state security agencies have been busy orchestrating enforced disappearances under their ‘kill-and-dump policy’, the state itself has been committed to thoroughly supressing the Baloch right to protest. This systematic repression and the complete neglect of Baloch grievances can only fuel the Baloch insurgency further. | | | --- | | ![](https://www.satp.org/App_Themes/User/CountryLogo/INDIA.png) **INDIA** | [![](https://www.satp.org/Images/socialmedia/facebook.png)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-44)[![](https://www.satp.org/Images/socialmedia/twitter.png)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=SAIR-Volume 23 No.44&url=http://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-44)[![](https://www.satp.org/Images/socialmedia/linkedin.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle/?title=PAKISTAN: Balochistan: Brutality fuels insurgency | INDIA: Naxalism: End of the road &url=https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-44)[![](https://www.satp.org/Images/socialmedia/whatsapp.png)](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-44)[![](https://www.satp.org/Images/socialmedia/email.png)](https://satp.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4a75393f28202f293e776c2b273a7128252e337770223e3e3a6f790b6f780c6f780c3d3d3d64392b3e3a6425382d6f780c2b2e2723246f780c2f272b23266f780c3f3a26252b2e2f2e6f780c262f3e3e2f383964223e27)![Print](https://www.satp.org/Images/socialmedia/print.png) **_Naxalism_: End of the road** Deepak Kumar Nayak Research Associate, _Institute for Conflict Management_ On April 15, 2025, two wanted cadres of the Communist Party of India-Maoist ( **[CPI-Maoist](https://satp.org/terrorist-profile/india/communist-party-of-india-maoist-cpi-maoist-all-its-formations-and-front-organizations)**), carrying a collective bounty of INR 1.3 million, were killed in an encounter with Security Forces (SFs) in the forest of the Kilam-Bargum villages of Kondagaon District in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh. The killed Maoists have been identified as Haldar, a dreaded Maoist ‘commander’ and member of the Maoists’ east Bastar division, who carried a reward of INR 800,000, and Rame, an ‘area committee member (ACM)’, who carried a reward of INR 500,000. The bodies of the Maoists, along with one AK-47 rifle and other weapons and explosives, were recovered from the spot. On April 12, 2025, three CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with SFs on an anti-Maoist operation in a forest in the Indravati National Park area in the Bijapur District of the Bastar Division of Chhattisgarh. One of the slain Maoists was identified as Anil Punem, the Local Operations Squad (LOS) ‘commander’ and Maoist ‘area committee member (ACM)’, who carried a bounty of INR 500,000. Anil was the alleged mastermind of the killing of eight _jawans_ and the driver of the vehicle in which they were travelling, at Ambeli in Bijapur District on January 6, 2025. The identities of the other two slain Maoists are yet to be confirmed. On April 8, 2025, the Special Task Force (STF) of Bihar killed a CPI-Maoist ‘area commander’, carrying a reward of INR 100,000, during a combing operation in the forest areas near the Jharkhand border, in Kalothar Forest under Katoria Police Station limits in the Banka District of Bihar. The body of the Maoist Ramesh Tuddu _alias_ Tetua (45), in ‘uniform’, and a carbine were recovered from the spot. Tuddu was a native of the Budhi Ghat locality under the Katoria Police Station and faced over 11 criminal cases registered in Jamui and Deoghar Districts. On April 2, 2025, two women CPI-Maoist cadres, Mamta _aka_ Ramabai, who hailed from the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra, and Pramila _aka_ Mase Mandavi, from the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh, were killed in an encounter with the Police in the jungles of Mundidadar and Ganheridadar under the Bichhiya Police Station in the Mandla District of Madhya Pradesh. Along with the bodies of the slain Maoists, weapons, including Self-Loading Rifles (SLRs), and wireless sets, were recovered from the encounter spot. According to partial data collated by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), at least 161 _Naxalites_ \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] have been killed by SFs since the beginning of the current year, 2025 (data till April 20). During the corresponding period of 2024, SFs had killed 91 _Naxalites_. Through 2024, SFs killed 296 LWEs, while56 were killed in 2023. Meanwhile, SFs arrested 439 _Naxalites_ in 2024, in addition to 401 in 2023, according to partial data compiled by SATP. In the current year, as on April 20, 2025, 151 arrests had been recorded. A total of 16,862 arrests has been recorded since March 6, 2000. The mounting pressure on the Maoistshas resulted in a large number of surrenders over the past few years, with an acceleration since the declaration that the country would be free of _Naxalism_ before March 2026. According to SATP, at least 475 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2024, in addition to 268 in 2023. During the current year, as on April 20, 2025, at least 600 had already surrendered. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 17,827 LWEs have surrendered across the country. On April 18, 2025, Union Home Minister (UHM) Amit Shah, reiterating the March 2026 deadline for eradicating Naxalism from the country, asked all underground LWEs to surrender as soon as possible and join the mainstream. UHM Shah wrote on 'X'. | | | --- | | I appeal to the hiding _Naxalites_ to lay down their arms as soon as possible and join the mainstream by adopting the surrender policy of the Modi government. We are determined to free the country from the scourge of Naxalism before 31 March 2026. | It is useful to recall that, on January 21, 2024, UHM Shah asserted that the country would be freed of the menace of _Naxalism_ within the next three years, and directed states to expedite development activities in remote areas affected by the ultras. Considering the March 2026 deadline, aggressive SF dominance on the ground greatly improved the overall security situation through 2024. The trend of declining overall fatalities, on a year-on-year basis, in Left Wing Extremism-related violence, established since 2018, witnessed a marginal reversal in 2023, at around 9.62 per cent (from 135 killed in 2022 to 148 in 2023), surged enormously, by over two and a half fold (from 148 in 2023 to 397 in 2024). According to SATP data, a total of 397 fatalities (80 civilians, 21 SF personnel and 296 _Naxalites_) were killed in LWE violence through 2024, as against 148 fatalities (61 civilians, 31 SF personnel and 56 Naxalites) recorded in 2023. During the current year, as of April 20, 2025, the total number of such fatalities stood at 161 (17 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 161 Naxalites), as against 129 such fatalities (27 civilians, 11 SF personnel and 91 _Naxalites_) reported during the corresponding period of 2024. A matter of concern was the spike in the number of civilian fatalities (80) recorded through 2024, as compared to 61 in 2023, about 31.14 per cent. Nevertheless, civilian fatalities recorded in 2024 were the fourth lowest since 2018, according to SATP data. Three other previous lows were recorded at 53 in 2022, 58 in 2021 and 61 (twice) in 2020 and 2023. The maximum number of civilians killed in such violence since 2018, 108, was in 2018. The maximum number of fatalities recorded in this category since March 6, 2000, was 630, in 2010,. Meanwhile, the number of fatalities among SFs decreased from 31 in 2023 to 21 in 2024, according to SATP data, and the number of fatalities in 2024 was the second lowest in this category since 2018. A previous low of 15 was recorded in 2022. The maximum number of SFs killed in such violence, 73, was in 2018. The maximum of such fatalities since March 6, 2000, was 319 in 2009. The SF:Maoist kill ratio greatly favoured the SFs in 2024, at 1:14.09, significantly improving the ratio in favour of the SFs in 2023, when it was at 1:1.80. The 2024 ratio was the best since March 6, 2000, and surpassed the previous best of 1:4.46 in 2022. The ratio favoured the Maoists only thrice: 1:1.2 in 2007, 1:1.01 in 2009 and 1:1.007 in 2010. Since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.76). In the current year, the kill ratio remains in favour of the SFs at 1:10.73 and is the second most positive, thus far (data till April 20, 2025). Other parameters of violence also point to significant improvement in the security situation relating to LWE activities across the country. Due to aggressive SF dominance, the Maoists have hardly been able to carry out their disruptive activities. At least two major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) were carried out by the Maoists in 2024, compared to three such incidents in 2023. The Maoists orchestrated at least 42 incidents of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in 2024, compared to 62 such incidents in 2023. Further, the Maoists were involved in 12 incidents of arson in 2024, as compared to 32 such incidents in 2023. However, there were 116 incidents of exchange of fire between SFs and Maoists in 2024, compared to 89 such incidents in 2023. Through 2024, SFs recovered arms and ammunition from the Maoists on 205 occasions, in addition to 222 such recoveries in 2023. During the current year, as on April 20, 2025, the number of such recoveries stands at 68. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 5,131 occasions of arms recovery have been documented. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from 10 States in 2024, in comparison to 11 States in 2023. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 10 affected States had 35 Districts which recorded a Maoist presence, out of a total of \\_\\_ Districts in these States. Of these, two districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; nine in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 24 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2023, of 50 affected districts from 11 states, six districts fell in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 44 were ‘marginally affected’. Indeed, sharing a similar analysis on the remaining LWE-affected districts, on April 10, 2025, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) through a Press Information Bureau (PIB) release, stated that the number of LWE-affected districts had reduced from 126 to 90 in April 2018, 70 in July 2021 and further to 38 in April-2024. Of the total number of LWE-affected districts, the “most **[affected districts](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2120771&reg=3&lang=1)**” had come down from 12 to six, which include four districts from Chhattisgarh (Bijapur, Kanker, Narayanpur, and Sukma), one from Jharkhand (West Singhbhum), and one from Maharashtra (Gadchiroli). Likewise, out of the total 38 affected districts, the number of “Districts of Concern”, where additional resources needed to be intensively provided (beyond the severely affected districts), had reduced from nine to six. These six districts were: Andhra Pradesh (Alluri Sitarama Raju), Madhya Pradesh (Balaghat), Odisha (Kalahandi, Kandhamal, and Malkangiri), and Telangana (Bhadradri-Kothagudem). Due to persistent action against the Maoists, a number of “Other LWE-affected” Districts had also decreased from 17 to six. These include districts from Chhattisgarh (Dantewada, Gariabandh, and Mohla-Manpur-Ambagarh Chowki), Jharkhand (Latehar), Odisha (Nuapada), and Telangana (Mulugu). Manifestly, analysis of all LWE-affected states across the country indicated an overall declining trend in Maoist violence and activity, and a substantial improvement in the security situation in the affected regions. The annual assessments of the affected states stands testimony to the diminishing influence of the rebels in **[Andhra Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-29#assessment2)**, **[Bihar](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-38#assessment2)**, **[Chhattisgarh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-30#assessment2)**, **[Jharkhand](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-32#assessment1)**, **[Karnataka](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-41#assessment2)**, **[Kerala](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-43#assessment2)**, **[Madhya Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-37#assessment2)**, **[Maharashtra](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-35#assessment1)**, **[Odisha](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-40#assessment2)**, and **[Telangana](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-23-No-33#assessment2)**. Meanwhile, according to a January 21, 2025, report, as part of a continued offensive against the CPI-Maoist, the Central Security Forces and the State Police Forces aim to establish 88 additional security camps in LWE-affected states this year. An unnamed senior official of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) disclosed that, since 2019, a total of 290 security camps had been set up in LWE-affected states, mostly in Chhattisgarh and Odisha. In 2024, 48 such camps were established. The significance of such camps is to help the SFs in planning operations against armed Maoist cadres and to fill the security vacuum in areas of erstwhile Maoist dominance. Since 2017-18, INR 35.0329 billion has been released by UMHA under the Special Central Assistance (SCA) scheme for the 12 most LWE-affected districts. The main objective of the scheme is to fill critical gaps in public infrastructure and services in the worst LWE-affected districts. Of the 12, seven worst LWE-affected districts are in Chhattisgarh: Bastar, Bijapur, Sukma, Kanker, Narayanpur, Dantewada, and Mohalla-Manpur-Ambagarh Chowki; two districts are in Odisha: Kalahandi and Kandhamal; and one each in Jharkhand (West Singhbhum), Madhya Pradesh (Balaghat), and Maharashtra (Gadchiroli). A February 25, 2025, report revealed that around 2,500 additional security personnel had been deployed in Chhattisgarh to help encircle the rebels inside the Abujhmadh Forest, before stepping up the offensive against them. The security establishment indicated that the 2,500 additional personnel had been brought in from Odisha and Bihar. An unnamed security official attached to UMHA observed, | | | --- | | They have been deployed in the core areas of Abujhmadh forest, which was earlier considered an impregnable rebel fortress. Besides, the forces are setting up more forward bases deep inside the Maoist strongholds in the state. | As the government intensifies operations in Chhattisgarh's CPI-Maoist strongholds, the Maoists have offered conditional peace talks, though the State government responded be declaring that any talks must be unconditional. On March 28, 2025, through a press release in Telangana, the CPI-Maoist 'central committee (CC)' stated that it was ready for peace talks on the condition that the government halts its anti-Maoist operations in the region and stops the establishment of new camps of armed forces in various States, including in Chhattisgarh. The Maoist statement read, | | | --- | | We are always ready for peace talks in the interest of the public. Therefore, on this occasion, we are proposing to create a positive atmosphere for peace talks in front of the Central and State governments. | Responding to the offer, according to an April 3, 2025, report, State Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma stated that the government was ready for talks and for the Maoists to return to the mainstream, but it could not be subject to conditions laid down by the Maoists. He added that the government was not going to form any committees for peace talks and reiterated that the Maoists could initiate negotiations through any channel of their choice. Sharma stated, | | | --- | | They have written themselves that the last time they had said that they would discuss if \\[security forces\\] should not leave their camps for six months, there should be a reduction in the number of troops, the weapons should remain unused or be deposited. Back then, we had made it clear that with these conditions, there will be no talks. Talks will be without any conditions and we are still ready for that, our Central leadership is ready, Hon. \\[Chief Minister\\] Vishnu Deo Sai ji is ready, there is no problem with talks. But the government will not form any committee. They should make one if they want or use the channel they like, we are ready. | In the meantime, in view of the situation prevailing in Dandakaranya, Chhattisgarh, the CPI-Maoist, in a letter released on April 18, 2025, in the name of Rupesh, the 'spokesperson' of the party's North and West Sub-zonal Bureau, announced that they want a ceasefire from both sides for at least a month. According to the letter, Rupesh thanked Chhattisgarh Deputy Chief Minister (CM) Vijay Sharma for responding to their first statement on April 8. They stated that the ongoing massacre in the name of Operation Kagar would stop only through talks. They clarified that there was no strategy behind their first letter on the same issue, and that their colleagues need to meet the members of the 'Central Committee (CC)' and the Special Zonal Committees (SZC) to resolve the issue. They explained that they needed security assurances to meet their colleagues, along with the delegation representing them in the talks. For this, they appealed for a suspension of SF activities for a month. They added that they had already instructed their colleagues not to open fire on the armed forces during the talks, and asked the government to respond in kind, and observe a ceasefire. Despite having issued their cadres not to attack, they alleged that central forces continued to carry out encounters, adding that, if the massacre continued, no negotiations for a permanent solution could go smoothly. Responding to Rupesh's statement, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar range, Sundarraj P, declared that the government had categorically announced that the Maoists should shun violence and come forward to join the national mainstream, and further, | | | --- | | In that situation the government is always ready to accommodate and rehabilitate each and every Maoist cadre starting from central committee/polit bureau level cadres to militia level cadres. It would be in the interest of all the stakeholders if Maoists dissociate themselves from violent activities and come forward to integrate into the social mainstream. | Clearly, the Maoist movement is under tremendous pressure due to increasing SF dominance over the erstwhile rebel strongholds. However, capacity deficits continue to put an inordinate burden on the SFs, particularly the State Police Forces. According to Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) data, as on January 1, 2023, there were 233,857 vacant posts in the Police Forces of the 10 affected States, against a sanctioned strength of 1,100,919 (actual strength: 867,062). Significantly, these constituted 40.22 per cent of the 581,364 vacant posts across India. Moreover, there were 365 (18.06 per cent) vacancies against a sanctioned strength of 2,020 (actual strength: 1,655) in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) in the 10 affected States, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. Further, in the worst Maoist-afflicted State, Chhattisgarh, there were no telephones in at least 24 Police Stations, as on January 1, 2023. In Jharkhand, considered to be the second worst afflicted State, 47 Police Stations had no vehicle, 211 had no telephone, and 31 had no wireless/mobile connectivity. In Odisha, 17 Police Stations had no wireless/ mobiles. Despite the comprehensive reverses suffered by the Maoists, apprehensions refuse to die. According to a March 28, 2025, report, a CPI-Maoist handwritten letter in Telugu, found at a recent encounter site in the Abujhmarh forest in Bijapur, Chhattisgarh, claimed that the banned outfit had recruited 130 cadres from the Maad region, 80 of them minors, including children aged nine. The letter indicated that the raw recruits were undergoing training in \"guerrilla warfare, weapons handling and IED-making\". According to the Police, the document is believed to be a CPI-Maoist \"review report\" from an internal meeting, and was found after the encounter in which Maoist 'commander' Sudheer alias Sudhakar was shot dead on March 25, 2025. Sudheer carried a bounty of INR 2.5 million and was responsible for training new recruits in weapons and guerrilla tactics. Privy to the development, an unnamed senior officer of Bastar Range thus noted, | | | --- | | Earlier, teenagers were recruited into the Maoist cultural wing, called Chetna Natya Manch (CNM), and later given combat training. If the review report is to be believed, then it indicates a dangerous trend of Maoists recruiting children as 'child soldiers' for the battlefield at a tender age. It would be soldiers vs children. But we will run campaigns to stop this recruitment. | Moreover, the Maoist 'review' noted that it was a \"report on the experiences of newly recruited comrades\" and had been compiled from 'North Bureau directives and ground-level accounts' since January 2023. According to the letter, Maoist leaders conducted a gram sabha (village assembly) in the Maad region and recruited 130 cadres - 50 aged 18-22, 40 aged 14-17 and, alarmingly, 40 aged between nine and 11 years. Senior Maoists admit in the letter that the younger recruits are not yet ready for combat and are in need of \"more education and preparation\". The letter includes a detailed account of the ongoing challenges faced by the Maoist leadership, particularly the difficulty in recruiting new members. Maoist 'commanders' expressed concern about the \"growing reluctance\" among young people to join their cause and realised that future recruitment efforts might be even more challenging. The Maoists are facing severe losses in their remaining ‘havens’ across the country, particularly in their heartland, the Dandakaranya region of Chhattisgarh. The Maoist offer of ‘peace talks’ and appeal for a ceasefire for a month has been met with scepticism, in view of the past ‘failed talks’ more than 20 years ago, when Maoists had come out of the jungles to hold talks with the Andhra Pradesh government amid much fanfare. Regrettably, the talks failed, even as the Maoist exploited the ceasefire to propagate their ideology, recruit more cadres, and extend areas of influence. The Maoist leaders and cadre soon went back into the forests, and the movement saw a dramatic escalation thereafter. The past must, of course, guide the future, but it cannot be the decisive determinant of current policy. The enveloping circumstances have changed dramatically over the intervening decades, and the state would now be negotiating from a position of overwhelming dominance. India has negotiated with numerous insurgencies in multiple theatres, with positive outcomes, and there is no reason to make an exception out of the Maoists. A measure of scepticism is warranted, of course, but avenues for a negotiated settlement need also to be actively explored. | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Weekly Fatalities: Major Conflicts in South Asia** **April 14-20, 2025** | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | **Civilians** | **Security Force Personnel** | **Terrorists/Insurgents** | **NS** | **Total** | | **AFGHANISTAN** | **2** | **0** | **0** | **4** | **6** | | **INDIA** | | | Chhattisgarh | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 2 | | **INDIA (Total)** | **0** | **0** | **2** | **0** | **2** | | **PAKISTAN** | | | Balochistan | 9 | 5 | 8 | 0 | 22 | | Khyber Pakhtunkhwa | 4 | 5 | 16 | 0 | 25 | | **PAKISTAN (Total)** | **13** | **10** | **24** | **0** | **47** | | **Total (South Asia)** | **15** | **10** | **26** | **4** | **55** | | | | --- | | Provisional data compiled from English language media sources. | ![](https://www.satp.org/App_Themes/User/CountryLogo/AFGHANISTAN.png) **Afghanistan** **Taliban's status in the UN remains unchanged, says UN Spokesman:** On April 17, Stéphane Dujarric, the United Nations (UN) Spokesman, said that Russia's recent decision to suspend its ban on the Taliban was a sovereign matter for Moscow and did not alter the Taliban's standing within the UN.

[Articles](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/recent) India’s Prime Minister identifies the Maoist (or “Naxalite”) insurgency as India’s “single biggest internal security challenge.” The insurgency is today severe in scale and violence with 2,212 violent incidents in 2010 causing 1,175 casualties (713 civilian, 285 security force and 171 guerilla), a 63% increase since 2008. [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn1) Today, about 10,000 – 40,000 full-time insurgents wage a protracted peoples war to overthrow the Indian state across a vast “Red Corridor,” affecting 20 of India’s 28 states. India is currently waging a large-scale counterinsurgency campaign against the Maoists, deploying 70,000 paramilitary police in November 2009, many to the insurgent heartland in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, where 50 percent of all attacks were recorded in 2010. [\\[ii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn2) The Maoists benefit from “two Indias living side by side.” [\\[iii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn3) India is rapidly modernizing, but many inequalities are also widening – between rich and poor, town and country and upper and lower castes. Conditions for large swathes of rural India still compare with the worst of sub-Saharan Africa, and in many remote areas the state has long been absent. However, economic grievances alone do not correlate with Maoism, and in net terms, the Indian state has tremendous internal legitimacy – only 26 of India’s 100 poorest districts, and 20 of its 100 most illiterate are Maoist afflicted. [\\[iv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn4) In truth, Maoist legitimacy is restricted to the extreme end of India’s deprivation scale – amongst the adivasis (tribals) and dalits (“untouchables”) – where in addition to extreme human misery, a broader set of social and status grievances are being inflamed. Analyst Eric Randolph astutely noted on the issue that, “People can put up with a great deal of structural violence in their lives \\[…\\] particularly when it is all they have known. Instead, what tends to trigger acts of violent rebellion are specific flashpoints of injustice.” [\\[v\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn5) For the adivasis and tribals, there are plenty such flashpoints. India’s tribals – in particular the Gonds of Central India [\\[vi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn6) – are under intense assault from state and private corporate interests, and are being pushed off their forestlands by giant hydro, logging and mining projects for little compensation and rehabilitation. The dalits, already the bottom rung of landless agricultural farmers, are similarly disproportionately impacted by the tumultuous changes of modernization on the Indian countryside, and discriminated against daily despite legislation. Tribals make up the core fighting strength of the Maoist insurgency – their narrow eight percent share of the population is still sizeable given India’s 1.2 billion peoples. The Maoist insurgency follows on a long history of peasant and tribal rebellion against predatory state structures on the subcontinent. It originated in its present form in a small village in Naxalbari, West Bengal, where in 1967, villagers armed with bows and arrows resisted police and feudal landlords with bows and arrows. [\\[vii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn7) The incident galvanized the Indian Communist movement, which found a fertile audience for its Chinese-inspired Maoist rhetoric of land reform and overthrow of feudal class structures. Militant Communism has since waxed and waned for the past half century, crushed by security forces and de-legitimized by the Indo-Chinese War of 1962, but the current phase of escalation is the strongest and most violent in history. In 2004, the two largest insurgent groups – the People’s War Group and the Maoist Communist Center – merged to form the new Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI-M). The merger elevated security hardliners in insurgent command, reiterated their commitment to violent and large-scale “peoples war,” and immediately increased insurgent kinetic activity. Today, the CPI-M accounts for 90% of attacks and 95% of fatalities from “left-wing terrorism,” according to the Indian Home Ministry. [\\[viii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn8) Maoist insurgents are tactically effective and intimately familiar with their jungle terrain. They employ classic guerilla tactics, dispersing in the face of organized force and prioritize their links with the population –often through violent intimidation. Their dispersed organizational structure mitigates the risk of being decisively impacted by targeted counterinsurgent (CI) operations. Local cells have tremendous autonomy, reflected in the fact that since 2007, six of the fourteen members of the Politburo, the highest echelon of insurgent command, have been arrested, to little discernible impact in the field. [\\[ix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn9) Unusual in COIN campaigns, Maoist guerillas have the tactical advantage over Indian security forces, and have demonstrated the ability to conduct sophisticated large-scale operations. Insurgents assault training centers and police stations to capture weaponry, attack jails to break out captured comrades and target judges and state functionaries to weaken state presence. Their lethality has grown with the use of IEDs, which now result in the majority of CI casualties. Despite a total lack of external support, the Maoists have ready access to funding – territories under their control are resource-rich and the insurgents maintain an extensive and lucrative extortion network that may net them as much as 14 billion rupees ($300 million) annually. [\\[x\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn10) Part of the insurgent “tax” is explosives used in the mining sector, which companies are often in no position to refuse. [\\[xi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn11) **A Military-Centric Response** India has grown acutely aware of the Maoist threat, but the effort to date remains vastly inadequate, both in mobilizing capacity and in implementing policy. The current counterinsurgent (CI) strategy is typically Indian – manpower-intensive and enemy-centric. It emphasizes building up force numbers to “saturate” areas with government forces and prioritizes kinetic action to suffocate the insurgency by attrition. Only lip service is paid to Western-style population-centric strategy; CI forces are present to target insurgents, not secure the population. The resultant flood of ill-trained and ill-equipped soldiers conducting large-scale sweep and commando operations has exposed civilian populations to collateral damage and abuse, increased Maoist legitimacy and recruitment, and left populations open to reprisal attacks by insurgents. As such, it likely that the scale and intensity of violence will increase in the short-term, but over the longer-term, the sheer mass of government capacity may tip the balance. Even so, brute military force is unlikely to ever fully extinguish an insurgency that is driven primarily, if not exclusively, by social and status grievances. In India’s federalist structure, states assume primary responsibility for combating Maoism, but their inadequacy has forced central “paramilitary” police forces to assume the leading COIN role. “Operation Green Hunt” launched in November 2009 deployed about 70,000 Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF) personnel (split roughly evenly between combat and support staff) to reach a 2011 end-strength of 73 battalions across Maoist-affected states. [\\[xii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn12) The CRPF is India’s largest internal security force and is a resource provider of sorts for the central government – sending emergency infusions of armed police to insecure areas across the country. [\\[xiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn13) The nomenclature of “paramilitary” typically attributed to the CRPF may overestimate its true capabilities – it is nowhere close to being a specialized CI force. [\\[xiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn14) In Kashmir, some CRPF units received intensified resourcing and training allowing them to independently secure key terrain districts, [\\[xv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn15) but in net terms, the CRPF is subject to all the problems of the Indian police sector including chronic shortfalls of equipment, training, leadership, and logistical and administrative support. It struggles in basic constabulary operations – let alone open combat against a tactically proficient insurgent on home terrain. Symbolic of the challenge, some CRPF units’ still lack protective vests, even while deployed in frontline combat roles! [\\[xvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn16) For anti-Maoist operations, the CRPF is supported by other state armed police forces, i.e. those state police units trained for higher grade law and order problems, including India Reserve Battalions (IRB). These forces are more competent than the regular police, but there is generally a net decline in combat capacity, discipline and professionalism down the hierarchy of security institutions. Scale, capacity and terrain challenges severely hamper the CI force. 70,000 troops cannot by themselves realistically expect to affect any measurable difference over a population of at least 450 million people across 1.86 million square kilometers of tough, remote terrain [\\[xvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn17) – especially without adequate support from effective civil police for regular law and order functions. The UN recommends a peacetime police-to-population ratio of 222 policemen per 100,000 members of the population, which India – and especially its insurgency-affected areas – falls far short of. [\\[xviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn18) In the Maoist heartland of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, new figures show their police-to-population ratios at 226 and 206 in 2010, [\\[xix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn19) a dramatic improvement (at least on paper) from 2000, when the ratio was a mere 50! [\\[xx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn20) Other states lag far behind. Orissa remains at 136, West Bengal at 100, and Bihar at just 74. [\\[xxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn21) Numbers tell only part of the story. Indian police are notoriously corrupt and brutal by Western standards. Draconian sedition laws punish even the semblance of sympathy for the Maoist cause, [\\[xxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn22) and anti-Maoist operations regularly leave behind a trail of destruction – including serious abuses such as torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions and rape. [\\[xxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn23) In the field many units – other than some elite forces – are tactically outmatched. Maoists benefit from the guerilla’s ability to choose the time and place of engagement, allowing them to confront the state at its weakest points. Coordinated attacks have penetrated high-security areas with relative impunity, but most notable was the 2010 Maoist ambush in Dantewada that killed 76 soldiers of the 62nd CRPF Battalion, the single largest loss of life in Indian COIN history. The event deeply undercut the Indian government’s claims of progress, and revealed systemic failures. 62 Bn. had served previously in anti-Naxal operations in Bihar, but like other CRPF units was shifted in an ad hoc manner on the basis of availability rather than suitability for the mission. As a result, it failed to acclimatize to the local physical and human terrain, evident when the force found itself trapped on a narrow jungle path. An IED was able to halt the entire column by disabling the lead vehicle, and well-positioned guerillas prevented any retaliatory maneuver. [\\[xxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn24) Chronic deficiencies in leadership were also evident – not uncommon in a force that sees its best officers poached by other agencies. [\\[xxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn25) The unit commander reportedly lied about his position to avoid a long-range field patrol, and failed to report a lost radio that likely allowed guerillas to track to column over several days. [\\[xxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn26) Insurgent intelligence dominance was easily evident – the Maoists were able to maneuver 1,000 men into place without detection, no doubt benefiting from at least some local support. Dantewada was an exceptional incident, but there are a legion other equipment and training challenges that limit CI abilities. Drastic expansion in force size has come without a commensurate emphasis on building up an adequate support base. Troops are barracked in terrible living conditions and there is widespread resentment at the perceived lack of political support, as well as the lack of clarity and resources with which to conduct their missions. Force protection is low, especially against IEDs. Deployed counter-IED equipment is limited [\\[xxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn27) and current armored vehicles provide inadequate protection, forcing a reliance on vulnerable dismounted patrols. New armored vehicles are being introduced – but Maoists have generally adapted by increasing the size of their bombs. [\\[xxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn28) Unsurprisingly, morale is low. One soldier angrily declared to an embedded reporter, “Have you ever seen a war being fought like this? We don’t know if we are here to assist the state police on law and order or to flush out Naxals, or merely to oscillate between troubled territories, getting our jawans (soldiers) killed for no fault of theirs.” [\\[xxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn29) He went on to point out various shortcomings including inadequate and sporadic rations, virtually no support for injured and killed soldiers, and points out that even “when I go on leave or when I am on my way back home \\[from camp\\], I travel that distance at the mercy of God or the Naxals. What morale are you talking about?” [\\[xxx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn30) Despite their tactical capabilities, Maoists adhere to classic guerilla tactics, readily ceding territory in the face of organized state offensives, even “liberated areas” such as Lalgarh district. Their mobility and trans-bordered nature allows them to exploit weak intra-state cooperation, making border areas between states particularly troublesome. Some states such as Chhattisgarh have multiple tri-junctions – where the borders of three states meet – allowing insurgents to mount attacks across state lines before retreating to safe havens. [\\[xxxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn31) Success in one state – such as Andhra Pradesh – may only displace insurgents into others; the neighboring states of Orissa and Chhattisgarh have seen significant spikes in violence since. Several initiatives have been unveiled to overcome the jurisdictional conflicts that plague effective trans-border policing, most notably by creating unified commands in insurgency-affected states. Designed to act as ‘fusion centers’ to facilitate cooperation between states, between state and federal forces, and between civilian and military personnel, their result has so far been underwhelming, not least because of the pushback from many state and local governments. On the local level, a political-criminal interface ensures that many politicians are eager to collude with Maoists and profit from their control of mines and resources. In some states – such as Jharkhand and Bihar – political rivalries mean that states refuse to cooperate with federal efforts, and in others, leaders collude with the Maoists for self-preservation. In West Bengal, the state government has greatly slowed CI activity and all but allowed a Maoist sanctuary earning them greatly reduced levels of violence in the state, but damaging the overall COIN effort. [\\[xxxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn32) The easy availability of central forces has also resulted in many states neglecting their own police modernization efforts. Unsurprisingly, simply augmenting force numbers has not paid dividends. Chhattisgarh and Jharkand both saw insurgent attacks rise despite a police surge, whereas in Andhra Pradesh, the state which has most effectively combated Maoists, the police force in population terms remained constant. Credit for reversing insurgent momentum is generally given to the state’s elite ‘Greyhound’ force built to live and operate in the jungle as the guerilla did, and fight the Indian jungle equivalent of a “bush war.” The force’s 1,000 personnel across 30 “assault units,” benefited from rigorous training and superior equipment (particularly communications technology) and were able to rapidly deploy and effectively operate on Maoist terrain. The Greyhounds have been extremely effective, but they did not operate in a vacuum. Beyond elite forces, Andhra Pradesh pursued an effective state police capacity-building effort, spreading tactically trained personnel across the force, and building synergistic relationships between the district police, intelligence assets and the Greyhounds. [\\[xxxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn33) The state also benefited from focused efforts to improve its COIN doctrine. It coordinated police strategies, created fortified police districts in vulnerable areas, improved intelligence sharing between security agencies, [\\[xxxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn34) cross-trained regular police units with elite police commando forces, and measurably implemented well-crafted community development programs. Unfortunately through the militarized lens of India’s COIN campaign, only the warfighting elements of Andhra Pradesh’s strategy have been replicated with earnest. The CRPF is raising ten Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (COBRA) battalions to reach an envisioned end-strength of about 10,000 men. [\\[xxxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn35) COBRA battalions are expected to be some of the best-equipped paramilitary troops in the country, and are trained specifically for the Maoist fight. They are armed like a regular Army infantry platoon and are trained in counter-guerilla and jungle warfare operations at the elite Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS), the Indian Army’s premier unconventional warfare training institution. State police forces – such as the India Reserve (IR) battalions are also are tasked with raising two companies of specialized ‘commando’ forces per battalion [\\[xxxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn36) \\- and more state police forces are being given at least some advanced warfare training. This militarization of the police may yield results in terms of removing insurgents from the field, but comes with the tradeoff in diverting attention and resources away from the equally crucial task of increasing and professionalizing regular policing capacity to “hold” cleared territory. Another worrying trend has been the outsourcing of security responsibilities to auxiliary non-state militias that operate with little oversight, training or accountability, and yet are deputized under the aegis of ‘Special Police Officers’ (SPOs) with official government sanction. Most prominent was the Salwa Judum (literally translated to “Purification Hunt” in the local Gondi dialect), a Chhattisgarh government-sponsored and equipped militia of about 5,000 lightly armed tribal people. Salwa Judum may have benefited from support and funding from mining companies, and was widely accused of extreme human rights abuses including forcible displacements of villages, killings and rape. In response, in July 2011, the Indian Supreme Court declared SPOs illegal and unconstitutional and ordered their disbandment. Indian security officials had routinely justified these forces as helping them ‘localize’ their force presence, build up human intelligence networks and provide alternative employment opportunities for tribal youth. They came, however, with substantial tradeoffs including the militarization of tribal society and the emergence of ‘warlords’ who maintain control over refugee camps and swathes of territory – making disbandment and reintegration difficult. [\\[xxxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn37) However, despite their record, SPOs did provide an important “force multiplier” for culturally foreign CI forces, and their replacement with regular police will take time – by some accounts at least a year. [\\[xxxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn38) Moreover even if SPOs are abandoned fully – itself a dubious prospect – other shadowy vigilante groups also exist, including the several “Cobra” organizations in Andhra Pradesh that retaliate against Maoist violence, particularly if committed against military and government officials. [\\[xxxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn39) As detailed, Indian CI forces suffer many capacity shortfalls that impede their operational effectiveness, but major reforms are currently ongoing that could significantly increase the quality of anti-Maoist CI forces. Israeli assault rifles are being purchased, [\\[xl\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn40) helicopters being redeployed back from peacekeeping missions ostensibly for anti-Maoist operations, [\\[xli\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn41) and retired army soldiers being recruited as trainers. [\\[xlii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn42) Two of three sanctioned UAVs have been inducted to improve ISR capabilities and detect massed insurgent forces – although forested terrain restricts their utility [\\[xliii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn43) \\- and a variety of other new equipment is being inducted. All these if utilized effectively can improve the CI capacity to kill insurgents, but it is less certain that they can strategically end the insurgency. **Inadequate Social, Political and Economic Redress** The Indian state has focused on combating the insurgency by military means, but addressing the legitimate economic and social grievances of tribal peoples has been less forthcoming. Rural development in India comes with significant scale challenges, affecting 1/3rd of the entire world’s poor and traversing remote areas where the government has traditionally been absent. Improving tribal welfare is a component of the broader growth and modernization of India, and as such competes with a host of other priorities. Development projects come with sizeable time-lags that must be factored in – effective policy will require sustained funding and attention over a period of years without immediately apparent results. Development must be recognized for the offensive weapon that it is – both in attacking insurgent legitimacy and in binding tribals to the Indian state by destroying their earlier forms of social existence. [\\[xliv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn44) Moreover, it is not a panacea. Efforts to raise economic and human welfare standards must come alongside broader reforms in social justice and local governance to mitigate predatory and corrupt local administrative structures. It is not for nothing that the insurgent heartland in Chattisgarh and Jharkhand corresponds with the two worst governed states in the country. [\\[xlv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn45) Tighter regulation of private industry is also necessary, including measures to ensure rehabilitation for those displaced by mining projects, and efforts to compensate for and mitigate the ecological and social impacts of extraction. India has admittedly prioritized rural development – elevating its ministry to a cabinet level position in 2011 – and significantly increased allocations to Maoist-affected areas through targeted entitlements. However, rural development to date has been superficial and ineffective, with emphasis on increased allocations obscuring problems in implementation and a lack of progress towards desired outcomes. The Maoist Integrated Action Plan for example provided 250 million rupees in 2010, and 300 million in 2011 in discretionary funds for quick-impact human welfare projects including building facilities for drinking water, sanitation, health clinics, roads etc. Data to date, however, suggests that only a quarter of allocated money has been spent and only 15 percent of projects completed. [\\[xlvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn46) This is despite the obvious fact that sincere development is appreciated – in February 2011 the Maoist abduction of a district collector known for being an efficient and honest administrator led to tribal rallies and protests, forcing his release [\\[xlvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn47) There is, however, a prevalent belief that current patterns of insecurity dictate that stabilization must precede development. This is not an unreasonable view – it is obviously difficult to develop territory you do not control and the Maoists recognize that development can erode their control. As such, insurgents have targeted 1,241 ‘economic targets’ between 2007 and 2011, including roads, power plants, telephone towers etc. [\\[xlviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn48) Such targeting is entirely self-interested, seeking to keep communities isolated and insulated from the relief efforts and ensuring that Maoists are the sole providers of social services. Human Rights Watch for example details how Maoists shut down rural schools to create captive recruiting pools for their Bal Sangam child-brigades. [\\[xlix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn49) Government agents are prime Maoist targets, severely complicating outreach. CI forces have attempted to mitigate this problem by recently unveiling plans for seven new battalions of “specialized forces” that integrate engineering and security personnel. [\\[l\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn50) There are islands of success, but overall reconstruction and aid delivery efforts in Central India leave much to be desired. Plans look good on paper; the Saranda Action Plan for example seeks to build on successful clear operations with a series of entitlement plans – including issuing ration cards for the poor, creating rural work schemes and developing infrastructure to connect isolated communities. [\\[li\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn51) Unfortunately, many of these policies fail to be implemented effectively and a large proportion of allocated funds are leaked to inefficiency, corruption and the incompetence of the state machinery. Corruption in particular is not a side effect that can be ignored – the nexus between corrupt politicians, private industry and Maoists is a key driver of both tribal alienation from the state, as well as a major facilitator of insurgent freedom of action. Much development money is also believed to flow to Maoist hands in the form of protection money paid by reconstruction firms. **Lessons Learned** 1) Skewed priority of effort – The mission fails to integrate military and civilian efforts, and prioritizes tactical military decisions that may in many cases have strategic tradeoffs. Development and political outreach is tainted by police brutality, and ineffective military operations are a major driver of Maoist mobilization. Military missions must be designed and conducted carefully to minimize civilian alienation, and must be viewed as precursors for post-“clear” development and reconstruction. Civilian and military coordination must improve and emphasis must be placed on improving the conduct of security forces. 2) Over-Militarization of Police – The emphasis on building up paramilitary forces capable of taking the fight to the Maoists should not detract from efforts to build up competent civil police. Kinetic operations must be merely a prelude to a viable rule of law, which will require building up capacities in not just the civil police, but also the supporting justice and detention sectors. 3) Mobilize Scarce Assets – The Indian Army has rightly assessed that it is not trained or equipped to combat its own people, but it is the only Indian institution with the specialized capacity that could tip the Maoist fight. Aerial assets can improve ISR coverage, equipment such as counter-IED kits and armored vehicles can reduce police casualties, and Army trainers and facilities are the best available resource to build up small-unit combat capabilities and disseminate tactical lessons learnt from other theaters. 4) Improve unity of effort – The insurgency crosses borders, and so must the CI effort. Focus must be given to improving coordination between the many state and central agencies involved, and between states. The goal should be to create effective border management protocols that prevent insurgents from locating safe havens to regroup. 5) Attack insurgent legitimacy – CI actions should best sell their mission, but strategic communications can highlight Maoist complicity in corruption, extortion, and violent abuse at the expense of tribal communities. This is most viable if CI forces themselves adhere to tighter ethical codes of conducts than insurgents – not currently true. 6) Empower non-state actors with care – Actors such as Salwa Judum deeply de-legitimize the state and taint it by association. Especially in India, the population cannot easily distinguish between police branches or between formal and informal forces, and brutalities reinforce the predominant image of the Indian state as callous and predatory. 7) Improve the effectiveness of aid delivery – There must be a focus on outcomes over allocations. Emphasis should be paid on ensuring that projects are completed on time and to standard, and continual oversight should mitigate leakages. Projects should be visible and have immediate impact, and local communities must be involved from project design to completion. 8) Governance reform – Corruption and local predatory state structures are drivers of Maoist legitimacy and mobilization. A major facilitator of the insurgency is the willingness of local politicians to collude with Maoists and/or private industry at the expense of their constituents, and to enact self-interested policies that weaken the mission. Measures such as the sedition laws would be better suited to tackle direct support such as this, rather than human-right workers and ordinary civilians whose only crime is to extend moral support. 9) Aid is insufficient – Aid and quick-impact projects can only alleviate immediate needs. Broader economic and social reforms must be tackled with real urgency. A culture of impunity and blatant corruption must end; for politicians, police, and business elites, and inequalities between rich and poor and town and country must ease. Targeting Maoist-affected areas with increased funding and attention is probably good policy, but it is likely not an overstatement to say anti-Maoist success will correlate significantly with India’s progress in caring for its poorest peoples. * * * [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_ednref1) “Annual Report 2010-2011,” _Ministry of Home Affairs Republic Of India_, Available at [www.mha.nic.in](http://www.mha.nic.in/); “2010 bloodiest year for India’s Maoist rebellion,” _AFP,_ January 5, 2011.

    "full_text": "Since its independence in 1947, India has fought dozens of campaigns against four distinct and independent insurgencies on its soil—in Punjab, Kashmir, the Northeast, and the Maoist insurgents of central India—as well as one foreign campaign in Sri Lanka. While India has accumulated a wealth of counterinsurgency (COIN) experience that has varied in terms of terrain, insurgent goals, force structure(s), foreign involvement, and outcomes, most COIN scholars have focused on Western foreign incumbent experiences to the neglect of India and other indigenous incumbents.[1] Nevertheless, as both Iraq and Afghanistan move toward assuming greater responsibility for their internal security amidst continued insurgent activity, India’s COIN strategies can offer important lessons for these states and others that resemble its highly federalized political system, developing economy, and still evolving democracy. One analyst has argued that India has “one of the world’s most successful records in fighting insurgencies,” noting that “it has not yet lost a counterinsurgency campaign within the country.”[2] This claim, however, is puzzling given the current struggles of the Indian government to curb a raging Maoist insurgency. Today, while the insurgencies of the Northeast and Kashmir are largely contained, if not under control, and the Punjab insurgency soundly defeated, India has been earnestly testing different COIN strategies to combat a growing Maoist threat throughout its center and east known generally as the Naxalite insurgency. Since resurging in the last decade, the Naxalite uprising has been described by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as “a great national security threat” and the “biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”[3] This article will briefly describe some of the lessons of success and failure that can be drawn from India’s decades of COIN experience and their application in the current fight against the Naxalite insurgency. India’s Alternative Approach to COIN Generally speaking, the Indian take on COIN appears to depart from the approach advocated by Western doctrine that promotes a population-centric strategy to win “hearts and minds.”[4] Despite Indian official doctrine formally espousing this concept[5] and some contentions that India has always seen COIN as a “political rather than military problem,”[6] a closer look reveals that the Indian approach may be better characterized as a strategy of attrition[7] with the deployment of “raw state coercion”[8] and “enemy-centric” campaigns[9] to suffocate an insurgency through a “saturation of forces.”[10] At times it may involve the co-optation of elites to “buy-out” and contain an insurgency.[11] When the military has been deployed, it operates under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which includes “the power of the security forces to make preventative arrests, search premises without warrant, and shoot and kill civilians.”[12] In each major counterinsurgency campaign, the Indian state developed a number of innovative tactics and organizational capacities that yielded some success along with some negative fallout. During the Punjab campaign, India militarized the police and reversed their role with the military to harness local knowledge and legitimacy and lead kinetic operations.[13] As a result, the police structure remained highly militarized, bloated, inefficient, and incapable of investigative police work more than a decade later.[14] In Kashmir, the creation of a dedicated COIN force—the Rashtriya Rifles, integrating an army ethos into a paramilitary force especially equipped and trained to conduct counterinsurgency—achieved some success, but it ultimately had to be fully manned by army personnel and faced a number of operational and coordination problems with other forces.[15] The co-optation and transformation of insurgents into local assets was a tactic employed both in Punjab (called “CATs,” for Covert Apprehension Technique) and Kashmir (ikhwanis).[16] Turning insurgents was sometimes achieved through money[17] as well as abduction and torture,[18] but these tactics eventually led to new problems, such as increased criminal activity and corrupted security forces, for the respective governments.[19] Moreover, the highly kinetic approach of both campaigns entailed tremendous brutality, torture, disappearances, “encounter killings,” and mass graves that created a litany of human rights investigations and public disaffection, and today continues to fuel simmering resentment and potentially violence.[20] A slight variant of this approach—the buyout and political incorporation of insurgents—has enabled India to keep a lid on a whole host of insurgent separatist movements in the seven states of India’s eastern extremity, India’s Northeast, since 1956.[21] Yet while eliminating the prospect of separatism, it has perversely created spirals of insecurity, splinter groups (there are more than 100 distinct armed groups in the Northeast), and a dysfunctional insurgent political economy of violence, development aid, and interminable militia politics.[22] Overall, the Indian strategy of coercion, co-optation, and containment has achieved moderate success in mitigating the threat to the state, and this is being applied today against the re-emergent Naxalite insurgency. The Naxalite Insurgency The Naxalites first emerged in 1967 in the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal and spread throughout the central states of Bihar, Orissa, and Andhra Pradesh until it was violently suppressed by state and paramilitary forces by 1972. This militant left-wing movement fractured into more than 40 distinct groups, which began to remobilize, consolidate and become more active in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly in the state of Andhra Pradesh.[23] Since 2004, with the merger of the two largest factions—the Peoples War Group and the Maoist Communist Center—to form the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-M), violence has climbed dramatically, with 2,200 incidents and 1,200 killed in 2010 alone.[24] It is estimated that Naxals have a presence in one-third of districts in India,[25] but with the strongest foothold in parts of seven states—West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The difference today is that this region also happens to sit atop tremendous iron ore, coal, and aluminum deposits as well as irrigation and hydroelectric potential.[26] While some parts of the left-wing movement in India are willing to partly or fully embrace parliamentary politics to address issues of class, inequality, and distribution, the hardcore Naxalites remain unwilling to countenance democratic politics and seek the violent overthrow of the state through a variety of tactics.[27] Although conventional accounts describe them as motivated by the broad economic deprivation and absence of the state in much of rural central India,[28] a more specific reason is resentment at the local exploitative power configurations—whether feudal landlords, land-expropriating state governments, or extractive corporations—that continue to dominate and suppress the lower castes and aboriginal tribes that reside in these areas and constitute the Naxalite support base.[29] The Naxalites, however, are a protean movement that has expertly exploited a variety of caste, ethnic, or sectarian cleavages in India.[30] Unlike some of the ethno-sectarian insurgencies of recent years, the Naxalite insurgency—posturing itself as a “people’s war”—comports more with classic COIN theory that was built on notions of competitive state building to address economic and governance deficiencies.[31] In step with their historical experience, however, the Indian state has generally favored a more kinetic approach to counterinsurgency over winning “hearts and minds.”[32] There appears to be an explicit awareness that the Western COIN model may not be the right fit for India. One Indian military analyst and practitioner praised the Andhra Pradesh approach for its “enemy-centric” character, an anathema in current Western COIN discourse.[33] Another well-regarded Indian analyst defended a kinetic focus and derided the hearts and minds “myth” by recalling that even Sir Gerald Templar regarded it as “that nauseating phrase I think I invented.”[34] Moreover, a well-known defense journalist wrote that a population-centric approach “has proved to be flawed.”[35] Indian State Response to the Naxalites State Strategies Given India’s federalist structure, the onus for responding to the rising Naxalite threat has fallen upon individual states, although with substantial federal support during the past five years.[36] The hardest hit states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh—where roughly half of Naxalite activity is concentrated and continues to escalate—have raced to scale up the manpower of their state and local police forces, while being supplemented with about 40 battalions of central paramilitary forces.[37] Meanwhile, states such as Bihar and West Bengal have also seen a rise in violence in recent years as their police manpower has declined or held steady. The composition of police is another variable that may adversely affect outcomes. The police forces of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Orissa are composed of a much higher percentage of paramilitary forces (as opposed to civil police) relative to the Indian average, potentially rendering them less locally knowledgeable or legitimate.[38] Central and state governments have been criticized for their paramilitary forces’ shortfalls in size, antiquated organizational structure and age profile, inadequate training (for instance, only firing 20 rounds per year), and most importantly the absence of coordination or a coherent strategy.[39] The Limits of Indian Responses True to its past history, the Indian central and state governments’ COIN responses have been heavily kinetic, disregarding local public perceptions. One Indian commentator wrote, “exceeding Maoist rebels they accuse of brutality, the police, paramilitary and Salwa Judum recruits continue to freely kill unarmed men and women. It has wrecked any short- to medium-term hope of winning tribals and forest dwellers back to the fold of the state.”[40] With the launch of additional major sweep operations and expansion of commando units, collateral damage of civilians caught in the crossfire and through retribution is expected to rise.[41] Violence, whether premeditated or spontaneous, “can be completely indiscriminate, leading to the burning of the homes of innocents and their torture, maiming, rape, and death.”[42] While there have been centralized efforts to coordinate the use of force and economic development, these have largely faltered due to poor coordination, misutilization, and co-optation by local elites and corporations.[43] The Indian government has repeatedly set up unified commands to better coordinate the use of central paramilitary forces, state armed (paramilitary) police, and state local or civil police, but these have been riddled with problems and at times hindered local innovation.[44] A major attempt was launched with Operation Green Hunt in late 2009, a massive search-and-destroy operation meant to clear out the Naxalite strongholds in the forests of central India. The fissures of this unified command, however, were exposed when a company of central paramilitary forces short on local police support and intelligence were ambushed and more than 80 killed after being tracked for three days by Naxalite insurgents.[45] The two states that appear to be relatively successful at reducing insurgent activity or keeping it at bay are Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Maharashtra seems to have had a relatively higher police to population ratio at the beginning of the decade, potentially buffering it from the spillover of Naxalite insurgency from neighboring areas. While Andhra Pradesh’s manpower ratio rose somewhat over the past decade, its success in dramatically reducing Naxalite activity in its territory is generally attributed by Indian analysts to a rather different strategy of raising a special commando force known as the Greyhounds.[46] The Greyhound Force The Greyhound force, an elite anti-Maoist commando unit, was raised beginning in 1987 from within the Andhra Pradesh police to conduct small unit counterguerrilla offensives against Naxalite insurgents.[47] Roundly believed to have been tremendously successful, the Andhra Pradesh police have drawn inspiration from the infamous Selous Scouts of Rhodesia to prosecute the equivalent of a “bush war” against the Naxalites.[48] The 2,000-strong Greyhound force is better paid and equipped than federal or state paramilitary forces with state of the art weapons and technology, better trained in jungle warfare, and moves in nimbler, highly capable units to target, track, and destroy insurgent networks by modeling guerrilla tactics.[49] The Greyhounds are also well supported by the entire state police force.[50] Two companies of Greyhounds would be deployed at a joint operational base with two platoons of local home guards for intelligence and logistical support.[51] Between 2005 and 2008, they have been credited with bringing down the Maoist cadre in Andhra Pradesh from 1,200 to 500 and Naxalite activity in the state this decade has dropped from a peak of roughly 600 attacks in 2003 to around 100 in 2010.[52] Their success was attributed to signals intelligence exploitation, careful operational planning, jungle survival training, night operations, and decapitation of Maoist leadership.[53] The Greyhound model is perceived to be so successful that many states are starting to develop their own small unit commando police battalions. While the Indian central government continues to pour central paramilitary forces into the region (now on the order of about 70 battalions), it is also raising 10 Commando Battalions for Resolute Action (CoBRA) and deploying them alongside state and federal units.[54] Yet one should be leery of the triumphant claims made of Andhra Pradesh as well as the potential to model the Greyhound success. First, there is reason to believe that the Greyhounds did not defeat the Maoist insurgents outright but merely displaced them to neighboring states. This corresponds with data that shows Naxalite activity skyrocketed in neighboring Chhattisgarh as it declined in Andhra Pradesh.[55] Second, intelligence officers and other analysts believe gains in Andhra Pradesh are unsustainable and the state remains highly vulnerable to Maoist activity.[56] This fear was validated by a recent Times of India-IMMRB survey of five northern districts of Andhra Pradesh recently cleared of Maoist insurgents where the majority of those surveyed still sympathized with Naxalite motives, methods, and results, and viewed actions by state forces such as encounter killings as suspect and unjustified. Meanwhile, a plurality believed nothing had improved and exploitation had increased since their departure.[57] Even if the Naxalite presence and violence has been structurally reduced, the survey revealed that the strategy has certainly not relied upon winning hearts and minds to achieve this end. Finally, even if the Greyhound approach was actually successful, the background conditions required to achieve operational effectiveness are currently absent or underdeveloped in the rest of the country. Andhra Pradesh began raising the Greyhounds in 1987 but did not achieve marked success until almost two decades later. Despite the state having a relatively efficient policing system, both the Greyhound commandos and the state police and security force serving as the logistical and intelligence “tail” took substantial time to mature.[58] New police inductees served first in the Greyhound support unit for about four years before rotating to the district level where they might continue to support operations.[59] This gradually built up inter-organizational familiarity and cooperation within the state, and the substantial network of well-trained local police—features noticeably absent in the rest of Naxal-affected India—were able to funnel high quality intelligence for Greyhound targeting.[60] Conclusion Three points are worth noting about Indian counterinsurgency strategy. First, rather than abiding by a singular formula, strategies have varied over time and space depending on the context and nature of the insurgency. Second, India has routinely departed from the traditional “hearts and minds” or population-centric COIN for a highly kinetic and coercive enemy-centric COIN. Third, Indian successes are never “clean” and always involve uncomfortable tradeoffs, whether by way of criminal activity, organizational dysfunction and corruption, or further insurgency. These should all be expected as India faces down the Naxalite insurgency over what might be a full decade or more.[61] This third point is in part related to India’s democratic character. The mobilization capacity of insurgents creates perverse interests by political parties to harness these assets for their own ends.[62] In fact, for much of the earlier part of this decade, most Naxal-affected states “abdicated their authority over vast regions, as long as the semblance of normalcy could be maintained and the electoral interests of the dominant political party could be taken care of.”[63] Moreover, Indian counterinsurgency has been and will likely continue to look both brutal and incomplete (by Western standards) because the incumbent is unwilling to countenance the types of institutional overhauls needed to fully quell insurgent impulses. If the fundamental conflict is not over the distribution of resources that can be mended with economic development, but rather the distribution of power controlled by the state and elite cadres, then the disease is the system.[64] The cure then may deeply threaten not only India’s growth engine that has relied upon land appropriation and displacement for industrialization and mining, but also the power, composition, and identity of the Indian state stretching from the local level up to the state and national governments.

[25] Rahul Bedi estimates that Naxals have a presence in 20 of India’s 29 states, or 223 of 603 administrative districts, roughly one-third of the country.

Achuthan, “Tackling Maoists: The Andhra Paradigm,” Indian Defence Review 25:2 (2010). [27] Naxalite insurgents have targeted “class enemies” (sometimes through beheadings), police and security forces, infrastructure such as police stations, schools, local government buildings, roads, power lines, railways, and economic targets like mining and energy infrastructure. They have been able to carry out these activities through the acquisition as well as indigenous production of a wide variety of weapons including automatic firearms, rocket launchers, and a whole host of mines for which they use to conduct IED attacks and small unit ambushes. See Ramana; Achuthan; Sudeep Chakravarti, “No End in Sight,” Seminar 605 (2010). The Naxalites are also reported to provide public goods to local residents such as security, swift justice in “people’s courts,” education, irrigation, community kitchens, medical units, and minimum wage enforcement in part through extortion and taxation of local government offices, contractors, businessmen, and industrialists. See Bedi; Oetken; Chakravarti; Pratul Ahuja and Rajat Ganguly, “The Fire Within: Naxalite Insurgency Violence in India,” Small Wars and Insurgencies 18:2 (2007). [28] For example, the Ministry of Home Affairs Annual Report from 2006-07 states, “Naxalites typically operate in a vacuum created by inadequacy of administrative and political institutions, espouse local demands and take advantage of the prevalent disaffection, perceived injustice among the underprivileged and remote segments of population.” Also see “India’s Naxalites: A Spectre Haunting India,” Economist, August 17, 2006; Vani K.

    "full_text": "Even as India and China find themselves **[embroiled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/world/asia/india-china-border.html)** in yet another border standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), **[commentators](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/pakistan-factor-india-china-standoff-161021)** have sounded alarm on how Pakistan could seek to utilize the situation. Concurrently, **[some have observed](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/09/china-india-border-united-states-pakistan/)** that China’s transgression at the border is likely to push New Delhi closer to Washington, at a time when Sino-U.S. tensions are running high. A dyadic understanding of the security environment in Southern Asia, either through an India-Pakistan or India-China lens, is thus incomplete and does not account for the triangular dynamics that shape these interactions. To understand regional dynamics, it is critical to understand the India-Pakistan-China triangle and how it is impacted by the strategic chain, including the United States. The contemporary reality of these dynamics is grounded in an early Cold War history, and potential conflict scenarios involving these countries animate the geopolitics of Southern Asia. **A Triangle Made in History** The India-Pakistan-China triangle is mired in a convoluted history of unresolved border disputes, with military confrontations between India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and India and Pakistan at the Line of Control (LoC) occurring intermittently. In 1947, Britain’s hasty withdrawal from the subcontinent as a result of post-war decolonization led to a haphazard redrawing of political boundaries in Southern Asia, leaving some territory contested. The four wars that India and Pakistan have fought since 1947, the Sino-Indian Border War of 1962, and recurrent India-China and India-Pakistan conflicts at the LAC and LoC trace their genesis back to this protracted history. The military dimension of this triangle evolved in the years after the 1962 Sino-Indian Border War, when Beijing and Islamabad signed the **[border delimitation agreement in 1963](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dXzxLcF92cEC&pg=PA210&dq=China-Pakistan+border+delimitation+agreement+estranged+democracies&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjDydvUnNjpAhWCfH0KHQmRDKUQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=China-Pakistan%20border%20delimitation%20agreement%20estranged%20democracies&f=false)**. As part of this agreement, Pakistan handed over the Trans-Karakoram tract, a territory in Kashmir that India claimed, to China, turning the dispute into **[a trilateral one](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10357716408444182?journalCode=caji19)**. Further, during the **[1965 India-Pakistan War](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DXY8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false),** Pakistan felt betrayed by a lack of U.S. support, and chose to strengthen relations with China. Pakistan **[had expected](https://www.amazon.com/Wages-Globalism-Lyndon-Johnson-American/dp/0195113772)** the United States to tilt to its side, due to the 1954 U.S.-Pakistan mutual defense agreement and Pakistan’s membership in U.S. engineered alliances like the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization. However, during and after the 1962 war, the United States showed hitherto unseen willingness to aid and assist India’s military against Communist China, **[making it prudent](https://www.amazon.in/JFKs-Forgotten-Crisis-Tibet-Sino-Indian/dp/935177788X)** for China and Pakistan to join hands. Although Washington premised arming both Pakistan and India to achieve its Cold War objective to contain communism in Asia, neither side bought Washington’s assurances that its military supplies were not meant to be used against each other. Although China did not provide any direct military help to its new friend Pakistan during the 1965 war, it did engage in a **[psychological assault](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zcylFXH9_z8C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)** against India, repeatedly accusing New Delhi of showing aggression on the India-China border, and threatening Chinese reprisal. During and after the 1971 India-Pakistan War, the United States tilted towards Pakistan, because it needed Islamabad as a conduit to Beijing during the 1972 Sino-U.S. rapprochement talks. Beginning in 1979, Pakistan played a frontline role for the United States in Afghanistan, in the last Cold War tussle between the United States and Soviet Union. In this context, **[geopolitics trumped nonproliferation concerns](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Live-Bomb-Pakistan-1998-2016/dp/0199404569)** as Washington ignored intelligence that China was helping Pakistan develop a nuclear bomb. These conditions were hardly conducive for a healthy Indo-U.S. relationship, despite efforts at finding convergent points during the Reagan presidency. After the Cold War, the subsequent rise of China as a global power, followed by that of India, shifted dynamics of the India-China dyad, leading to heightened Sino-Indian competition, and tightening Sino-Pakistan military ties. Meanwhile, the India-Pakistan relationship remained volatile, taking an even more sinister turn as **[cross-border terrorism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4413952?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)** emanating in Pakistan targeted India, becoming a lingering roadblock to normalizing ties. **The Triangle in Contemporary Times** What characterizes this triangle is the geographical proximity of the three nuclear-armed countries, wherein any military standoff or confrontation is perceived as having the risk of use of nuclear weapons, or the probability of a two-front war for India, against a Sino-Pakistani combined military assault. Today, both **[capabilities and intentions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2538540?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)** play a significant role in shaping **[perceptions and misperceptions](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Perception_and_Misperception_in_Internat.html?id=qqAIuHgi2hoC&redir_esc=y)** within the India-Pakistan-China triangle. Specifically, Pakistan’s power asymmetry relative to that of India, and India’s power gap vis-à-vis China drive each state’s regional posture. Pakistan’s bid to enhance its capabilities, especially through nuclear deterrence and **[with Chinese assistance](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01495933.2013.821850)**, is a means to counter India’s conventional superiority. Meanwhile, China’s growing military capabilities and defense modernization as well as **[its increasing role](https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/growing-chinese-influence-south-asia)** as a development and security partner for not only Pakistan but also a host of other states in India’s neighborhood foment concern in New Delhi. Additionally, what characterizes this triangle is also the **[geographical proximity](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=02XxBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=India-China-Pakistan+nuclear+deterrence+and+geographical+proximity&source=bl&ots=Q4wFzhRuUe&sig=ACfU3U2oCZjw3dBhPI8LJeByW_pisUDVmw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwig59mAltjpAhVEgOYKHVz1CO4Q6AEwCHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=India-China-Pakistan%20nuclear%20deterrence%20and%20geographical%20proximity&f=false)** of the three nuclear-armed countries, wherein any military standoff or confrontation is perceived as having the risk of use of nuclear weapons, or the probability of a two-front war for India, against a Sino-Pakistani combined military assault. However, the Pakistani response to any India-China border confrontation, and a Chinese response to an India-Pakistan war or a military standoff at the borders, is **[more tacit than overt](https://theasiadialogue.com/2017/10/19/the-india-china-pakistan-triangle-strategic-ebbs-and-flows/)**, since the China-Pakistan strategic alliance does not have any unambiguous notion of the two countries coming to each other’s help in the event of a war. **More than a Triangle: The Strategic Chain** Strategic analysts **[increasingly agree](https://carnegieendowment.org/2013/08/05/strategic-triangle-pub-52584)** that the security dynamics of Southern Asia are best explained as a triangle, rather than as an India-Pakistan dyad. However, external players are crucial in shaping outcomes within this triangle, and so regional dynamics may be better depicted as a **[strategic chain](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/acnpi_201703_strategic_chain.pdf)** wherein the United States is the most prominent external agent of influence. The triangle and the strategic chain, as conceptual lenses to understand geopolitics in Southern Asia, are complementary rather than contradictory. While the **[inherent security dilemma](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/acnpi_201703_strategic_chain.pdf)** in the India-Pakistan-China triangle continues to be a major determining factor of the regional security scenario, looking at how the U.S. role complicates responses and counter-responses in this triangle, completes the picture. The emerging security environment in the region can be better explained by considering the concerns regarding China’s rise that drive the Indo-U.S. relationship, China and Pakistan’s threat perceptions vis-à-vis this partnership, and India’s worries emanating from the China-Pakistan alliance. As Chinese influence increases in India’s maritime and continental neighborhood, New Delhi has in turn **[reached out](https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/india-act-east-policy-is-becoming-act-indo-pacific/389502/)** to China’s neighbors to build partnerships with countries in Southeast and East Asia. Rising Sino-Indian competition in both continental and maritime realms, along with the global power tussle between China and the United States, has led to a **[greater strategic embrace](https://mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/32421/Joint_Statement_Vision_and_Principles_for_IndiaUS_Comprehensive_Global_Strategic_Partnership)** between New Delhi and Washington. Beijing, on the one hand, **[tries to convince](https://warontherocks.com/2020/03/chinas-strategic-assessment-of-india/)** New Delhi not to fully align with the United States against China, engaging India in a number of forums such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, Russia, South Africa (BRICS), Russia-India-China (RIC), Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and through bilateral top leadership **[summits](https://jamestown.org/program/india-china-relations-from-the-wuhan-spirit-to-the-chennai-connect/).** On the other hand, Beijing solidifies its strategic outreach to Pakistan, which inherently isolates India, through **[controversial projects](https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/inclusion-of-cpec-under-obor-shows-lack-of-appreciation-of-india-s-concerns-on-sovereignty-119062601263_1.html)** like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The interlocking threat perceptions and responses in the triangle hence cannot be decoupled from the U.S. strategy in the region, making the strategic chain an effective complement to explain the geopolitics of Southern Asia. **Conflict Scenarios** The regional postures of China, India, and Pakistan and the U.S. strategy in Southern Asia intend to maximize interest by capability enhancement, either through internal or external balancing. This makes the security dilemma in the region more acute and creates the possibility of conflict, some scenarios of which are explored below. _Two-front war_ Since India’s border disputes with China and Pakistan are still unresolved and Beijing and Islamabad have a close strategic and military partnership, India perceives any conflagration with either Pakistan or China as raising the specter of a two-front war. The Indian military establishment is overt in asserting its recognition of and readiness to face such an eventuality. For example, General Bipin Rawat, currently India’s Chief of Defense Staff, while serving as the Indian Army Chief, **[commented](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/two-front-war-is-a-real-scenario-says-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/56324336.cms)**, “The two-front is a real scenario. Much has changed from before in terms of our capabilities…The Army, Navy and IAF are now jointly very much prepared for such an eventuality.” India’s military preparedness for a two-front war involves developing its overall deterrent capability and credibility, advances in terms of acquisition and production of military equipment, recalibrating its military strategy, relevant training efforts to meet exigencies, and border infrastructure development. Infrastructure building in the border areas and the issue of terrain advantage has been a [**major source of contention**](https://theprint.in/opinion/china-believes-india-wants-aksai-chin-back-thats-why-it-has-crossed-lac-in-ladakh/430899/), particularly, as seen in the current clashes between Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh, or in the earlier Doklam standoff. While the Indian military establishment understandably **[projects its readiness](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/two-front-war-is-a-real-scenario-says-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/56324336.cms?from=mdr)**, others **[are more skeptical](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-sobering-arithmetic-of-a-two-front-war/)**. The case of Pakistan taking the opportunity of an India-China conflict and opening a second front at the LoC **[is seen as most probable](https://theprint.in/opinion/india-has-a-bigger-worry-than-lac-china-now-expanding-military-footprint-in-indian-ocean/439934/)**. Other scenarios include China opening a second front at the LAC or in the **[Indian Ocean region](https://theprint.in/opinion/india-has-a-bigger-worry-than-lac-china-now-expanding-military-footprint-in-indian-ocean/439934/)** in the event of an India-Pakistan conflict, or a more sinister case of a pre-planned China-Pakistan military assault against India. Indian Army Chief M M Naravane said earlier this year, “\\[…\\]Though it can take place at any level, Siachen and Shaksgam Valley are the places where territory of these two countries meet. Threat of collusivity is maximum in the strategically important glacier which forces us to keep our possession.” Talking about identifying a primary and secondary front in such a scenario, **[he added](https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/01/11/how-will-india-handle-a-two-front-war-army-chief-general-naravane-explains.html)**, “For years, we have been focusing on western border on the basis of threats. Now, we have to rebalance our deployment towards northern sector.” Irrespective of how probable such a scenario is, the perception of such a threat is likely to dictate both the reality and signalling of India’s military preparedness. _Friction in the Strategic Chain_ The India-Pakistan-China triangle is determined by relative national power and mutual threat perceptions, further complicated by the regional implications of the growing confrontation between the United States and China. Pakistan remains the most steadfast ally of China in India’s neighborhood, while India remains the only country in the region that comes closest to competing with growing Chinese influence. Stress in the strategic chain may act as a contributing factor to conflict in the region. The potential for the India-China-Pakistan-United States strategic chain to complicate matters in Southern Asia can be seen in the case of India’s candidacy for Nuclear Suppliers Group membership. **[Washington supports](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/donald-trump-administration-urges-nsg-members-to-support-indias-application/articleshow/59796299.cms?from=mdr)** India’s bid while the **[Chinese oppose it](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/china-says-no-change-in-its-stand-on-indias-membership-to-nsg/articleshow/61964228.cms?from=mdr)**, citing India’s refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and equating India’s candidature to that of Pakistan. Moreover, Beijing **[has been resistant](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/why-china-changed-its-stand-on-masood-azhar/article27211058.ece)** to supporting international efforts to list Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist at the United Nations Security Council, and **[withdrew](https://www.axios.com/china-backs-terror-designation-for-masood-azhar-in-win-for-india-8af16a49-d93e-4632-a5c2-060f0831ee00.html)** their technical hold only last year. Additionally, Afghan security in the midst of American withdrawal is another issue impacting this strategic chain: China’s **[politico-economic role in Afghanistan](https://warontherocks.com/2020/04/chinas-strategic-assessment-of-afghanistan/)** passes through Pakistan. Islamabad has **[been instrumental in bringing](https://www.ft.com/content/66b0906a-993d-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d)** the Chinese establishment closer to the Taliban, as China hopes to checkmate links between Uighur separatists in Xinjiang Province and militants in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Such developments are significant from New Delhi’s view, as it needs to become **[more pragmatic](https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/does-india-have-a-new-playbook-for-a-new-afghanistan/)** to deal with all forces that are central to the future of Afghanistan. This should include talking to the Taliban, to secure its interest in Afghanistan, in the event of an American withdrawal, the return of the Taliban as a political force and Pakistan’s intention to undercut Indian influence. These frictions in the strategic chain exacerbate the inherent tensions in the India-Pakistan-China triad, making differences more intractable and protracted. **Conclusion** The India-Pakistan-China triangle is determined by relative national power and mutual threat perceptions, further complicated by the regional implications of the growing confrontation between the United States and China. Pakistan remains the most steadfast ally of China in India’s neighborhood, while India remains the only country in the region that comes closest to competing with growing Chinese influence. The power asymmetry between India and Pakistan in the former’s favor, and the **[growing power imbalance](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-china-ladakh-lac-border-dispute-c-raja-mohan-6449294/)** between India and China in the latter’s favor will continue to reinforce the inherent security dilemma of the triangle, justifying China-Pakistan collusion, in order to checkmate India’s rise in the region. Moreover, Chinese perceptions of a U.S. containment strategy that involves India additionally impacts the triangle. The broad mistrust and zero-sum perceptions in the triangle will continue to determine the probability of crises and conflict playing out at the LAC and LoC. Besides the more volatile responses and counter-responses over the disputed borders, differences will simmer at global forums over issues such as counterterrorism and nonproliferation, and over the regional security situation in Afghanistan. Despite attempts at diplomatic maneuvers and confidence building measures to arrest uncontrolled escalation and inadvertent conflict in the triangle, the complex dynamics of the India-Pakistan-China triangle, further reinforced by the role of the United States in the region, make conflict a regular phenomenon that has to be managed, rather than eliminated.

It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. Picture source: Depositphotos. _Prospects & Perspectives No. 28_ **The Shadow War: How the Pahalgam Terror Attack Redefined India-China-Pakistan Equation** By _Jagannath Panda_ The Pahalgam [terror attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl) of April 2025, executed by the Pakistan-backed group [The Resistance Front](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473) (TRF), was not merely another episode in the long-running saga of India-Pakistan hostility. It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. By and large, India’s reaction was strong, swift, and assertive beyond the border against the terrorist outfits harbored in Pakistan. The launch of [Operation Sindoor](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473), a precise military response targeting terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC), marked a defining evolution in India’s deterrence doctrine, pointing to a zero-tolerance strategy against terrorism. More than a tactical strike, it was a message — India will respond with resolve, not restraint, when its civilians are attacked. The operation drew clear parallels with the Balakot airstrikes of 2019, yet the context had shifted. The regional climate in 2025 is far more combustible, with trilateral tensions simmering in the Himalayas. The Pahalgam incident has exposed deep-seated fractures in the regional power matrix. China’s strategic posture in the aftermath — marked by conspicuous silence, selective language, and diplomatic hedging — underscores a growing contradiction between its self-styled image as a responsible global power and its operational behavior in South Asia. By refusing to acknowledge the terrorist dimension of such attacks or to pressure its close partner, Pakistan, Beijing reveals a troubling unwillingness to act as a genuine stabilizing force in the region. The contradictions in its stand are only growing and becoming more transparent to the world by the day. Is China truly committed to regional peace and stability, or is it bound by time-worn strategic alignments that prioritize geopolitical advantage over normative responsibility? Can a power that positions itself as an architect of global order afford to undermine its credibility by shielding a state associated with cross-border terrorism? What should be India’s strategic response to this shadow war? **Beijing’s Balancing Act: Neutrality or Strategic Collusion?** Following India’s retaliation, the world watched closely for diplomatic fallout. China’s response was a masterclass in studied ambiguity. Beijing termed India’s military action “ [regrettable](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202505/t20250507_11616523.html)” while conspicuously omitting any condemnation of the terror attack itself. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made [no mention](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/lxjzh/202505/t20250509_11618305.html) of the victims in Pahalgam, nor TRF’s Pakistani connections. Instead, Beijing’s focus remained firmly on urging “restraint” and “dialogue,” echoing a playbook that has often shielded Islamabad from international censure. This is not entirely a new behavior on the part of the Chinese leadership. Beijing has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the UN Security Council to [block designations of known terrorists](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slams-china-at-un-for-blocking-move-to-designate-2611-accused-sajid-mir-as-global-terrorist/article66993043.ece) based in Pakistan, including Sajid Mir, a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander involved in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008. This pattern of diplomatic protection underscores China’s strategic calculus: Pakistan is more than an ally — it is a linchpin in Beijing’s South Asia strategy and a buffer against Indian regional ascendency. What makes China’s stance especially problematic is its persistent refusal to differentiate between India’s counterterrorism actions and aggressive behavior. Chinese state media and official discourse frequently conflate Indian responses along the LoC with assertive conduct along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), crafting a narrative in which India is portrayed as a regional aggressor. This distortion allows Beijing to simultaneously align with Pakistan’s security outlook while maintaining a superficial neutrality. Moreover, China’s behavior mirrors its broader geopolitical approach: internal threats such as “Uyghur separatism” are met with uncompromising state violence, while external threats that affect neighbors like India are compartmentalized or ignored. The selective outrage is a window into Beijing’s dual standards on terrorism and state sovereignty. **Proxy Wars and Silent Partners: Redrawing the Diplomatic Map** Beyond the rhetoric, Beijing’s alignment with Pakistan is rooted in hard interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the crown jewel of Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This infrastructure project is not just about roads and pipelines — it’s about strategic depth. Any Indian challenge to the territorial status quo threatens both Pakistan’s and China’s investments, thereby sealing the logic of Beijing’s indirect complicity. This complicity extends into the diplomatic arena. In multilateral forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China has consistently [blocked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/human-rights-must-be-respected-india-after-skipping-xinjiang-vote/articleshow/94713915.cms) Indian attempts to highlight Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism. Instead, China promotes counterterrorism frameworks that align neatly with its own domestic narratives, especially those concerning Xinjiang, while conveniently avoiding issues that implicate Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues its [strategic silence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/22/asia/imran-khan-xinjiang-axios-intl-hnk) on China’s repression of Uyghur Muslims, despite its self-styled image as a champion of the Islamic world. This tacit exchange of blind spots — on terrorism and human rights — has become the bedrock of the Sino-Pakistani axis. And India, despite walking a tightrope on sensitive Chinese issues like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, has received no reciprocation in the form of diplomatic neutrality or support. The geopolitical geometry is clear: while India and Pakistan battle over borders and ideology, China plays the dual role of facilitator and firewall for Islamabad. Whether in backchannel diplomacy or in global institutions, China consistently acts to dilute pressure on Pakistan, reinforcing a strategic triangle that disadvantages New Delhi at every turn. Beijing’s deliberate omission of Pakistani provocations and cross-border violence in its Operation Sindoor response press briefings suggests a calculated strategic posture. This silence reflects China’s continued alignment with Pakistan, indicating that broader geopolitical considerations outweigh any immediate concerns about regional instability. By not publicly addressing Islamabad’s role, China signals its intent to preserve and prioritize its long-standing strategic partnership with Pakistan. **A Call for India’s Strategic Realignment** In this increasingly tangled web of interests, India must reassess its China doctrine. The idea of Beijing as a potential stabilizer in South Asia has little basis in reality. Instead, China has shown a consistent willingness to prioritize its strategic partnerships and investments over regional peace or normative alignment against terrorism. One avenue for India is to adopt a strategy of normative reciprocity. If China insists on referring to Jammu and Kashmir as a “disputed territory,” India could begin more openly addressing Chinese sensitive issues, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and potentially even Taiwan, revisiting its “One China” policy. Until now, India has largely upheld a principle of “mutual sensitivity” regarding core sovereignty concerns. While China has been increasingly assertive in internationalizing the Kashmir issue — whether through UN Security Council interventions, statements aligning with Pakistan, or selective cartographic provocations — India has avoided reciprocal commentary on China’s sensitive regions. This asymmetric restraint has allowed China to shape narratives unchallenged, while denying India the same deference on issues central to its national unity. Engaging Taiwan more openly — especially on trade, technology, and democratic solidarity — aligns India with other democracies like the U.S., Japan, and parts of Europe that have gradually normalized unofficial ties. Strengthening ties with Taiwan also offers India access to high-end manufacturing, especially in semiconductors, where Taiwan’s TSMC dominates global supply chains, critical for India’s tech and defense sectors. A closer India-Taiwan dynamic could be used as part of a broader Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance Chinese assertiveness in the region, especially when coupled with defense dialogues like the Quad. Explicit moves on Taiwan would likely provoke strong diplomatic and possibly economic retaliation from Beijing. This could take the form of border pressure along the LAC, trade restrictions, or cyber disruptions. Any move on Taiwan would have more impact if coordinated with partners like the U.S., Japan, or Australia. A unilateral shift may yield limited strategic gain while exposing India to disproportionate costs. It is therefore imperative that India must continue to invest more robustly in multilateral and minilateral coalitions that exclude or counterbalance China, such as the Quad, the India-Japan-Australia trilateral, and enhanced EU engagements. India’s aspiration to be recognized as a major international power, including in the “Global South,” depends not solely on its material capabilities but also on its normative influence, particularly in shaping global discourses on terrorism. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, New Delhi may need to recalibrate its approach by intensifying collaboration with global norm entrepreneurs, including middle powers across Europe and Asia, as well as transnational civil society and multilateral institutions. Moreover, India’s leadership roles in forums such as the G20 and BRICS present strategic platforms through which it can reframe regional security narratives and assert its vision for counterterrorism norms. Domestically, India must prepare for the long haul. The possibility of a coordinated two-front scenario — with Pakistan engaging in asymmetric warfare through proxy actors and irregular tactics and China providing strategic and diplomatic cover — is no longer hypothetical. Preparing for this evolving threat environment requires India to adopt a comprehensive and long-term security posture, encompassing military modernization, institutional resilience, and societal preparedness. Enhancing border infrastructure, upgrading intelligence and surveillance capabilities, and fortifying strategic deterrence must be non-negotiables in India’s defense roadmap. Sustaining a prolonged state of readiness requires a resilient defense-industrial base, robust supply chains, and financial planning. India must continue reforms to reduce dependence on foreign arms imports, incentivize indigenous R&D, and create strategic reserves for critical materials. Further, building robust logistical networks, especially in border states and high-altitude regions, will improve troop mobility and sustain long-term deployments. Civil-military synergy in infrastructure projects such as roads, airfields, and telecommunications along both western and eastern frontiers is essential. The shifting threat landscape demands that India move beyond reactive postures. Both Pakistan and China are adept at leveraging information warfare and disinformation to influence public opinion and sow discord. India must invest in counter-disinformation capacities, strategic communication, and public awareness campaigns to build regional and societal resilience against foreign psychological operations, where Taiwan could emerge as a stronger partner. New Delhi must significantly enhance its capabilities in narrative warfare — a strategic effort to shape perceptions, control the discourse, and influence international opinion. This involves not only countering adversarial narratives but also proactively framing its own story in a manner that resonates with global audiences. India’s case against Pakistan-based terrorism, as well as China’s tacit support through diplomatic silence or selective framing, must be articulated with clarity, credibility, and moral authority. To be effective, this narrative must be disseminated across multiple global platforms — from the United Nations and international media to think tanks, academic forums, and digital diplomacy channels — to expose the regional destabilizing roles of both Pakistan and China, and to align international sentiment with India’s security concerns and normative positions. The decision to send [delegations](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seven-all-party-delegations-to-take-indias-message-against-terrorism-to-key-partner-nations-government/article69586448.ece) to 32 nations is a strong first step. Publishing credible evidence, such as satellite imagery, financial trail disclosures, or intercepted communications, can further strengthen the factual basis of India’s narrative and pre-empt counterclaims. **Conclusion: Pahalgam as a Turning Point** The Pahalgam terrorist attack will be remembered not just for its human toll, but for what it revealed about the shifting tectonics of regional power complexities. It was a moment of clarity: India is not just facing a belligerent neighbor in Pakistan, but also contending with a cunning and double-standard power in China that is willing to obscure terrorism behind the veil of strategic self-interest. Increasingly, China’s actions — or calculated inactions — are rendering its strategic contradictions more visible to the international community, challenging the coherence of its South Asia policy and weakening its claim to impartiality in regional conflict resolution. The path ahead for India requires more than conventional military readiness; it calls for a fundamental reassessment of the strategic assumptions underpinning India's approach to China, particularly regarding Beijing’s role in shaping, enabling, or deferring regional crises. New Delhi’s challenge is two-fold. It must deter asymmetric threats from across the border, and it must decode and counteract the quieter, more insidious enablers of that threat. That means not just stronger borders, but sharper diplomacy. Not just better arms, but better arguments. Narrative warfare, if conducted strategically, allows India not just to defend its position but to shape the global agenda on terrorism and regional order, reinforcing its claim to normative leadership as a rising power. Pahalgam may have been a tragedy for India, but it is also an inflection point. A new foreign policy realism must follow. Because in this geopolitical theatre, the shadows are as dangerous as the swords.

New Delhi has sent 50,000 additional troops to the Himalayan areas of the undemarcated Line of Actual Control (LAC), according to recent Indian media reports. French-made Rafale fighter jets armed with long-range missiles will support soldiers on the ground in Ladakh, who are equipped with 105mm field guns and M777 howitzers. The M777s can be moved from one sector to another with Chinook heavy-lift helicopters. In addition, the military also has 100 K9-Vajra howitzers. Much of the equipment has been redirected from [India](https://www.scmp.com/topics/india?module=inline&pgtype=article)’s border with arch-rival [Pakistan](https://www.scmp.com/topics/pakistan?module=inline&pgtype=article). Meanwhile, [China’s People’s Liberation Army](https://www.scmp.com/topics/china-military?module=inline&pgtype=article) (PLA) has stepped up night drills and brought in more advanced equipment close to the Himalayan border, including new PHL-11 truck mounted self-propelled 122mm multiple rocket launchers. Last weekend, Indian army chief General Manoj Naravane, while on a visit to Leh, the capital of the northeastern region of Ladakh, told local media that the military was matching Chinese deployments and was “quite well poised to meet any eventuality”. Field trials of the K9-Vajra howitzers “were extremely successful”, he said, adding that the army had added an entire regiment of guns. Former military commanders and experts say the deployment signals India’s ongoing shift in posture towards China, from defensive to offensive, even as both sides say they are seeking to further ease tensions in the Himalayan heights of Ladakh. Earlier this year, New Delhi and Beijing agreed to disengage troops at two friction points – the Pangong Tso glacial lake in February, and Gogra in August. India’s focus for the upcoming talks would be for troops to retreat from the Hot Springs area. “It is a very significant shift on India’s part,” said D.S. Hooda, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in chief of the Indian army’s northern command.

Tensions led to a deadly clash in the Galwan Valley on June 15, resulting in fatalities on both sides. This year’s disengagement agreements have prevented the recurrence of major clashes, but Gautam Bambawale, a retired diplomat who served as India’s ambassador in China from 2017 to 2018, said the deployments showed “the situation is dangerous and can turn to conflict at a moment’s notice”.

Hence, this is going to be a long-drawn-out situation and India will have to play all its cards adroitly,” he said. India has also begun publicising efforts to ramp up its border infrastructure, with government leaders inaugurating roads and bridges that can be used to facilitate troop movement. Hundreds of people are now working to drill tunnels and construct bridges to connect the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh – which shares borders with Pakistan and China. A 6.5km tunnel, the first of four, is already completed, the Associated Press reported, adding that experts said it would provide logistics flexibility to the military. Observers say this drive will be an irritant to Beijing, which maintains an advantage on its side of the border due to consistent infrastructure upgrades over the past two decades. Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank, said New Delhi was also strengthening its deployment in the central sector of the LAC, along the Indian region of Uttarakhand. Indian media had reported that about 100 PLA soldiers had crossed into the Barahoti ridge in August, leading to questions on whether the central sector would also become an area of live bilateral conflict. _The Hindu_ newspaper on Sunday quoted Indian defence ministry officials as saying that the PLA’s pattern of large patrols was a way for China to assert its claim while also testing India across the LAC. The officials added that there was a need for better coordination between the army and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police to avoid surprises such as the Galwan clash. Joshi said China had always had “fairly extensive” claims in Uttarakhand, and while these had remained dormant, the intrusions were a reflection of recent developments, with both sides maintaining forward positions even as they discussed disengagement. India’s formation of two “strike groups” – detachments of between 30-50,000 combat troops – in Arunachal Pradesh, bordering China to the east, and Ladakh to the west signalled its “intention of fighting an aggressive battle should things go haywire,” he said.

Indian foreign ministry officials, however, blame the build-up of troops on China and say its refusal to disengage from border hotspots is the reason for rising tensions. Sushant Singh, a visiting professor of political science at Yale University and senior fellow at Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, said the ongoing Sino-Indian tensions were part of the geopolitical context in which Beijing saw New Delhi as part of Washington’s camp. With the revival of the Quad security arrangement involving the United States, Australia, India and Japan, any trust that remained between China and India had “eroded”, he said. Singh argued that India’s deployments were meant to deter escalation, but acknowledged that these tactical moves were now being seen through a “strategic prism” by Beijing. “The limited offensive options being created are of deterrence value, as deterrence through existing defensive options had evidently failed in 2020,” he added. Hooda, the former army commander, said neither side was angling for conflict, but developments showed that both sides clearly needed a new set of confidence-building measures. He said the border with China was likely to become more “contested” in future, though not to the extent of India’s border with Pakistan where rival troops exchange fire at regular intervals. “Both sides clearly need to disengage from the remaining hotspots … avoid armed clashes and avoid patrolling in disputed areas,” he said. “The whole idea is to keep the situation calm along the LAC and avoid escalation.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Delhi ramps up border forces ahead of talks ![](https://assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif) 6",

    "title": "A Cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover Is Causing a Supply Chain Disaster",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://www.wired.com/www.wired.com#main-content) Save this story Save this story For almost three weeks, the production lines at [global car giant Jaguar Land Rover](https://www.wired.com/story/jlr-jaguar-land-rover-electric-vehicle-factory-halewood/) have stood still. Usually busy turning out an estimated 1,000 vehicles per day, staff at multiple JLR factories across Britain have been told to stay at home as the automotive firm responds to a damaging cyberattack. But as its recovery has stretched from days to weeks, the knock-on impacts are being felt at the hundreds of companies that supply JLR with parts and materials and risk turning the attack into a full-blown crisis. On Friday, the UK government [admitted](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-on-government-industry-supplier-meeting-regarding-jaguar-land-rover-cyber-incident) that the cyberattack against JLR was having a “significant impact” on the company and on the “wider automotive supply chain.” The concession came as unions and officials have increasingly warned that [thousands](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyrqxj3eqqo) of jobs in JLR’s sprawling supply chain could be lost, and some smaller companies could go bankrupt. Reports claim JLR itself may be [losing up to £50 million ($67 million) per week](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c784nwvj1l3o) in the shutdown. Some firms have reportedly already laid off staff, with the [Unite union claiming](https://www.unitetheunion.org/news-events/news/2025/september/jlr-supply-chain-workers-being-told-to-apply-for-universal-credit-in-wake-of-cyberattack) that workers in the JLR supply chain “are being laid off with reduced or zero pay.” Some have been told to “sign up” for government benefits, the union claims. “It seems unprecedented in the UK to have that level of disruption because of a cyberattack or ransomware attack,” says [Jamie MacColl](https://www.rusi.org/people/maccoll), a senior research fellow in the cyber and tech research group at the security and defence think tank RUSI. That thousands of jobs could be put at risk, either temporarily or permanently, is “a different order of magnitude” to previous incidents, MacColl says. JLR, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, is one of the UK’s biggest employers, with around 32,800 people directly employed in the country. Stats on the company’s [website](https://www.jlr.com/uk-impact-report) also claim it supports another 104,000 jobs through its UK supply chain and another 62,900 jobs “through wage-induced spending.” Many other suppliers are also based outside of the UK, as well as some overseas factories. At the start of September, JLR [confirmed](https://media.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2025/09/statement-cyber-incident) it had been “impacted” by a cyberattack and that the company was taking “immediate action” and “proactively shutting down our systems,” effectively grinding its factories and production processes to a halt. As the company investigated the attack, it [revealed](https://media.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2025/09/statement-cyber-incident-1) that “some data” has been “affected” but did not specify what that data is. Despite efforts to get systems back online, the company confirmed on Wednesday that its “pause” in production has been [extended](https://media.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2025/09/statement-cyber-incident-2) to Wednesday, September 24. “We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time,” JLR said in a statement on Wednesday. “We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.” JLR did not respond to questions from WIRED about what systems were disrupted, the financial cost of the cyberattack to suppliers, nor any measures the company was looking at to support businesses. Almost immediately after the cyberattack, a group on Telegram called Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, [claimed responsibility](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gqepe5355o) for the hack. The group name implies a potential collaboration between three loose hacking collectives— [Scattered Spider](https://www.wired.com/story/scattered-spider-most-imminent-threat/), [Lapsus$](https://www.wired.com/story/lapsusdollar-uber-rockstar-breach-multifactor-authentication-weaknesses/), and [Shiny Hunters](https://www.wired.com/story/shinyhunters-hacking-group-data-breach-spree/)—that have been behind some of the most high-profile cyberattacks in recent years. They are often made up of [young, English-speaking, cybercriminals who target major businesses](https://www.wired.com/story/scattered-spider-most-imminent-threat/). Building vehicles is a hugely complex process. Hundreds of different companies provide parts, materials, electronics, and more to vehicle manufacturers, and these expansive supply chain networks [often rely](https://www.projectmanagementoffice.org.uk/automotive/driving-transformation-at-jaguar-land-rover/) [upon](https://mag.toyota.co.uk/just-in-time/) “just-in-time” manufacturing. That means they order parts and services to be delivered in the specific quantities that are needed and exactly when they need them—large stockpiles of parts are unlikely to be held by auto makers. “The supplier networks that are supplying into these manufacturing plants, they’re all set up for efficiency—economic efficiency, and also logistic efficiency,” says [Siraj Ahmed Shaikh](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/s.a.shaikh/), a professor in systems security at Swansea University. “There’s a very carefully orchestrated supply chain,” Shaikh adds, speaking about automotive manufacturing generally. “There’s a critical dependency for those suppliers supplying into this kind of an operation. As soon as there is a disruption at this kind of facility, then all the suppliers get affected.” One company that makes glass sun roofs has started laying off workers, according to a report in the [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/18/jaguar-land-rover-supplier-puts-jobs-at-risk-cyber-hack/). Meanwhile, another firm told the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdjn0lv64ro) it has laid off around 40 people so far. French automotive company [OPmobility](https://www.opmobility.com/en/), which employs 38,000 people across 150 sites, told WIRED it is making some changes and monitoring the events. “OPmobility is reconfiguring its production at certain sites as a consequence of the shutdown of its production by one of its customers based in the United Kingdom and depending on the evolution of the situation,” a spokesperson for the firm says. While it is unclear which specific JLR systems have been impacted by the hackers and what systems JLR took offline proactively, many were likely taken offline to stop the attack from getting worse. “It’s very challenging to ensure containment while you still have connections between various systems,” says [Orla Cox](https://fticommunications.com/fti-consulting-expands-cybersecurity-data-privacy-communications-practice-in-emea-with-appointment-of-orla-cox/), head of EMEA cybersecurity communications at FTI Consulting, which responds to cyberattacks and works on investigations. “Oftentimes as well, there will be dependencies on different systems: You take one down, then it means that it has a knock on effect on another.” Whenever there’s a hack in any part of a supply chain—whether that is a manufacturer at the top of the pyramid or a firm further down the pipeline—digital connections between companies may be severed to stop attackers from spreading from one network to the next. Connections via VPNs or APIs may be stopped, Cox says. “Some may even take stronger measures such as blocking domains and IP addresses. Then things like email are no longer usable between the two organizations.” The complexity of digital and physical supply chains, spanning across dozens of businesses and just-in-time production systems, means it is likely that bringing everything back online and up to full-working speed may take time. MacColl, the RUSI researcher, says cybersecurity issues often fail to be debated at the highest level of British politics—but adds this time could be different due to the scale of the disruption. “This incident has the potential to cut through because of the job losses and the fact that MPs in constituencies affected by this will be getting calls,” he says. That breakthrough has already begun. “This cyberattack is not some mere flicker on a screen, it is fast becoming a cyber-shockwave ripping through our industrial heartlands,” Liam Byrne, a member of Parliament and chair of the House of Commons’ Business and Trade committee [said](https://x.com/liambyrnemp/status/1968240209859842175) on X. “If government stands back, that shockwave is going to destroy jobs, businesses, and pay packets across Britain.” Other lawmakers have also [expressed concerns](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/emergency-intervention-plea-birmingham-jlr-32495851) after speaking with impacted JLR suppliers, and the Unite union has said the British government should intervene with a [“furlough” scheme to support workers](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/15/covidstyle_furlough_schemes_for_jlr/). “The recent cyber incident is having a significant impact on Jaguar Land Rover and on the wider automotive supply chain,” the UK’s Department for Business and Trade [said in a statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-on-government-industry-supplier-meeting-regarding-jaguar-land-rover-cyber-incident) on Friday, following a meeting with automotive industry groups. “The Government, including government cyber experts, are in contact with the company to support the task of restoring production operations, and are working closely with JLR to understand any impacts on the supply chain.” The attack is likely [another incident](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/) that demonstrates how fragile supply chains can be when they are faced with disruption. “We do need to shift to a more resilient supply chain and a resilient operation when it comes to things like manufacturing,” says Shaikh, from Swansea University. Meanwhile, MacColl says that as global tensions are high—with multiple countries taking steps to make sure they [are prepared](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/09/09/europe-war-footing-russia-ukraine-nato-defence-putin/) [for war](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpqnlxr43zdo)—the attack indicates how production can be forced to grind to a halt. “If this is the effect just that criminals can have on our supply chains, then it's quite worrying to think about how unprepared we are for, say, a more coordinated and sustained attack from a potential state adversary,” MacColl says. ## You Might Also Like … - **In your inbox:** Our [biggest stories](https://www.wired.com/newsletter/daily?sourceCode=BottomStories), handpicked for you each day - Meet the guys betting big on [AI gambling agents](https://www.wired.com/story/sports-betting-crypto-artificial-intelligence-agents/) - **Big Story:** The baby died.

If a similar outage were to occur in the UK and stretch beyond 24 hours, the effects would escalate from inconvenience to systemic risk for financial services: payment flows could seize up, trading could be disrupted, and millions could lose access to banking services. For a sector built on real-time settlement and continuous connectivity, this is a severe but plausible scenario that deserves active monitoring. These vulnerabilities are amplified by mounting pressures on the UK’s power system. Electricity demand is climbing, driven in part by the growth of data centres, the electrification of transport and heating. Much of the grid infrastructure is aging, with uneven investment in upgrades. Winter peaks are increasingly shaped by extreme weather, and longer spells of low wind or sun can tighten operating margins just as demand surges. Findings Against this backdrop, the Swift Centre Forecasters were asked: **_Will the UK experience an electricity blackout lasting over 24 hours before December 31st 2026 that severely disrupts financial services?_** ## **Findings** On average, the Swift Centre forecasters put the probability of the UK experiencing a blackout lasting more than 24 hours before the end of 2026 at 7.8%. This means roughly a one-in-twelve chance of a systemic disruption to the UK’s financial services within the next two years. And this figure only covers the most severe case – outages lasting more than 24 hours. Shorter blackouts, which can still disrupt payments and trading, are supposedly more plausible. Behind this headline number, views diverged. A group clustered at the higher end, around 17-18%, emphasising severe weather and infrastructure fragility. Others leaned much lower (0.5-5%), pointing to the historical rarity of such long outages and the grid’s proven resilience. The gap reflects different judgments about what could plausibly drive a multi-day blackout, as well as competing views on the UK’s ability to withstand shocks. Those on the lower end argued that blackouts lasting more than 24 hours are historically rare in the UK and that the grid has generally proven resilient. One noted: “ _We have events that can be considered ‘major’ UK blackouts… However, few if any lasted longer than 12 hours_.” Another gave a 2% estimate but said this would rise to 5-10% if shorter outages were considered. In their view, the most plausible drivers of a multi-day blackout would be supply shortages rather than extreme weather. While storms and floods regularly cause localised outages, these are usually resolved in under 24 hours. By contrast, past rolling blackouts were linked to fuel constraints, and the UK’s relatively small gas storage capacity still represents a vulnerability: > “ _We currently store 12 days’ worth of winter gas demand, compared with 89 days in Germany and 103 days in France._” Even so, they judged that interconnectors to Europe and imports from the U.S. and Middle East make outright shortages unlikely in the forecast period. Cyberattacks were also downplayed as a plausible trigger. The grid remains relatively isolated from the internet, and past incidents (such as the [2019 lightning strike](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d96100340f0b61743bd4cc3/20191003_E3C_Interim_Report_into_GB_Power_Disruption.pdf)) have been rapidly contained: > “A _long, nationwide blackout won’t occur, in spite of the Grid’s finer supply and response time margins._” Others in the low-probability camp nudged their estimates slightly higher (up to 5%), emphasising recent close calls and the challenges of managing a system with more variable renewables. One observed that “ _risk is higher than in the past with increased share of volatile renewables._” Another pointed to the [near-blackout in January 2025](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/09/britain-came-within-whisker-blackouts-national-grid/): “ _Such close calls do make one wonder if the system is sufficiently resilient. But at the same time, that the situation at worst would have resulted in planned blackouts of about three hours._” By contrast, those at the higher end placed more weight on weather and infrastructure fragility. One reasoned that “ _blackouts in the UK are not particularly frequent and almost all of them \\[…\\] are related to severe weather,_” and identified 3-6 instances in the past three decades where outages lasted over 24 hours, leading them to a double digit estimate. Another highlighted specific cases – the [2013 Christmas storms](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7c5576e5274a1b0042311a/DECC_-_Festive_disruption_review_-_Final__2_.pdf), [2015 floods](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-35020049), and storms [Arwen (2021)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/storm-arwen-electricity-distribution-disruption-review) and [Eunice (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Eunice#:~:text=The%20UK%20was%20particularly%20hard,km%2Fh)%20were%20recorded.) – and concluded that “ _large towns going out for more than 24 hours is quite common._” A third, giving a 17% probability, focused on infrastructure risk, pointing to [Heathrow’s 18-hour outage in 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-into-the-north-hyde-substation-outage-terms-of-reference) as a sign of weak redundancy: > “ _The recent shutdown of Heathrow due to a substation fire showed a weakness in ability to quickly shift to alternative sources._” They also added a small premium for cyberattacks, accounting for around 1.5% of their estimate. ## **If Winter Bites Harder** Forecasters were also asked to assess how their probabilities would change in the event of a severe winter in 2025 or 2026. In this scenario, severe winter was defined as record-low temperatures, low renewable generation, tight gas supplies, or extreme storms. Across the board, forecasters agreed that harsh winter conditions would make a long blackout more likely. Most described the effect as roughly doubling their baseline estimate, though the results varied widely depending on where they had started from. Justifications also differed: some emphasised the compounded stress on gas and renewables, others the physical damage caused by storms, and a few highlighted the risk of global energy supply constraints. For some, the increase was modest in absolute terms. One forecaster, for example, raised their probability from 2% to 4%, explaining: > “ _Even given a severe winter, I think the probability is very low as long as parts of the large town or region have power restored in under 24 hours, so I'm increasing my estimate by only two percentage points._” Another echoed this view, stressing that “ _Individual weather events like blizzards can cause blackouts without mounting to an extreme winter, so I go with a moderate increase._” Others arrived at higher final estimates. One calculated that roughly “ _47% of years with a major outage… would have resolved positively_” under the severe winter condition, leading them to double their baseline estimate to 40%. Another, who considered the combined risks of high winds, low temperature, major snow or ice storm, argued that resilience would be lower in such circumstances: > “ _Even the loss of a couple of power stations would be a major concern to the UK’s power grid._” They concluded that the probability would be about double their baseline, at 9.8%. Several forecasters pointed to infrastructure fragility and gas reliance as the key vulnerabilities exposed by severe winter conditions. One noted: > “ _The UK increasingly relies on natural gas and renewables. Given such reliance, a period of extreme cold along with low winds could \\[cause\\] selective power outages_.” Another cited National Energy System Operator projections showing “ _the strongest electricity operational margins for the UK grid since 2019,_” but still allowed for the possibility that an unusually cold winter could coincide with global demand pressures and LNG import shortages, settling on a 20% estimate. A final forecaster placed their probability at 25%, reasoning that while severe weather is rare in the UK, it can be very difficult to repair quickly when it does occur: > “ _Ice storms are very rare in the UK, but if they occur, can be devastating to power lines and time-consuming to repair. … I expect that loss of power to a medium-sized city for 24 hours is a relatively low bar and would be difficult to solve without repairs of numerous transmission lines._” ## **Knock-On Effects on Banking Services** Forecasters were also asked to estimate the likelihood that such a blackout would prevent at least 100,000 people in the UK from accessing their bank accounts before 2027. All forecasters judged this outcome to be plausible, with estimates ranging from 30% to 75% and averaging 58%. That implies better than even odds that a major blackout would leave more than 100,000 people unable to access their bank accounts. While confidence levels varied, the consensus was clear: a prolonged outage would almost certainly disrupt financial services on a large scale. At the top end, one forecaster assigned a 75% probability, arguing that the scale of disruption in a 24-hour+ blackout would inevitably capture this many people. Others supported this view with slightly lower estimates. One (62%) explained: > “ _If it lasts for more than 24 hours, it’s likely a nationwide blackout… This very likely means that more than 100,000 people would be unable to access their bank accounts or make payments for at least 12 hours._” Another (63%) stressed that “ _branches and ATMs would naturally be down… The last break point could be the one that matters the most, since an increasing number of people rely on the internet to bank._” Several other forecasters converging around the 50-60% range, emphasised that mundane banking services would fail under these conditions. One wrote: > “ _Should a blackout happen, just about everyone affected by a blackout will lose online access to bank accounts. The main banks may function OK for some time but \\[the\\] majority of the cashpoints will be down. And of course 99% of stores of all kinds will not be able to receive card payments._” Another added that “ _even for those with access to banking by phone app and laptop, cell tower operation, internet service, and the ability to recharge devices are likely to put the number over 100,000._” The only forecaster at the lower end (30%) argued that the internet is not always disabled during power outages, and that people might continue using phones and other battery-operated devices, limiting the number directly affected. Despite these differences, the consensus was clear: once a 24-hours blackout occurs, cascading failures across ATMs, payment systems, telecommunications, and local infrastructure make it highly likely that at least 100,000 people will lose access to their bank accounts. ## **Conclusion** Forecasters judged a multi-day UK blackout to be relatively unlikely – in the single digits under normal conditions – yet the aggregated estimate of 7.8% (with highs of 18%) is still concerning. For a risk that could paralyse payments, trading, and customer access to banking services, even single-digit probabilities amount to a material threat. The risk also rises further under severe winter conditions, with several forecasters effectively doubling their baseline estimates in that scenario. And the consensus was clear: if such a blackout were to occur, the impact on the financial system would be severe.

EASTERN: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the U.S. tariffs on Canada will be “paused” for 30 days. [Read more about the announcement here](https://globalnews.ca/news/10995552/tariffs-trudeau-trump-call-canada-us/).**_ U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://globalnews.ca/tag/donald-trump/)’s tariffs on Canada, and Canada’s retaliatory measures, could be the most “significant trade shock” that Canada has suffered in nearly 100 years, economists say. So does that mean a recession is inevitable? A Royal Bank of Canada report on Sunday compared the trade shocks from Trump’s tariffs to the ones caused by the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the 1930s. The Tariff Act of 1930, which created what’s known as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, was an American law that raised U.S. tariffs on a sweeping range of products being exported to the United States. Story continues below advertisement The tariffs were widely believed to have worsened the recession during the Great Depression. “This shock far surpasses the 2018 tariffs in magnitude, diminishing the value of that period as a helpful guide for the economic impact ahead,” RBC chief economist Frances Donald and assistant chief economist Nathan Janzen said in a new report. “For context, in 2018, the U.S. average import tariff rose from 1.5% to roughly 3%. Under the new policy, the U.S. average tariff rate \\[rose\\] to nearly 11%, the highest average ratio since the 1940s.” ## Could Canada avoid a recession? Economists generally define a recession as two consecutive quarters of an economy contracting. The RBC report said Canada could avoid a full-blown recession if the tariffs are in place for no more than a few weeks. Story continues below advertisement “Tariffs removed within a matter of weeks are likely to create a temporary stall for Canada. However, if they extend over a matter of months (e.g. 3-6 months), Canada’s recessionary risks increase rapidly,” the report said. 1:54Potential tarrif impacts on food prices Tu Nguyen, economist at RSM Canada, said sustained U.S. tariffs and a response from Canada could likely see the Canadian economy contract by two per cent – a sharp contrast to the projected 1.8 per cent growth rate for 2025. ## Get breaking National news For news impacting Canada and around the world, sign up for breaking news alerts delivered directly to you when they happen.

She said Canada could head into a recession, including job losses and inflation. “\\[Tariffs and counter-tariffs\\] would also lift inflation from the current two per cent to a 2.7 per cent headline number, as some of the increased costs from tariffs are passed onto Canadian consumers,” she said. Story continues below advertisement The RBC report said sustained tariffs would mean Canada could take up to three years to recover from the effects of a recession. “If sustained, our initial analysis suggests that tariffs of this size (based on many assumptions) could wipe out Canadian growth for up to three years, with the largest impacts in the first and second years,” the report said. The RBC report concurred with the Bank of Canada’s findings that a 25 per cent tariff applied across the board would reduce Canadian GDP by 3.4 to 4.2 per cent. ## Canadian manufacturing to take a hit Nguyen said Canada will likely see lower demand for “all goods and services like new cars, dining out and entertainment.” The auto sector in the U.S., Canada and Mexico will be particularly hard hit, she said, losing out to competitors in Europe and Asia. Story continues below advertisement “The scenario in which economic damage is minimized is one in which a trade agreement is negotiated, putting an end to tariffs. The longer tariffs and retaliation continued, the more fractured and uncompetitive the three countries’ economies became — and the more economic pains consumers would feel from higher prices, fewer goods available and fewer jobs,” she said. 0:34Canadian sports fans boo U.S. national anthem in response to Trump tariffs According to RBC, Canada’s manufacturing sector accounts for nine per cent of the total GDP and 70 per cent of total trade with the U.S. “Canada’s manufacturing sector is most exposed, but the knock-on effects will also matter in many other indirectly exposed industries,” the report said. The industry that could be hit the hardest is the auto manufacturing sector and in addition to job losses and slower economic growth, Canadians could face higher prices. Story continues below advertisement “Prices of perishable goods such as fruits and vegetables are likely to jump as early as this coming week, given that they cannot be stockpiled in advance. Although the price of goods like appliances and cars would take longer to increase, they will inevitably rise,” Nguyen said. The RBC report said the American economy, too, would feel the pain of Trump’s new policy. American manufacturing businesses are likely to slow down and American consumers are likely to feel the burden on their pocketbooks. “While the U.S. economy is starting from a relative place of strength (and is far less reliant on trade), it will face a shock large enough to adjust most forecasts downward on growth and upwards on inflation. Additional retaliatory policies from Canada and/or Mexico will likely exacerbate these impacts,” the report added. _**Are you changing your spending habits, either to buy Canadian or try to save more in case of hard economic times ahead?

While the two sides have not engaged in significant cross-border clashes since 2020, they are maintaining large troop deployments, and sporadic encounters between opposing forces risk miscalculation and escalation into armed conflict,” states the annual threat assessment of the US intelligence community, released by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on Monday, as it talks about potential inter-state conflicts. The report highlights a fragile global order, China’s military expansion plans, its aggressive cyber operations and its possible attempt to influence the 2024 US presidential elections. It further talks about other conflicts including the Israel-Hamas war and the Russia-Ukraine war. Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week inaugurated the strategic Sela tunnel, built at an altitude of 13,000 feet in Arunachal Pradesh, that will provide all-weather connectivity to Tawang. Infrastructure projects near Indo-China border have gathered pace since a military standoff with China in Ladakh sector of the [Line of Actual Control](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-stern-warning-to-india-on-deploying-more-border-troops-won-t-ease-tensions-101709890661820.html)(LAC) began in May 2020. Both sides have arrayed close to 50,000 troops each in Ladakh sector and India has made it clear that bilateral relations cannot be normalised till there is peace and tranquility in the border areas. The report also points to possible armed conflict between India and Pakistan as well in case of any provocations from Islamabad. “New Delhi and Islamabad are inclined to sustain the current fragile calm in their relationship following their renewal of a cease-fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in early 2021. However, neither side has used this period of calm to rebuild their bilateral ties as each government has focused on more pressing domestic priorities including election perpetrations and campaigning and for Pakistan, concerns over rising militant attacks in its west,” the report underscores. “Pakistan’s long history of supporting anti-India militant groups and India’s increased willingness, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to respond with military force to perceived or real Pakistani provocations raise the risk of escalation during a crisis. There remains the potential for an event to trigger a rapid escalation,” it added. On China’s plans to create overseas bases in India’s neighbourhood and other areas, the report states that the [People’s Liberation Army (PLA)](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/view-se-la-tunnel-will-allow-faster-indian-response-in-case-of-chinese-aggression-101709984264115.html) will “continue to pursue the establishment of overseas military installations and access agreements in an attempt to project power and protect China’s interests abroad”. “Beyond developing its military base in Djibouti and its military facility at Ream Naval base in Cambodia, Beijing reportedly is considering pursuing military facilities in multiple locations, including—but not limited to—Burma, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Pakistan, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Tanzania, and the UAE,” it says. The report notes that Beijing will focus on building a fully modernized national defense and military force by 2035 and for the PLA to become a world-class military by 2049. “In the meantime, the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) hopes to use the PLA to secure what it claims is its sovereign territory, to assert its preeminence in regional affairs, and to project power globally, particularly by being able to deter and counter an intervention by the United States in a cross-Strait conflict”, it adds.

    "full_text": "The Line of Actual Control (LAC), the 4,057-kilometer boundary that runs between China and India along the arc of the world's highest mountains, has caused its share of strife. Over the years, the LAC has sparked standoffs, skirmishes and war between the two expanding nuclear powers. To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.

On April 28, India and Pakistan entered their fifth consecutive day of cross-border gunfire, following India's accusations that Pakistan was involved in the April 22 militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 civilians and injured 17 others. The Resistance Front -- a militant group India accuses of being a front for the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba -- initially claimed responsibility for the attack, which it says was in opposition to India sending more than 85,000 \"outsiders\" to Kashmir to promote \"demographic change.\" The Resistance Front, which formed in the wake of India's contentious 2019 revocation of Kashmir's autonomy, has claimed sporadic attacks on non-locals in the region...",

This demonstrates how cyber operations have evolved beyond merely gathering intelligence. When first identified by US government partners back in mid-2023, the campaign by the Salt Typhoon group was assessed as a targeted espionage effort against US and allied government systems. It involved stealthy intrusions, selective data theft and probing of networks in a handful of countries. At the time, the effect was thought to be limited and largely confined to government targets. But August 2025 disclosures have shown just how broad the campaign truly has been. The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has [publicly attributed](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/countering-chinese-state-sponsored-actors-compromise-of-networks-worldwide-to-feed-global-espionage-system) the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. They are central to rivalry. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge. The Indo-Pacific is the epicentre of 21st-century competition. China and the US vie for influence, while South Korea, India, Japan and Southeast Asian countries all face mounting digital vulnerabilities. With the digital economy of Southeast Asian nations expected to surpass US$1 [trillion](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/asean-building-trust-digital-economy/) by 2030, growth is driving their prosperity but also compounding risk. Chinese-sponsored hackers have been targeting critical infrastructure for a long time. Suspected Chinese hackers disrupted India’s [port](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/securing-indian-ports-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-and-the-road-ahead) logistics in 2020, and repeated intrusions have targeted Japanese, South Korean and Australian energy grids, telecom systems and government networks. Cyber operations are applied to traditional hotspots—such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait—by threatening disruption without any shots being fired. Beyond the sheer number of cyber incidents, patterns in their objectives distinguish cyber operations in the Indo-Pacific from those in other regions. Three stand out: probing, pressuring, and threshold testing. Probing operations aim to identify and target system vulnerabilities. Chinese threat group APT41 often employs this method. The [group](https://cyberscoop.com/apt41-fireeye-china/) has conducted espionage operations across healthcare, telecoms and government agencies for many years. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has perfected a distinct form of probing: cyber-heists, ranging from the 2016 Bangladesh Bank [hack](https://cyber.uk/areas-of-cyber-security/cyber-security-threat-groups-2/nation-state-hackers-case-study-bangladesh-bank-heist/) to ongoing cryptocurrency thefts that directly fund Pyongyang’s weapons programs. These operations map vulnerabilities and generate funds, while staying below the threshold of conventional war. Australia has been a repeated target of pressuring tactics, with the [breaches](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/reports-and-statistics/annual-cyber-threat-report-2023-2024) of critical infrastructure widely interpreted as signaling that Canberra’s alignment with Washington has costs. Taiwan is another case in point. During its 2024 elections, disinformation campaigns, distributed denial-of-service attacks on government portals, and breaches of media outlets sought to [undermine](https://saferinternetlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Panel-4-Summer.pdf) confidence in the democratic process. These pressures were synchronised with more visible coercion, such as military exercises and air incursions, illustrating how digital operations complement kinetic manoeuvres. Some cyber campaigns appear to be aimed at threshold-testing, blurring the line between espionage and sabotage. In the Vietnam–China cyber [clashes](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/vietnams-securitisation-of-cybersecurity-under-growing-chinese-cyber-threats/) related to South China Sea disputes, Vietnamese hackers allegedly targeted Chinese government websites. Similarly, the 2021 Japan Olympics cyberattacks, which [some](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54600098) attributed to Russian actors, demonstrated how geopolitical rivalries could extend into civilian life. Together, these incidents outline a region where states and non-state actors continually challenge each other’s resolve. Skirmishes might not cause immediate destruction, but they foster digital coercion and raise the risk of escalation. Cyber campaigns are not just harassment; some signal a potential for escalation. Attacks against Taiwan’s government networks have spiked during Chinese military drills, showing how cyber and kinetic tools are increasingly integrated. The danger lies in miscalculation. A ransomware strike that disrupts Japan’s energy grid or South Korea’s financial sector could be interpreted as state-backed aggression, prompting military responses. In cyberspace, where [attribution](https://academic.oup.com/isp/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/isp/ekae022/7903056) is murky and timeframes are compressed, escalation could outrun diplomacy. Repeated incidents also risk normalising cyber coercion as a standard tool of statecraft. If probing and pressure go unchallenged, adversaries will keep pushing until the region faces a full-scale digital confrontation. The Indo-Pacific has become a laboratory for cyber conflict, setting global precedents. Europe, Latin America and Africa should watch closely: today’s coercion in Asia could become tomorrow’s global standard. Cyber skirmishes in the Indo-Pacific mark the cutting edge of strategic competition, where adversaries test limits and normalise coercion. The region’s growing dependence on digital infrastructure, combined with its strategic volatility, makes it a perilous testing ground for cyber conflict globally. The choice is stark: treat these incidents as minor disruptions until one sparks a crisis, or act to strengthen resilience, deepen cooperation and set rules for [responsible](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/curbing-the-cost-of-cybersecurity-fragmentation-an-agenda-for-harmonisation-across-the-indo-pacific/) behaviour in cyberspace. If governments fail, adversaries will decide the thresholds for acceptable action—and by then it may be too late.

[Doomberg](https://substack.com/@doomberg) Sep 10, 2025 ∙ Paid 785 [167](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/mosaic-theory/comments) 21 [Share](javascript:void(0)) _“The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.”_ – Michael Porter A dramatic series of diplomatic events took place over the past several weeks that leaves little doubt: profound geopolitical change is afoot **.** We took note when Russian President Vladimir Putin rode in US President Donald Trump’s limousine in Anchorage, Alaska, during their hastily prepared summit in mid-August. Two weeks later in Tianjin, China, Putin hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his own limousine for a secret session that reportedly lasted about an hour. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that the “home walls” of the limousine—presumably highly resistant to eavesdropping—underpinned the rationale for the chosen venue. Let’s take a ride \\| Getty The momentous 2025 Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, followed by a spectacular heavy weapons military parade in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, solidified the idea that a historic global power pivot is underway. The extraordinary presence of North Korea leader Kim Jong Un alongside Putin and China’s President Xi Jinping was a bold statement of Eurasian unity against Western hegemony—a force that any unbiased observer would have to admit is in steep decline. President Trump conceded as much in a remarkable post on Truth Social, where he stated, _“Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!”_ Nuclear triad \\| Getty If history is any guide, legacy media is the last place one should look for the truth about what is actually occurring behind the scenes. Political insiders routinely obfuscate, misdirect, and outright lie to journalists who are more than happy to report things they know perfectly well aren’t true **.** The story exists because “sources” said it, too often with little attention paid to the veracity of what is being claimed. What Trump, Putin, and Modi discussed during those limousine rides is undoubtedly historic, but years will likely pass before their true nature becomes known—if it ever does. As we described in last month’s Pro Tier presentation, _“_ [Lateral Thinking](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/lateral-thinking) _,”_ our approach to such uncertainty is to develop mental models based on axioms that need not necessarily be true, only plausible. As long as they trigger new and interesting ways to speculate about the problem, brainstorming around such axioms can lead to counterintuitive and useful insights. During a text exchange over the weekend with our friend Luke Gromen—author of the outstanding weekly newsletter _[Tree Rings](https://fftt-treerings.com/)_ and himself an excellent lateral thinker who is often years ahead of the legacy media—an interesting axiom was proposed: What if the trade was for Venezuela? Gromen’s speculative axiom neatly synthesizes several concepts we have been writing about for some time. In December of 2023, we published “ [The New World’s Oil](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/the-new-worlds-oil),” highlighting the enormous oil and gas potential of the Western Hemisphere, particularly in Venezuela. On the very day in January that Trump was inaugurated for a second term, we released “ [Misreading the Room](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/misreading-the-room),” in which we speculated that the new administration would make regime change in Venezuela a top priority. Three weeks ago, we published “ [Blooming Flower](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/blooming-flower),” to note how a critical mass of oil and gas supermajors had assembled in Venezuela’s neighborhood—a development that has historically foretold an unpleasant future for strongman dictators on the critical path of oil development. The plausibility of such a shift got a boost last Friday, when _Politico_ published a most interesting [article](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/05/pentagon-national-defense-strategy-china-homeland-western-hemisphere-00546310): > “ _Pentagon officials are proposing the department prioritize protecting the homeland and Western Hemisphere, a striking reversal from the military’s yearslong mandate to focus on the threat from China. A draft of the newest National Defense Strategy, which landed on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s desk last week, places domestic and regional missions above countering adversaries such as Beijing and Moscow, according to three people briefed on early versions of the report._ > > _The move would mark a major shift from recent Democrat and Republican administrations, including President Donald Trump’s first term in office, when he referred to Beijing as America’s greatest rival. And it would likely inflame China hawks in both parties who view the country’s leadership as a danger to US security._” Broadening the axiom further, what if the entire Western Hemisphere were deemed by the three superpowers to be firmly back within America’s sphere of influence, with China pulling back? True or not, pondering the question leads to some interesting predictions. Let’s suspend disbelief and take a tour of Central and South America. ## This post is for paid subscribers [Subscribe](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/subscribe?simple=true&next=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter.doomberg.com%2Fp%2Fmosaic-theory%3Fimg%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fe024c584-1eda-4b89-a1fb-e05d66952bb8_1024x683.heic%26open%3Dfalse&utm_source=paywall&utm_medium=web&utm_content=173193562) [Already a paid subscriber? **Sign in**](https://substack.com/sign-in?redirect=%2Fp%2Fmosaic-theory%3Fimg%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fe024c584-1eda-4b89-a1fb-e05d66952bb8_1024x683.heic%26open%3Dfalse&for_pub=doomberg&change_user=false) PreviousNext",

The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control.

    "full_text": "Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the luxury carmaker owned by Tata Motors, announced on Tuesday that its global retail and production operations have been “severely disrupted” due to a cyberattack. The company confirmed that it had shut down its systems as a precautionary measure to contain the impact. According to AFP, the UK-based automaker said, “At this stage there is no evidence any customer data has been stolen but our retail and production activities have been severely disrupted,” adding that it is “working at pace” to restart worldwide operations. The incident highlights the increasing vulnerability of luxury retailers and auto brands to cybercriminals. Recently, Marks and Spencer suffered a major attack that disabled its online operations for weeks, causing losses of £300 million ($402 million). Other well-known British retailers such as Harrods and Co-op have also faced cyber threats in recent months. For Jaguar Land Rover, the cyberattack adds to a string of recent setbacks. Earlier this year, the automaker paused exports to the United States after tariffs imposed under former President Donald Trump, which triggered a steep decline in sales. In July, JLR announced plans to cut up to 500 UK management jobs to manage costs. Although a new trade agreement between London and Washington lowered tariffs on UK car exports to 10% from 27.5%, the concession only applies to a limited quota of 100,000 vehicles annually, restricting the company’s ability to recover volumes.

    "full_text": "- About WordPress - [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) - [Documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/) - [Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/) - [Support](https://wordpress.org/support/forums/) - [Feedback](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/requests-and-feedback) - Search [Skip to content](https://securityonline.info/doj-charges-uk-national-linked-to-scattered-spider-in-115m-cyber-extortion-scheme/#content) The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has unsealed a criminal complaint charging Thalha Jubair, a 19-year-old United Kingdom national, with leading roles in an international cybercrime and extortion campaign attributed to the notorious Scattered Spider group. According to the complaint, Jubair — known online as “EarthtoStar,” “Brad,” “Austin,” and “@autistic” — conspired to infiltrate U.S. corporate and government networks, steal sensitive data, and extort victims for millions. “ _From as early as May 2022 to as recently as September 2025, Jubair and his associates were involved in approximately 120 network intrusions, including accessing the computer networks of at least 47 U.S.-based victims,_” the DOJ [stated](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-kingdom-national-charged-connection-multiple-cyber-attacks-including-critical). Collectively, victims paid more than $115 million in ransom payments. Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti underscored the scale of the damage: “ _Jubair is alleged to have participated in a sweeping cyber extortion scheme carried out by a group known as Scattered Spider, which committed at least 120 attacks worldwide and resulted in over $115 million in ransom payments from victims. These malicious attacks caused widespread disruption to U.S. businesses and organizations, including critical infrastructure and the federal court system_.” The complaint alleges Jubair personally targeted a U.S.-based critical infrastructure company and the U.S. Courts between October 2024 and January 2025. Investigators say he and his co-conspirators laundered ransom funds through cryptocurrency wallets, including $36 million seized by law enforcement and another $8.4 million Jubair allegedly transferred to evade seizure. The indictment ties Jubair to Scattered Spider, also tracked as Octo Tempest, UNC3944, and 0ktapus — an eCrime collective infamous for social engineering campaigns. Jubair and his associates allegedly relied on phishing, SIM-swapping, and fraudulent helpdesk calls to trick employees into handing over credentials. Once inside, they encrypted data, threatened leaks, and demanded multimillion-dollar payouts. “ _As alleged by the complaint, Jubair went to great and sophisticated lengths to keep himself anonymous while he and his criminal associates continued to attack these victims and extort tens of millions of dollars in ransom payments_,” said Alina Habba, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. “ _But thanks to the relentless investigation of this Office and our FBI and CCIPS partners, Jubair could not remain anonymous and avoid justice indefinitely_.” Jubair faces multiple counts, including computer fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, and two counts each of computer fraud and wire fraud. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 95 years in prison. ### Related Posts: - [US Enterprises Targeted: Silent Push Unmasks Scattered Spider’s Phishing Web](https://securityonline.info/us-enterprises-targeted-silent-push-unmasks-scattered-spiders-phishing-web/) - [Scattered Spider Evolving: New Tactics and Spectre RAT](https://securityonline.info/scattered-spider-evolving-new-tactics-and-spectre-rat/) - [Scattered Spider Targets the Cloud: A Growing Threat to the Insurance and Financial Sectors](https://securityonline.info/scattered-spider-targets-the-cloud-a-growing-threat-to-the-insurance-and-financial-sectors/) - [Global Cyber Authorities Warn of Escalating Threat from Scattered Spider Group](https://securityonline.info/global-cyber-authorities-warn-of-escalating-threat-from-scattered-spider-group/) - [BlackCat Ransomware and Beyond: Deciphering Scattered Spider’s Latest TTPs](https://securityonline.info/blackcat-ransomware-and-beyond-deciphering-scattered-spiders-latest-ttps/) Rate this post ### Found this helpful?

The United States’ power grid, once a marvel of 20th-century engineering, is now teetering on the edge of collapse. As demand surges from emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles, an aging infrastructure struggles to keep up. Recent blackouts, escalating costs, and regulatory bottlenecks are painting a picture of a system pushed to its limits. This article explores the crisis, what investors should watch for moving forward, and the ripple effects on everyday consumers, drawing on expert analysis and recent data. ### The Cracks in the Foundation: Why the Grid is Failing ### [Are you Paying High Taxes in New Jersey, New York, or California?](https://energynewsbeat.co/invest/) America’s electrical grid was largely built in the mid-20th century, with much of its transmission and distribution infrastructure now over 50 years old. According to recent reports, the grid faces unprecedented stress from a combination of factors. Electricity demand is skyrocketing: AI data centers alone consumed about 4.4% of U.S. electricity in 2023, a figure projected to triple by 2028. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts electricity sales to climb from 4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025, equivalent to adding the power needs of seven Seattle-sized cities in the next decade. Extreme weather exacerbates the vulnerabilities. Heatwaves in Texas and storms in California have triggered widespread blackouts, reminiscent of the 2003 Northeast blackout that left 50 million people in the dark. Cybersecurity threats and physical attacks on substations are on the rise, with the Department of Homeland Security emphasizing the grid’s critical status. Supply chain issues further compound the problem: lead times for large power transformers have stretched beyond 30 months by mid-2025, delaying essential upgrades. Regulatory hurdles add to the chaos. Transmission projects face five-to-seven-year delays due to permitting issues, jurisdictional disputes between utilities, states, and federal agencies, and policy gridlock. The CIRCUIT Act, introduced in February 2025 to boost domestic transformer production, remains stalled in Congress. Deloitte estimates that the U.S. power sector will require $1.4 trillion in new capital investments between 2025 and 2030 just to maintain reliability. ### Investment Opportunities: Where to Look as the Crisis Unfolds For investors, this gridlock isn’t just a headache—it’s a goldmine of opportunities. The push for modernization and reliability will favor certain sectors over others. Here’s what to watch: ### Behind-the-Meter Solutions and Companies As the centralized grid falters, decentralized “behind-the-meter” technologies—such as battery storage, microgrids, and rooftop solar—are gaining traction. These solutions allow businesses and households to generate and store power independently, reducing reliance on the main grid. Companies like Fluence Energy, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are poised for growth, with demand surging for their storage systems to handle peak loads from data centers and EVs. The Department of Energy (DOE) is allocating $32 million in 2025 for smart EV charging and distributed energy integration, signaling federal support. Investors should eye firms innovating in energy management software and modular storage, as these could see explosive adoption in high-demand regions like Northern Virginia, which handles 70% of global internet traffic. ### Natural Gas and Oil Companies Reliability is king in a strained grid, and fossil fuels still provide the backbone. With coal plants retiring (e.g., Utah’s 1,800 MW Intermountain Power Project), natural gas and oil are stepping in as “bridge” fuels. The DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants to avert shortages. Natural gas firms benefit from their flexibility and lower emissions profile compared to coal, while oil companies could see upticks in backup generation demand. Look for integrated energy giants with strong midstream assets, as they can capitalize on rising wholesale prices in deregulated markets like Texas and Arizona, where cooling demands are surging. Grid UtilitiesTraditional utilities are investing heavily to shore up the system. The DOE aims to boost long-distance transmission capacity by 16% by 2030 through 7,500 miles of new lines. Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion Energy, and Avangrid are leading the charge—Avangrid, for instance, plans $20 billion in investments across 23 states through 2030. These regulated utilities offer stable dividends and exposure to rate hikes as costs pass through to consumers. Independent power producers like NRG Energy are also attractive, profiting from elevated wholesale electricity prices amid supply constraints. In summary, a diversified approach makes sense: behind-the-meter for growth potential, natural gas/oil for reliability plays, and utilities for steady returns. However, risks like regulatory changes and supply chain disruptions loom large—focus on companies with strong balance sheets and innovation pipelines. ### How Consumers Will Feel the Pinch The grid’s woes will hit consumers hardest through higher bills and unreliable service. As utilities pass on upgrade costs, residential electricity prices are climbing nationwide—up about 6.5% from May 2024 to May 2025. Blackouts could become more frequent, disrupting daily life, work, and safety, especially in vulnerable areas prone to weather extremes. The impact varies by state, with some already facing exorbitant rates due to reliance on imported fuels, geography, or high demand. Below is a table of the top 10 most expensive states for residential electricity, based on EIA data for June 2025 (in cents per kWh). These states, often coastal or isolated, illustrate the uneven burden. Consumers in these states could see monthly bills exceed $200 for average usage, prompting shifts toward energy efficiency, solar adoption, or even relocation. Nationally, a Microsoft and Google-backed report warns of a shortage of 500,000 electricians in the next decade, further delaying home upgrades and EV installations. ### Looking Ahead: A Call for Action America’s grid crisis demands urgent investment and policy reform to avert catastrophe. While challenges mount, they also herald a transformation toward a smarter, more resilient energy system. Investors who position themselves wisely—balancing innovation with reliability—stand to benefit, but only if policymakers act swiftly. For consumers, the message is clear: prepare for higher costs and potential disruptions by exploring personal energy solutions today. ## [Avoid Paying Taxes in 2025](https://energynewsbeat.co/investinoil/) [Crude Oil, LNG, Jet Fuel price quote](http://energynewsbeat.co/tradingdesk/) [ENB Top News](http://energynewsbeat.co/top-news/)[ENB](http://energynewsbeat.co/) [Energy Dashboard](https://dashboard.energynewsbeat.com/?_gl=1*ij4iab*_ga*NTEyODgzNzk5LjE3MjM3Mzk2NjU.*_ga_JDVH4V200Q*MTcyNTU2OTQ3MC4xMzMxLjEuMTcyNTU2OTQ5Ny4zMy4wLjA.)

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "- About WordPress - [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) - [Documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/) - [Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/) - [Support](https://wordpress.org/support/forums/) - [Feedback](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/requests-and-feedback) - Search [Skip to content](https://securityonline.info/fbi-alert-two-cybercriminal-groups-are-actively-compromising-salesforce/#content) The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in coordination with DHS/CISA, has released a new FLASH Alert (FLASH-20250912-001) warning organizations of two cybercriminal groups—UNC6040 and UNC6395—actively compromising Salesforce instances to steal sensitive data and extort victims. According to the [alert](https://www.ic3.gov/CSA/2025/250912.pdf), “ _Both groups have recently been observed targeting organizations’ Salesforce platforms via different initial access mechanisms_.” The FBI urges enterprises to review the provided indicators of compromise (IOCs) and strengthen defenses. Since late 2024, UNC6040 has relied on voice phishing (vishing) campaigns to trick call center employees into sharing Salesforce credentials. The actors often impersonate IT support staff to create a sense of urgency. The alert explains, “ _UNC6040 threat actors commonly call victims’ call centers posing as IT support employees… Under the guise of closing an auto-generated ticket, UNC6040 actors trick customer support employees into taking actions that grant the attackers access_.” Key tactics include: - Credential Harvesting – Directly requesting usernames, passwords, and MFA codes. - API Exploitation – Using Salesforce Data Loader to exfiltrate bulk customer records. - Malicious Connected Apps – Deceiving victims into authorizing rogue OAuth applications, which bypass MFA and appear as legitimate integrations. The FBI notes, “ _Authorizing a malicious connected app bypasses many traditional defenses such as MFA, password resets, and login monitoring_.” Some UNC6040 victims later received extortion emails allegedly from the ShinyHunters group, demanding cryptocurrency payments to prevent data leaks. Meanwhile, UNC6395 has been running a parallel campaign using compromised OAuth tokens linked to Salesloft Drift, an AI chatbot integrated with Salesforce. “ _In August of 2025, UNC6395 threat actors exploited compromised OAuth tokens for the Salesloft Drift application… Using the compromised OAuth tokens and third-party app integration, UNC6395 threat actors were able to compromise victims’ Salesforce instances and exfiltrate data_.” On August 20, 2025, Salesforce and Salesloft revoked all active Drift tokens, cutting off unauthorized access. The FLASH alert includes extensive IP addresses, URLs, and user-agent strings tied to both groups. Among them are domains like: - login\\[.\\]salesforce\\[.\\]com/setup/connect (malicious app authorization page) - IPs such as 185.141.119.136, 146.70.165.47, and 192.42.116.179 The FBI cautions defenders that these indicators “ _may not be indicative of a compromise_” by themselves, but should be correlated with broader network activity. The FBI outlines several defensive measures organizations should take immediately: - Train call center staff to detect vishing attempts. - Deploy phishing-resistant MFA across all critical services. - Apply least-privilege access controls using AAA (authentication, authorization, accounting). - Monitor API usage and OAuth integrations for anomalous behavior. - Rotate API keys and tokens for all third-party applications. - Log and analyze network traffic for data exfiltration patterns. ### Related Posts: - [UNC6040 Threat Actor Exploits Salesforce via Vishing and Malicious Data Loader Apps](https://securityonline.info/unc6040-threat-actor-exploits-salesforce-via-vishing-and-malicious-data-loader-apps/) - [Google Admits Salesforce Breach, Joins Chanel & Allianz on ShinyHunters Victim List](https://securityonline.info/google-admits-salesforce-breach-joins-chanel-allianz-on-shinyhunters-victim-list/) - [Voice Phishing on Microsoft Teams Facilitates DarkGate Malware Attack](https://securityonline.info/voice-phishing-on-microsoft-teams-facilitates-darkgate-malware-attack/) - [Data Theft Alert: Salesforce Instances Breached via Third-Party App OAuth Tokens](https://securityonline.info/data-theft-alert-salesforce-instances-breached-via-third-party-app-oauth-tokens/) Rate this post ### Found this helpful?

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

In October, the South China Morning Post reported that China had revived plans to build a 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) tunnel to divert water to Xinjiang province from the Yarlung Tsangpo River in southern Tibet and was testing the technique on a separate tunnel project. China denied that any such plans were underway. But when the Sang River then appeared muddier than normal in recent weeks and displayed elevated levels of iron, it struck a nerve in India. A local leader running for office in Arunachal Pradesh speculated that Chinese construction was responsible for the pollution, but he failed to provide evidence to back up his assertion and both Indian and Chinese leaders denied that China was responsible for the muddy waters. On Dec. 4, Indian Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said an earthquake that took place...

India's Adani Group conglomerate, controlled by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, saw the value of its listed companies plunge dramatically in late January and early February after investment research suggested that Adani's businesses had used a web of shell entities to manipulate stock prices in order to issue more debt. The Adani Group has denied the allegations. This decrease in value forced the company to cancel its $2.4 billion share sale on Jan. 31, and on Feb. 6-7, Adani announced his intention to pre-pay loans, including loans backed by Adani Group shares, to calm investor sentiment and demonstrate that the conglomerate has sufficient liquidity.

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

(YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images) In early fall, we examined the implications of increasing energy prices, including their potential to generate social unrest. Since then, many countries have witnessed more generalized inflation -- which is causing prices to rise for a variety of essentials, not just the energy that consumers pay to heat their homes, cook their food and drive their cars -- suggesting that unrest risks are expanding as more countries and more items are affected. As concerns grow that inflationary pressures will persist long into 2022 it is worth examining what countries may be most vulnerable to inflation-driven unrest and how it could play out. To do so, looking back at previous episodes of unrest linked to price rises can help evaluate what could happen in the coming year....

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

(Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Thus far, only sporadic violent plots and a few low-level attacks have targeted AI infrastructure like data centers. For the most part, pushback has taken the form of rhetoric and some nonviolent protests. The muted response reflects the fact that, for now, AI has yet to significantly demonstrate the type of grand promises or perils forecast by its dreamers or doomsdayers. This will not last. As AI ripples across societies and workplaces, upending daily life, labor markets and politics, the upheaval will inevitably spark backlash -- and at least some of the aggrieved will resort to violence.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Advertisement Power imports, mainly from an Adani Power-run coal-fired plant in eastern India, rose 70 per cent in the seven months through July and helped satisfy most of the rising demand, government data showed. Natural gas accounted for about two-thirds of Bangladesh’s power demand in the decade that ended in 2020, but the country has been boosting power imports and local coal-fired generation due to gas infrastructure challenges and to cut costs. “It’s about cost-effectiveness, and gas is required for the fertiliser industry, whereas cheap electricity can be received from other sources, including fuel oil,” said Adeeba Aziz Khan, director of Bangladesh’s Summit Power. Her firm runs a dozen power plants using gas and fuel oil. Advertisement “There is a shortage of gas for electricity generation and evacuation problems,” Khan said on the sidelines of the APPEC conference, adding that it was difficult to see a resurgence in gas-fired generation in the “foreseeable future”.

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply.

(BIJU BORO/AFP/Getty Images) ## Highlights - _Despite the size and importance of the massive interconnected river system China and India share (along with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh), no integrated structure exists for its management, and the bilateral agreements that govern it are far from sufficient._ - _Political disputes, such as the 2017 standoff over the Doklam Plateau, could harm the waterways China and India share._ - _Unless the countries agree to institute a basinwide mechanism for water management, the river systems they both depend on will be at risk._ Nearly a year after their standoff on the Doklam Plateau began, India and China are trying to get their relationship back on track. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last month in Wuhan with just that goal in mind, and though their summit was more spectacle than substance, it was nonetheless a necessary step toward resolution. The informal meeting gave the two leaders a prime opportunity to lay aside, however briefly, their countries' long-standing differences and focus on topics of mutual concern, such as climate change, food security and natural disasters. Yet one related issue was missing from the agenda: water. If Beijing and New Delhi fail to address the matter, the repercussions for the region, its inhabitants and its environment will likely be devastating....

    "full_text": "If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations.

Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance Washington could start imposing tariffs against a wider...

Prasit Photo \\| Moment \\| Getty Images Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that “reciprocal” tariffs, first announced in April, will take effect on Aug. 1 for countries that haven’t struck a deal. Trump added in a separate announcement Sunday that an [additional 10% tariff](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/07/trump-says-countries-aligning-with-brics-bloc-will-face-extra-tariff.html) would be charged to countries “aligning themselves with the anti-American policies of BRICS” without elaborating. His announcement came as the BRICS bloc of developing countries gathered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for a two-day summit. Earlier on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that [tariffs introduced in April will be enforced starting August 1](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/06/bessent-tarrifs-trump-august.html) for countries that haven’t finalized an agreement with the Trump administration. While Bessent dismissed the notion that August 1 represents a fresh deadline, he acknowledged that the new date could allow trading partners additional time to renegotiate tariff terms. Japan’s benchmark [Nikkei 225](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.N225/) slipped 0.56% to close at 39,587.68 while the Topix declined 0.57% to close at 2,811.72. South Korea’s Kospi added 0.17% to end the trading day at 3,059.47 and the small-cap Kosdaq closed 0.34% higher at 778.46. Australia’s [S&P/ASX 200](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.AXJO/) slid 0.16% to end the day at 8,589.3. Hong Kong’s [Hang Seng index](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.HSI/) lost 0.61%, and mainland China’s CSI 300 dipped 0.43% to 3,965.17. The Reserve Bank of Australia kicks start its two-day meeting, where it is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points to 3.60%. U.S. stock futures fell after Trump confirmed that tariffs are set to go into effect Aug. 1, not July 9. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 146 points, or 0.32%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.39% and 0.42%, respectively. Last Friday stateside, the three major averages closed higher. The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) and [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) powered to new highs and capped off a winning week as banking behemoths ushered in a promising start to the third-quarter earnings season.

[Data from Japan’s ministry of health, labor and welfare](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/database/db-l/r07/2505pe/2505pe.html) revealed that real wages fell 2.9% in May compared to the year before.

The ministry’s data shows that nominal wages have risen every month from December 2021. _—Lim Hui Jie_ ## Private credit’s trillion-dollar boom is fueling warnings of a hidden financial contagion Private credit has swiftly emerged as one of the hottest corners of global finance, and its rapid rise is prompting alarm bells. It comes as no surprise that industry observers are saying private credit could become a locus of contagion in the next financial crisis, said Shihan Abeyguna, Morningstar’s Southeast Asia managing director. According to PitchBook data, the private debt industry is sitting on $566.8 billion worth of funds ready for deployment— a historic level of dry powder. Fund managers are incentivized to lend quickly and put them to work, as one cannot collect fees on cash that is lying around, added Abeyguna. “If this becomes reality, then managers may find themselves lowering lending standards in a bid to lend more money, which leads to a higher default risk,” he told CNBC.

ANZ economists forecast that the RBA will cut its cash rate by 25 basis points in the July and August meetings given the “overall resilience” in Australia’s economy and ongoing tightness in the country’s labor market. Similarly, Commonwealth Bank of Australia sees a 25 basis points cut, and believes a 50 basis points reduction is not on the table given the “less uncertain global environment” relative to May. _—Lee Ying Shan_ ## Trump says countries aligning with BRICS policies will face additional 10% tariff U.S. President Donald Trump announced that an additional 10% tariff will be charged to countries “aligning themselves with the anti-American policies of BRICS,” without elaborating. “Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social Sunday evening stateside. Separately, Trump confirmed that the U.S. will start delivering letters on Monday, detailing country-specific tariff rates and any agreements reached with various trading partners.

This subset of the alliance — comprising heavyweight producers Russia and Saudi Arabia, alongside Algeria, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates — met digitally. They had been expected to increase their output by a smaller 411,000 barrels per day. The [U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@CL.1/) 1.91% to $65.72 per barrel, while global benchmark [Brent](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@LCO.1/) was down 1.17% to $67.50 per barrel as of 9.06 a.m. Singapore time. If there is no reversal of these output hikes, “the stage is set” for an oil surplus, which will drag oil prices even further going into the end of the year, said Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho Securities’ head of macro research, Asia ex-Japan. _—Lee Ying Shan, Ruxandra Iordache_ ## Asia-Pacific markets kick off Monday trading lower Asia-Pacific markets kicked off Monday trading lower.

Nathan Howard \\| Reuters U.S. President Donald Trump and high-ranking Cabinet officials confirmed that tariffs will go into effect Aug. 1, not July 9. Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were asked in an interview with pool reporters Sunday to clarify when the new higher tariffs rates will be implemented. Lutnick responded, “Tariffs go into effect Aug. 1. But the president is setting the rates, and the deals, right now.” Trump assented with the statement. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent [said in an interview](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/06/bessent-tarrifs-trump-august.html) on CNN’s “State of the Union” that tariffs announced back in April will go into effect on Aug. 1 for those countries that have yet to reach an agreement with the U.S. He said duties will “boomerang” back to higher April 2 levels if there is no progress. As of Sunday, Trump’s April 9 [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/modifying-reciprocal-tariff-rates-to-reflect-trading-partner-retaliation-and-alignment/) which established the July 9 tariff implementation date did not appear to have been formally revised. While the president has broad tariff powers, the April 9 order would typically be replaced with a new order establishing the Aug. 1 date. The White House did not immediately reply to a question from CNBC about whether the president planned to issue a new executive order before July 9. _— Sarah Min_",
