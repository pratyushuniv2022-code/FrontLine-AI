Previously, 28 people from the district worked in the Maoist party and their number has come down now because of the efforts being made by the State Government and Bhadradri Kothagudem Police to wean away Maoist’s influence in the district. The family members of the underground Maoists have to take the responsibility of encouraging the Maoists to surrender for leading a normal life. The government provides support for the rehabilitation of surrendered Maoists, the SP said, adding that the Maoist leaders were terrorising innocent tribals and forcing them to join the banned Maoist party to engage them in illegal activities for their selfish interests. Knowingly and unknowingly, some went underground and now find it difficult to join the mainstream of life. **Read less...** | | May - 2 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders are resorting to acts of violence in Bhadradri Kothagudem District of Telangana, said Bhadrachalam, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Paritosh Pankaj, on May 2, reports Telangana Today.

In a statement, ASP Pankaj said, Maoists were committing criminal offences to show their presence and harassing the innocent tribal people of the agency areas. The Naxals \\[Left Wing extremists, LWEs\\] have become obstacles to development. The top leaders of the Maoist party were compelling their lower-level cadres to commit illegal activities with the aim of extorting money and troubling innocent tribals in many ways for their selfish interests. Minor boys and girls were being tortured by the Naxals forcing them to join the Maoist party. The ASP noted that many cadres attracted by the ‘Operation Chayutha’ are planning to surrender, but they were being prevented doing so by Maoist top leadership. **Read less...** | | May - 11 | Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today. In a statement the official said that Maoist top leadership for the wellbeing of their family members have been making the lower ranks scapegoats. Innocent Adivasi youths were being forced to join the Maoist party and giving them arms to attack Police forces. For the selfish needs of Maoists, the lives of Adivasi boys and girls were being spoiled as they were deprived of education. Maoists like Sodi Jogaiah, Rajesh, Sodi Mada and others, killed in encounters, were made to join the Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] when they were minor in age and the party top leadership should take responsibility for their deaths, the SP said. Maoist leaders Damodar, Azad, Aruna and others sending ill-gotten money to their family members but meting out injustice to Adivasi families, which were compelled to sacrifice their children for Maoist leaders, SP, Vineeth noted. **Read less...** | | May - 13 | Drones will be put into service to keep an eye on the movements of the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) in Koraput, Odisha Director General of Police (DGP) Sunil Kumar Bansal said on May 13 during his visit to the district, reports sambadenglish.com.

Previously, operations in **Read more...** Security Forces (SFs) in Bastar are all set to launch ‘Operation Monsoon’ — a major anti-Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) campaign — in the interiors and border areas of the insurgency-hit districts from June to September, reports The Times of India on June 27. Previously, operations in remote and interior areas used to be paused during the rains, inadvertently giving space to Maoists to carry out recruitment drives or hold meetings with villagers. For the past three-four years, however, specially trained units of state and central security forces have pressed on with operations in forests in monsoon, resulting in the killing of 29 Maoists in encounters since 2020. The past years’ operations have been an example against the perceived notion that security forces wouldn’t be able to carry out operations due to overflowing nullahs, canals and slippery terrain in the forests of Bastar, a Police officer said. Bastar range Inspector general of Police (IGP) Sundarraj P told that security camps established in more than 60 spots in the remote areas have “choked the Maoists” and become “bottleneck points” for movement of the insurgents, while giving forces access to the forests. “Earlier, operations would be stalled but for the past 3-4 years, our ops continue during the (rainy) season, bringing results. CRPF \\[Central Reserve Police Force\\], CoBRA \\[Commando Battalion for resolute Action\\] and Special Task Force \\[STF\\] will be carrying out operations as they are well trained in jungle warfare. An action plan is in place to deal with the challenges of monsoon in the forest and conduct searches,” Sundarraj said. The inter-state operations on bordering areas like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra will also be intensified in the coming weeks and the jawans were well equipped for it. The morale of SFs is high despite casualties, the senior Police officer said. “We have recorded significant positive operational outcomes during this monsoon, since we have made decisive inroads into the erstwhile Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] strongholds by opening strategic operational base camps,” said Sundarraj. **Read less...** | | July - 12 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kot **Read more...** The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kothagudem of Telangana on July 12, reports Telangana Today. Jagan called upon the public to revolt against the ‘fascist Brahmanical Hindutva agenda of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of the UCC. As the people’s opposition towards the BJP’s nine-year rule was on the rise, the BJP was planning to execute its divisive and communal agenda. Through the UCC, Hindutva forces want to create a nefarious divisive line based on religion prior to the five state elections and the general election in 2024. In the last nine years of Narendra Modi's rule, the Indian economy has witnessed prolonged stagnation and decline, he said. Poverty, diseases, the gap between the rich and the poor, and attacks on minorities, dalits, and adivasis have reached levels never seen before. More than 800 million people have been pushed below the poverty line. Jagan noted that the BJP was trying to divert all these from the public’s mind. There would be a threat to the religious rights of minorities, tribals, and even Hindus because of the UCC. The BJP was also dehumanising the Muslim community and wrongly projecting them. There was a need to build a mass movement against the UCC, Jagan added. **Read less...** | | July - 13 | The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. The Maoist leaders for whom wanted notices were issued are Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, and Venkata Ravi Chaitanya alias Aruna. In its statement, the NIA said Aruna and Gajarla Ravi are the key executors of the Maoist strategies in Andhra Pradesh. The NIA informed us further that Aruna led the Maoist group that killed the former MLAs. The double murder took place while Kidari Sarveshwara Rao and Siveri Soma were visiting an interior village in the Araku assembly constituency of Andhra Pradesh. NIA re-registered the case on December 6, 2018 and took up the investigation. In June 2021, the NIA filed a supplementary chargesheet in the case against a woman area committee member of the Maoist group. The NIA said the woman Maoist leader, whom they identified as Kalavathi alias Bhavani, was instrumental in providing logistical support to the team that carried out the killing. **Read less...** | | July - 14 | Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Time **Read more...** Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Times of India on July 15. Maharashtra forces, which have already alerted the Central Government about the Maoists trying to bounce back in Chhattisgarh, have put their security and intelligence units on high alert on the stretch between Kanker-Narayanpur and Bijapur national park. A senior official from the security and intelligence wings said around 1,000 cadres have been recruited by the Maoists in Dantewada and Sukma regions. Another 200–250 new cadres were recruited by the Maoists in South Bastar. \"Earlier, there were barely 50–100 cadres in south Bastar and 200–400 in Dantewada and Sukma, which now have swelled to a substantial number after fresh recruitment,\" said the official. He said the concern was that Maoists would regroup and try to bounce back to their former strength in Chhattisgarh, which would not augur well for Gadchiroli and Gondia across the border in Maharashtra. Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) Sandip Patil, also the chief of the Anti-Naxal Operations (ANO) for Maharashtra, said the central government has been briefed about the developments in Chhattisgarh, which may now affect Maharashtra too, but did not divulge further details. \"Maharashtra forces are ready with strategies to counter any fresh threats,\" he said. It’s been learned that the Maoists are planning major attacks on Police posts that the Governments of different states are opening in their strongholds in central India. The Maoists’ ‘technical and research’ wing is said to be developing Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED) to blow them up near Police posts after mounting them on tractors or four-wheelers used in the rural areas.

The anti-Naxal crackdown by the Special Task Force (STF) along with other Security Forces (SFs) has dried up the weapons pipeline, leading to the number of armed extremists dropping drastically in the state, said a senior Police officer. \"Now the Bihar Police, in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and other concerned wings of the government, have intensified their crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui districts in the state\", Sushil Mansingh Khopde, Additional Director General (ADG-operations), STF, said. The ADG said despite law enforcement agencies destroying hundreds of acres of poppy plants each year, inputs suggest that clandestine opium poppy cultivation is present in certain pockets in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts. \"Inputs also suggest that Maoists \\[Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist)\\] have been using opium cultivation as a source of revenue in these areas. They levy a 'tax' on poppy cultivators and small enterprises. Law enforcement agencies destroyed around 600 acres of poppy plantation in these areas in 2021, and in 2022, around 1200 acres were destroyed\", the ADG said, adding, \"The concerned district police and other agencies have been instructed to keep a vigil on clandestine opium poppy cultivation in specific areas in the district.\" Further, ADG Khopde said, \"The number of Maoist-affected districts will further reduce in the coming months. No major Maoist incidents have been reported till June this year. Some armed cadres are only concentrated on the hills of Chakarbandha on the Gaya-Aurangabad border near Jharkhand and in the hilly areas of Jamui and Lakhisarai-Munger. The STF and Central forces have confined them there.

In a press note issued on November 23, the OSD reminded people that Maoists had issued a statement urging the people to boycott the impending Assembly elections slated for November 30. He, however, reassured the public of the foolproof security arrangements in place to ensure the smooth conduct of the elections. The Maoist action team, reportedly comprising members such as Kunjam Idumal alias Mahender, Kovvasi Ganga alias Mahesh, and others, has reportedly crossed into the Mulugu area with intentions to disrupt the elections. Their strategies allegedly involve targeting security personnel, people’s representatives, political leaders, and officials involved in election duties, instigating fear and chaos among the public. “To combat this threat, Mulugu police have initiated stringent measures, including drone surveillance, cordon search operations, tactical vehicle checks, and area dominance,” the OSD said, emphasizing the grave risk posed by the Maoists to politicians and others, urging the people to remain vigilant and cautious. **Read less...** | | November - 23 | Jharkhand Chief Minister (CM) Hemant Soren, on November 23, declared that the state Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) are in the concluding stages of eliminating Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] menace in the state, reports The Telegraph.

    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#content) Author ### [Pearl Pandya](https://acleddata.com/staff/pearl-pandya) South Asia Research Manager _On 21 May, Indian security forces killed the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI (Maoist)), Nambala Keshava Rao, also known as Basavaraju, in Chhattisgarh state. He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&nbsp;_ _In this Q&A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world._ ## **The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it?** The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed.[1](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote1) So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( _see graph below_). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.[2](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote2) Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts.[3](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote3) Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. Close footnote ## How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also [targeted locals](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/) whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes.[4](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote4) Close footnote ## What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk.[5](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote5) And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so.

    "full_text": "“I have said in the past that left-wing extremism is the single biggest security challenge to the Indian state. It continues to be so.” – Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.[i] From Ideology To Warfare The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. Resurgence Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. A New Strategy “We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.” -Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. Overruns On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • Used improvised explosive devices. Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • Assassinated officials. In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • Destroyed police infrastructure. Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj Systems Disruption At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? The Deviant Economic Engine “The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.” -Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. The Revolutionary Tax In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. A Revolutionary Tax Economy To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • Mining. Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • Narcotics. India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • Informal tolls. Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. A Strategic Half-Life “It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they look to the Naxals for justice.” –Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future.

India has seen a sharp rise in cyberattacks over the last few years, which has turned data protection into a top security concern. According to **CERT-IN,** between **2021 and mid-2025,** India recorded more than **2.2 million** cybersecurity incidents, averaging more than **3,000 attacks per day,** with financial services, healthcare, telecom, and government platforms among the hardest hit. Hackers focused on cloud misconfigurations, unpatched servers, and weak internal access controls. The list below tracks **25 major cyberattacks in India** from 2021 to 2025, showing how they happened and what strategies can be used to prevent similar breaches. ## **1\\. Angel One AWS resource breach/potential data leakage, February 2025** Angel One, India's largest broking firm, was recently hacked. Hackers gained access to an unsecured AWS storage bucket linked to it, exposing the sensitive data of **7.9 million** users, such as trading details, email addresses, and customer IDs. Cloud management made sensitive data visible on public servers. To avoid such scams, similar companies must audit all cloud buckets, enable encryption, and always restrict public access through IAM (Identity and Access Management) rules. ## **2\\. AI-generated Phishing and Infostealer Surge, 2025** In 2025, several Indian banks and fintech platforms reported a rise in AI-generated phishing scams. Attackers used a realistic, AI-written email to fool users into giving away credentials. Thousands have already fallen victim to these smarter phishing campaigns by unknowingly entering their bank credentials, leading to financial losses and identity theft. Attackers also used voice cloning and deepfake technology to impersonate officials, which makes the deception look more convincing. One must consider the fact that constant user training, spam filters, and AI-based email scanning tools block most phishing messages before they reach inboxes. ## **3\\. Aditya Birla Capital Digital (ABCD) App Hack, 2025** Hackers targeted a weakness in the ABCD mobile app API, revealing customers' loan and PAN details. The attackers targeted unprotected endpoints, which allows data scraping. API vulnerabilities remain a growing concern for finance apps. However, routine code audits with secure token validation and regular app updates can stop such data exposure. ## **4\\. Star Health Threats, May 2025** Star Health, one of India's largest health insurers, experienced a major data breach that affected 31 million policyholders; much of the core information, including medical records, insurance details, and personal information, was breached and even published on the dark web. This breach shows how healthcare data can be exploited for identity theft. Encrypting health records, segmenting sensitive systems, and ensuring continuous monitoring can reduce such risks. ## **5\\. Delhi Hospitals Ransomware Attack, June 2025** Delhi's **Sant Parmanand** and **NKS Super Speciality** hospitals were targeted by ransomware that locked almost all patient and billing data. Over **60,000 records** were affected by this attack. The attack used phishing emails to deliver ransomware payloads. The malware spread quickly through unprotected hospital networks. Hospitals should isolate administrative and patient data systems, train staff to identify suspicious emails, and maintain offline data backups. ## **6\\. Kolkata Police Cyber Crime Wing Data Breach, August 2025** Weak internal passwords and a lack of access control allowed hackers to access internal police systems, where investigation details from the Cyber Wing in Kolkata were leaked. This breach exposed officer credentials and case data. The attack raised alarms about insider threats and the need for stronger law enforcement cybersecurity. Police and law enforcement agencies should adopt role-based access control, enforce password rotations, and enable two-factor authentication for internal systems. ## **7\\. Multiple Cyberattacks on Indian Governments, 2024.** Multiple state e-governance portals were hacked in 2024, leaking citizen Aadhaar and bank details. At least **2.5 million** records were compromised across several platforms. Many portals lacked basic HTTPS encryption, which allowed attackers to exploit outdated plugins and weak admin passwords. That's why regular CMS updates, secure admin logins, and government-wide cybersecurity policies are vital for protection. Every e-governance platform must undergo quarterly vulnerability assessments and follow a national cybersecurity standard to protect public data. ## **8\\. Polycab Ransomware Attack, March 2024** Polycab India, a top cable manufacturer, suffered a ransomware attack, causing a **Rs 20 crore** operational loss. The breach started from an infected employee workstation and ended with hackers encrypting internal files and demanding high payments. The attack also affected the supplier and distributor network, exposing the ripple effect of industrial cyber incidents. ## **9\\. Indian Energy Sector Attack, 2024** This breach shows the exposure of operational technology systems, where hackers tried to infiltrate India's power grid through malware-infected email attachments sent to energy employees. The attack aimed to disrupt the electricity supply but was quickly contained. **Tip:** Separating IT and OT networks and constantly monitoring power infrastructure can prevent major outages like this. Moreover, conducting red team simulations and regular cybersecurity drills helps reduce the chance of large-scale blackouts. ## **10\\. BSNL Data Breach, May 2024** Personal details of **2.9 million** broadband subscribers were leaked from a BSNL database due to old, unpatched systems. Leaked data included phone numbers and service details. The breach came from a neglected internal server. The outdated system, left without proper monitoring, became an easy entry point. Updating infrastructure and restricting admin access can prevent similar service providers. **Read Also: [Top 30 Best-Known Cybersecurity Case Studies 2025](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-best-known-cybersecurity-case-studies)** ## **11\\. UP Marriage Assistance Scheme Leak, 2024** The Uttar Pradesh Marriage Assistance Scheme is a welfare initiative aimed at helping low-income families. Data from the welfare portal of Uttar Pradesh leaked, including Aadhaar, bank details, and contact information, affecting **200,000** applicants. The data was found indexed on search engines, shockingly. The root cause was traced to poor web server configuration and missing access restrictions. A web firewall and regular penetration testing could have prevented this from happening. ## **12\\. Airtel India Customer Database Leak (375 Million Users), June 2024** Hackers claimed to sell a database of **375 million** users, which would be nearly **25%** of India's population. Airtel denied the break, but the data was widely shared online. The leak included Aadhaar numbers and personal details. Even if false, it revealed risks from third-party data handling. Telecom companies must run vendor audits and apply zero-trust security across all databases, anonymising customer data wherever possible to reduce exposure if leaks occur. ## **13\\. WazirX Hack, July 2024** Crypto firms must use cold wallets for storage and conduct third-party code audits before deploying smart contracts. WazirX, a crypto exchange, was targeted by hackers who were exploiting blockchain smart contract vulnerabilities. Roughly **$230 million** worth of assets were at risk. This breach clearly highlights that public blockchain code, if left unaudited, can create hidden backdoors. ## **14\\. boAt India Data Breach, 2023** Encrypting user data and applying hashed passwords are key to securing e-commerce databases. In 2023, an unsecured server was recently exposed, exposing **7.5 million** customer records, including names and contact information. The leak spread on Telegram and hacking forums. Weak password protection made recovery even harder. Many users later reported spam calls and targeted ads due to leaked data. ## **15\\. Telangana Police's Hawk Eye App Data Breach, 2023** Hackers accessed the Hawk Eye mobile app, revealing user profiles and feedback reports. The app, meant for citizen safety, accidentally exposed personal data through a misconfigured API. Public-facing government apps should use token-based access, secure API gateways and regular security reviews before each software update. **Read Also: [Top 50 Cyber Security Projects for Final Year Students (2025 Edition)](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-25-cyber-security-projects-for-final-year-students)** ## **16\\. Hyundai Motor India Data Leak, 2023** Thousands of car owners whose contact and vehicle details were stolen were found on the dark web. The source of the breach was traced to a third-party vendor responsible for managing the dealer's database. Weak vendor access controls and outdated security measures worsened the system, risking identity misuse because the data appeared on dark web forums for sale. ## **17\\. SPARSH Data Breach, 2023** The Ministry of Defence's SPARSH portal suffered a breach, which exposed pensioner IDs and bank details. Hackers used credential stuffing techniques on weak passwords. This breach raised national security concerns as the portal handled sensitive military data. Multi-factor authentication, stronger password policies, and regular login behaviour analysis can stop similar attacks. ## **18\\. Sun Pharma Cyber Attack, 2023** Pharmaceutical giant Sun Pharma's ransomware disrupted its internal operations and supply chain, causing **Rs. 30 crore** in losses. Hackers entered through a phishing email and encrypted internal servers. Companies should train employees to identify phishing attempts, install anti-ransomware software, and maintain offline data backups for rapid recovery. ## **19\\. BharatPe Hacked: August 2022** Phishing emails led to a breach of employees' inboxes, leaking internal documents and financial reports. The attackers used social engineering to mimic trusted contacts, tricking employees into sharing login credentials. While no customer data was stolen, the breach hurt investor confidence. Using email MFA, spam filters, and awareness campaigns can block future phishing attempts. ## **20\\. Cyberattack on AIIMS: December 2022** India's top hospital, AIIMS, suffered a ransomware attack that took **3 million** patient records. The servers remained slow for approximately two weeks, which caused major disruption. **Read Also: [The Rise of Agentic AI in Cyber Warfare: Implications for Global Security](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/the-rise-of-agentic-ai-in-cyber-warfare-implications-for-global-security)** ## **21\\. CloudSEK Data Breach: December 2022** In 2022, hackers stole internal data from the cybersecurity firm CloudSEK and exposed API keys on **GitHub.** The breach revealed how even security companies can be vulnerable. Never use credentials in code repositories, and rotate all access tokens regularly. ## **22\\. Swachhta Platform Hacked, September 2022** Hackers breached India's Swachh Bharat (Clean India) platform, a government site that collected public sanitation feedback and cleanliness reports. The attackers took advantage of outdated CMS plugins and weak credentials, allowing them to deface the homepage and delete parts of the citizen feedback database. ## **23\\. Zivame Data Breach, 2022** In 2022, Indian lingerie retailer Zivame experienced an excessive data breach exposing personal and transactional information of nearly **1.5 million** customers. The data included names, phone numbers, email addresses and partially masked payment records. Investigators traced the cause to an unsecured database server left open to the public without password protection. The leaked dataset appeared later on dark web forums for sale. ## **24\\. Air India / SITA Passenger Data Breach, 2021** Recently, in 2021, a global cyberattack on SITA, the IT provider for various airlines, exposed personal data of over **4.5 million** Air India passengers, which included passport details, ticket numbers, birth dates, and contact information. The breach was traced to unauthorised access in SITA's passenger service system, which connected multiple airlines worldwide, compromising long-term passenger privacy. That's why airlines and travel companies must vet all external vendors for compliance with strict cybersecurity standards, enforce encryption for shared databases and deploy continuous threat detection across connected systems. ## **25\\. Domino's India Customer Data Leak, 2021** Hackers exposed nearly **180 million** customer order details, including their names, phone numbers and even GPS coordinates. Attackers used an unsecured server within the company's order-tracking infrastructure, and later they published the full dataset on the dark web. The exposed location information was essentially alarming, as it could reveal customers' routines and residential details. Companies handling location-based services should encrypt all customer data, mask stored addresses and set strict retention periods for order records. **Read Also: [Zero Trust Security: The Future of Cyber Defense](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/zero-trust-security-the-future-of-cyber-defense)** ## **In the End** India's cybersecurity reflects both rapid progress and rising exposure. Attackers have now shifted to multi-stage ransomware, insider misuse, and AI-generated phishing. Organisations that invested early in zero-trust controls, employee awareness programmes, and regular threat monitoring have contained incidents faster and have limited damage. Every sector, private or public, must treat cybersecurity as an **operational priority** rather than a compliance task tied to reputation, customer trust, and business continuity. ## **Frequently Asked Questions** ### **Which sector faces the most cyber threats in India?** The financial, healthcare, telecom and e-commerce sectors top the list due to their high data value. Banking APIs, digital payment apps, and hospital systems are common ransomware and credential theft targets. ### **What are the main reasons behind the rise in cyberattacks in India?** The main reasons are rapid digitisation, weak password habits, over-reliance on cloud storage without proper encryption, and phishing campaigns using AI-written messages. ### **How can individuals protect themselves from data leaks in India?** Use unique passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, avoid public Wi-Fi for banking, and never click unknown links in SMS or WhatsApp messages.

While the establishment of the [**National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/national-disaster-management-authority-1) marked a positive step.

In this critical scenario, reactive measures are no longer enough. India needs a **proactive approach** that prioritizes disaster preparedness. ### What is the Framework Related to Disaster Management in India? - **Disaster Management Act of 2005:** The [**Disaster Management Act of 2005**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/disaster-management-act-2005-invoked) has provided the legal and institutional framework for disaster management in India at national, state and district levels. - While the **primary responsibility of disaster management rests with the States**, the Central Government supports the efforts of State Governments by providing logistical and financial support. - **Institutional Framework under Disaster Management Act of 2005** : - **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA):** Apex body headed by the **Prime Minister,** responsible for policy, plan, and guideline formulation for disaster management (DM). - NDMA addresses both **natural and man-made disasters** and coordinates enforcement and implementation. - **National Executive Committee (NEC):** Assists NDMA, chaired by the Union **Home Secretary,** comprising various secretaries and officials. - Prepares and monitors the National Plan for DM and coordinates responses to disaster situations. - **State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA):** Headed by the **Chief Minister,** responsible for state-level DM policies and plans, coordinating implementation, and integrating mitigation measures in state development plans. - **District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA):** Led by the **District Collector** with an elected representative as Co-Chairperson. - Prepares and implements district-level DM plans and ensures compliance with national and state policies. - **Local Authorities:** Includes **[Panchayati Raj Institutions](https://www.drishtiias.com/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-national-institutions/panchayati-raj-institution-pri), [Municipalities](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/urban-local-government-in-india)**, **District and Cantonment Boards**, and Town Planning Authorities. Responsible for capacity building, relief, rehabilitation, and preparing DM plans. - **Key Institutions:** - **National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM)**: Focuses on capacity development, training, research, and documentation. - Functions under NDMA’s guidelines and aims to become a **‘Centre of Excellence’ in DM.** - **National Disaster Response Force (NDRF):** Specialized response force for natural and man-made disasters, including Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear emergencies. - Operates under NDMA's direction, with eight battalions positioned across different locations. - **Committees:** - **Cabinet Committee on Management of Natural Calamities (CCMNC):** Oversees management of natural calamities, suggests preventive measures, and promotes public awareness. - **International Commitments:** - [**Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR):**](https://www.drishtiias.com/summary-of-important-reports/sendai-framework-report) India is a signatory to the SFDRR which was adopted during the **Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction** in March 2015. - India is dedicated to achieving the seven goals set under the framework through systematic and sustainable efforts. - **Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA):** India is a signatory to the HFA, adopted globally to reduce disaster losses in lives and economic and environmental assets. - The HFA set three strategic goals and five priority action areas focused on integrating disaster risk reduction into **sustainable development policies,** capacity building, preparedness, and vulnerability reduction. ### What are the Current Major Disaster Threats that India Faces? - **Floods**: India experiences frequent [**floods**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/floods-havoc-in-india#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20cause%20of,dams%2C%20barrages%2C%20or%20siltation.), particularly during the monsoon season.

- **Urbanization and Unplanned Development:** Rapid urbanization and unplanned development in cities have increased the vulnerability to disasters like floods and earthquakes. - **Example:** The **2023 Chennai floods** were attributed to unchecked development and encroachment on water bodies and wetlands. - **Rising Climate Change Impact:** Climate change is amplifying the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like cyclones, floods, and droughts. - **Example**: The devastating [**Cyclone Amphan in 2020**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-amphan) was fueled by warmer ocean temperatures due to climate change. - **Aging Infrastructure and Lack of Maintenance:** India's aging infrastructure, such as **dams, bridges, and buildings, coupled** with inadequate maintenance, increases the risk of disasters. - The **Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water** in 2023 raised concerns over the safety of aging dams that are **more than 100 years old.** - **Environmental Degradation:** Activities like **deforestation, mining, and unsustainable land-use practices** have increased the risk of landslides and soil erosion. - **Example:** The [**2022 Joshimath land subsidence crisis**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/joshimath-land-subsidence) in Uttarakhand was attributed to unregulated construction and mining activities. - **Industrial and Technological Hazards:** India's growing industrialization and reliance on hazardous materials increase the risk of industrial accidents and chemical disasters. - **Example:** The gas leak at a chemical plant in **Visakhapatnam** (2020) exposed thousands to toxic fumes. ### What Measures Should India Adopt to Reduce Disaster Risk and Enhance Disaster Preparedness? - **Establish Dedicated Disaster Response Corridors:** Designate and develop dedicated disaster response corridors, including **road networks, rail links, and air routes,** to ensure uninterrupted access for emergency services and aid during disasters. - These corridors could be designed to be resilient to hazards and equipped with necessary infrastructure and resources for efficient disaster response. - **Promote Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure:** Mandate the adoption of disaster-resilient design and construction principles for all critical infrastructure projects, such as bridges, dams, power plants, and communication networks. - Implementing **stricter building codes** that mandate disaster-resistant construction using **earthquake-proof materials, fire-proof materials and wind-resistant designs**. - Additionally, offering tax breaks and financial assistance for retrofitting existing structures to improve their resilience. - **Develop Disaster-Resilient Agricultural Practices:** Promote the adoption of disaster-resilient agricultural practices, such as drought-resistant crops, precision farming, and soil conservation techniques. - Learning from successful examples like **Burkina Faso's Zai pit farming technique,** which enhances soil moisture retention and crop yields during droughts. - **Promote Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR):** Integrate ecosystem-based approaches into disaster risk reduction strategies by conserving, restoring, and sustainably managing natural ecosystems like **forests, [wetlands](http://wetlands), and coastal habitats.** - These ecosystems can act as **natural barriers against hazards like floods, storms, and landslides,** while also providing co-benefits like carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. - **Strengthen Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems:** Develop robust, integrated early warning systems that can detect and provide timely alerts for multiple hazards, such as cyclones, floods, heatwaves, and landslides. - Leveraging advanced technologies like **[remote sensing](https://www.drishtiias.com/current-affairs-news-analysis-editorials/news-editorials/2023-05-12), AI, and [big data analytics](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper3/big-data-1)** to improve hazard monitoring, forecasting, and risk communication. - **Micronet Grids for Critical Infrastructure:** Establish localized, self-sufficient power grids powered by renewable sources like solar and micro-hydro for critical infrastructure like hospitals and communication systems. - This ensures continued functionality even during widespread power outages caused by disasters. - **Mental Health Response Teams:** Integrating mental health professionals into disaster response efforts to provide **psychological support** to survivors dealing with trauma, anxiety, and displacement. This can significantly improve long-term recovery outcomes. - **Enhanced Institutional Capacity:** The institutions must hire permanent workforce rather than contractual. - A permanent workforce allows for continuous **skill development, knowledge transfer, and institutional memory.** - This fosters a more capable disaster management system compared to relying on temporary staff who may lack experience. - Moreover, the Local bodies should be allocated a substantial **Disaster Readiness Reserve to complement disaster reactivity to proactive measures.** | | | --- | | **_Drishti Mains Question:_** Examine the factors contributing to India's increasing vulnerability to disasters.What measures should India adopt to enhance its disaster preparedness?? | ### UPSC Civil Services Examination Previous Year Question (PYQ) ### _Mains:_ **Q.** Discuss the recent measures initiated in disaster management by the Government of India departing from the earlier reactive approach. **(2020)** **Q.** Vulnerability is an essential element for defining disaster impacts and its threat to people.

Shah](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/kriti-m-shah) _The citizens’ right to protest is a pillar of Indian democracy. While citizens are allowed to peacefully assemble, however, protests and demonstrations sometimes take a violent turn; recent examples are the Jat protests in Haryana and the Kashmir unrest following the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, both in 2016. During such occasions, it is the prerogative of the Indian state to deal with the violent civil protests in a manner that ensures public order and protects citizens from harm. This paper discusses the use of force by security officials during periods of violent civil unrest and seeks to understand the ways and means of dealing with such protests in the country._ ## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

Along with an exchange of drone strikes, conventional missile firings, and aerial dogfights, the skirmish continued in the information domain, with Pakistani media reporting that the country’s military cyber wing [disrupted](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546050/security-sources-reveal-details-of-pakistans-massive-cyberattack-against-india) a communications network in India, predominantly affecting power distribution lines and government websites. Meanwhile, hackers sympathetic to the Indian government [leaked](https://x.com/cyberforcex) compromised data from Pakistan’s taxation authority and [targeted](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/how-pro-india-hackers-defended-country-during-cross-border-cyberattacks-amid-op-sindoor/articleshow/121385229.cms) other digital infrastructure. The active incorporation of cyber operations in this recent crisis, at least as acknowledged in public media reporting on both sides, is a departure from the past. It also raises serious concerns about the challenge of attribution on the subcontinent. Assigning responsibility for cyber operations comes with political, legal, and technical challenges. For one, in hostile India-Pakistan ties, there is limited space to entertain an ill-substantiated or inaccurate attribution as it risks escalation or creates domestic pressure for retaliation. Also, public attribution may be limited by the lack of well-established national frameworks for doing so. Neither India nor Pakistan currently have an official public attribution policy, making it difficult to assess their evidentiary standards and the validity of their threat intelligence. Limited official documents on procedures for incident response and forensic capacity suggest caution with regard to the credibility of public attribution. Thirdly, in cyber geopolitics, public attribution is a strategic choice determined by decisionmakers on a case-by-case basis. Cyber operations work best when clandestine and thus attribution is often intentionally restricted to avoid exposing technical capability. This is likely why Pakistan and India have generally approached official public attribution for cyber operations with caution in the past. The deployment of cyber-attacks complementary to kinetic operations along with unverifiable and potentially premature public attribution could set a dangerous precedent for a strategic environment as hostile and fragile as South Asia. Thus, in the absence of credible attribution tools and mechanisms, Islamabad and New Delhi would have to firmly resolve to adhere to responsible state behavior in cyberspace by doing the following: 1) establishing a cyber hotline to ensure communication channels are open, 2) supporting the applicability of international law to cyberspace, and 3) committing to non-proliferation of intrusive cyber technologies to non-state Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups to conduct cyber operations on their behalf. [\\[1\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn1) More broadly for each, institutionalizing their attribution process would ensure transparency and reassurance. **India and Pakistan’s Cyber Doctrines** Even apart from its prominent role in the recent India-Pakistan crisis, cybersecurity has found a significant place in both countries’ national security postures in recent years. In 2019, then Indian Minister of State for Defence [confirmed](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-approves-setting-up-of-defence-cyber-agency/articleshow/72264836.cms) the development of a defense cyber agency to handle cyber threats in a military context as well as budgetary allocations for cyber operations. In 2021, India’s former National Security Advisor acknowledged New Delhi’s capability to conduct “ [cyber sabotage and cyber warfare _._](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/M.-K.-Narayanan-on-India-Pakistan-diplomacy-and-terrorism/article55940567.ece)” And in 2024, the Indian Ministry of Defence [announced](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-formulate-new-doctrine-for-cyberspace-operations/articleshow/111094158.cms) a joint doctrine for cyberspace operations, shifting away from the country’s previous policy of strategic ambiguity on the use of cyber in the warfare domain, and integrating both [defensive and offensive capabilities](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2153626). [\\[2\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn2) While Pakistan does not have a pronounced cyber doctrine, Islamabad’s national security posture reflects the necessity of integrating cyber capabilities with military operations. Inaugurating the Army’s Cyber Division in 2018, the then Chief of Army Staff articulated that “ [firepower and cyber have emerged as the mainstay of future war.”](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369646/firepower-cyber-have-emerged-as-mainstay-of-future-war-coas) Pakistan has also invested in cyber capacity, as the [2021 National Cybersecurity Policy](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) reiterates, to protect national critical infrastructure as well as government information systems. These policy documents underline that India and Pakistan recognize the importance of investing in cyber capability to uphold their national interests. The next section explores how each state potentially uses these capabilities for strategic gain. **Cyber Capability and Operations** Countries are increasingly employing state capabilities to conduct cyber operations to achieve strategic objectives such as intelligence gathering; Pakistan and India are no different. Over the past few years, each state is alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage. This is done either through state capability or threat actors backed by the state. Publicly available information suggests that [APT 36](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/apt-36)—also known as [Transparent Tribe](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/transparent-tribe-apt36-pakistan-aligned-threat-actor-expands-interest-in-indian-education-sector/) and [SideCopy](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/operation_c-major)—is a Pakistan-linked APT group, alleged to have conducted cyber [espionage](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) particularly in India and Afghanistan. Likewise, APT groups such as [Sidewinder](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0121/#%3A~%3Atext%3DSidewinder%20is%20a%20suspected%20Indian%2CChina%2C%20Nepal%2C%20and%20Afghanistan) and [Patchwork](https://medium.com/@Ab_Hussain/indian-apts-target-middle-east-1e4a11b3ce95) are thought to be Indian state-backed threat actors, conducting cyber operations in Pakistan and elsewhere. > “Over the past few years, \\[India and Pakistan are\\] alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage.” While there is limited information publicly available regarding the cyber operations conducted by each side, some sources do point to state acquiescence or support. A report by a Canadian firm [revealed](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/media/27613/ocr) that in 2021, the Indian government had allegedly conducted [cyber surveillance](https://www.dawn.com/news/1636767) on Pakistan’s [political leaders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/) using the Israeli [Pegasus software](https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-pegasus-spyware/). India-based hacking groups reportedly continued to [target](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) Pakistani government entities in the following years aiming to infiltrate systems and access computer controls. Similarly, media reports claimed that Pakistan-based hackers had [deployed](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) malware against Indian government and defense sectors, attempting to gain access to sensitive information. In 2019, the cyber-attack on India’s nuclear facility, the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, was thought by some [analysts](https://www.orfonline.org/research/decoding-motives-behind-the-kudankulam-intrusion-58083) to have been perpetrated by Pakistan, though there was no public attribution. The technical attribution by cybersecurity firms [pointed](https://www.vifindia.org/sites/default/files/cyber-attack-on-kudankulam-nuclear-power-plant.pdf) to a North Korean state-sponsored entity, the Lazarus Group. This complex picture of the potential use of proxies points to the challenge of attribution in an India-Pakistan context. **The Attribution Challenge** Attribution in cyberspace is the process of identifying and assigning responsibility to threat actors behind the cyber operation or malicious activity. However, attribution is rarely straightforward because, unlike physical crimes, cyber actors can hide behind the anonymity of the internet or impersonate other computers. Threat actors can also remain in the system undetected, silently stealing information through stolen passwords or impersonation. In terms of technical challenges, the sophistication of the operation depending on capability could also make it difficult to trace the crime back to an actor. For instance, during the India-Pakistan crisis in May, the Indian cyber agency, Maharashtra Cyber, reported a significant surge in cyber-attacks [originating](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-sindoor-and-india-pakistans-escalated-rivalry-cyberspace#:~:text=noted%20a%20surge%20in%20DDoS,in%20these%20cyberattacks%20as%20it) from Pakistan as well as countries like Indonesia, Morocco, and Bangladesh. Threat actors using the location of a third country is often a deliberate and popular tactic to confuse the perpetrator’s identity and origin, as an IP address is usually the first source of identification. A popular global example is the 2018 [Olympic Destroyer cyberattack in South Korea](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/olympic-destroyer/21494/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20the,uproar%20was%20no%20laughing%20matter.), when the [Russian threat actors](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/) used sophisticated tactics to conceal their identity, enabling the blame to be deflected to North Korea and China. Thus, even if one actor might visibly be responsible, there might be someone else behind the keyboard. Moreover, technical attribution requires advanced threat intelligence capability, without which attribution could be erroneous and enable “false flag” categorization. For example, recently, Russian state-linked cyber group Turla allegedly attempted to access data exfiltrated from Indian military networks. Threat intelligence by Microsoft and Lumen’s BlackLotus Labs indicate that Turla [compromised a network](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) of Pakistan-based group SideCopy to spy on the Indian network. This created a false impression, shifting the blame towards Pakistan. This reiterates that the use of sophisticated techniques in an operation and the lack of advanced capability for forensic analysis can potentially obscure a threat actor’s identity, making attribution a challenge. Even advanced nations struggle with having requisite forensic capacity, so relatively newer cyber entrants like India and Pakistan will have to invest more efforts in this space. The key legal challenge India and Pakistan face regarding attribution is the lack of a transparent, and credible attribution framework. Unlike some countries, India and Pakistan do not have a formal attribution policy, making it difficult for independent analysts to assess the validity of their institutional processes. In practice, the process involves a loose [network of agencies](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/mapping-indias-cybersecurity-administration-in-2025?lang=en) coordinating technical and intelligence findings, raising concerns about the lack of consistent and verifiable evidentiary standards. It was in highlighting some of these challenges that Pakistan’s 2023 [position](https://docs-library.unoda.org/Open-Ended_Working_Group_on_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_-_(2021)/UNODA.pdf) on applicability of international law in cyberspace emphasized cross-border coordination and cooperation globally to ensure substantiated attribution. A lack of consistent evidentiary standards complicates attribution and can leave such efforts open to criticism as being politically motivated, making it critical for India and Pakistan to address this lacuna. This leads to the political challenge of attribution. The United States and [Five Eyes](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/fv-cntry-mnstrl-en.aspx) allies often attribute cyber-attacks when they need to reinforce international pressure on political adversaries or justify policy shifts. New Delhi and Islamabad have approached attribution rather cautiously. Though there are multiple reasons for this, the obvious one is to avoid jumping the gun and pointing to an adversary, which may create a particularly dangerous scenario of escalation. **Redefining Crises and Stability in South Asia** Attribution uncertainty creates costs for stability in South Asia and risks escalation in a future India- Pakistan crisis. Both countries share a hostile past and a tense strategic environment, leaving limited space for misunderstanding and miscalculation. A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing, tarnishing trust on both sides and instilling doubt. Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression. Pakistan’s 2021 Cyber Security Policy explicitly mentions that a cyberattack on critical infrastructure would be regarded as an [act of aggression](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) and be met with an appropriate response. > “A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing \\[…\\] Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression.” Another predicament is the question of proportionate response to an offensive cyber intrusion conducted by a state or state-linked threat actors without clear attribution. This is a conundrum faced by states globally, not just India and Pakistan. Determining what is a proportionate response in cyberspace currently lies at the discretion of the state. Some countries have included the principle of proportionality in formal statements unpacking how they interpret international law as applying to their conduct in cyberspace. According to its 2023 statement, while Pakistan acknowledges proportionality as applying in the context of conflict and international humanitarian law, it does not otherwise present views on response. India has not yet published a national statement. Such norms and behavior are either unaddressed or awaiting legal applicability in international frameworks. For the complicated security environment of South Asia, integration of cyber capability without legal clarity is thus worrisome. In times of active conflict, cyber operations, including information and influence operations, can create a [fog of war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQvsb4ouuI0) for decisionmakers and undermine the process of crisis management. Persistent cyber intrusions could also further compromise trust and impact and possibly backtrack the confidence-building measures (CBMs) already in place between India and Pakistan. Given that nuclear CBMs between India and Pakistan are already tenuous, a potential cyber-attack or even a data breach could be misperceived as altering the balance of power. **Policy Recommendations** To ensure that cyber does not introduce yet another element of uncertainty and that the precarious balance of power is maintained on the subcontinent, policymakers in India and Pakistan should: **_Establish a cyber hotline:_** Cyber operations can perpetuate misperception and misunderstanding, especially with attribution challenges. Therefore, rapid communication during a cyber crisis is critical. Both countries could exchange doctrines, ensure technical cooperation, and maintain a directory in case of crisis. Cyber CBMs, including hotlines and dedicated focal points for exchange, can also potentially enhance a sense of predictability. **_Support the applicability of international law to cyberspace:_** While there is consensus across the board that international law applies to cyberspace, states are still discussing how core legal principles and existing commitments, such as the non-use of force, proportionality, sovereignty, and due diligence, apply to cyberspace. Islamabad and New Delhi are advised to actively adhere to international and bilateral negotiations, such as the UN’s recently launched Global Mechanism on ICTs, successor to the Open-ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies. Pakistan published its national position paper in 2023 outlining the applicability of international law. India could follow suit, to maintain accountability and transparency. **_Commit to restraining proliferation of offensive intrusion capabilities:_** To dodge attribution and accountability, states often employ non-state APT groups to influence cyber operations. This results in proliferation of sophisticated intrusive cyber technologies and capabilities to non-state threat actors, not bound by rules and norms of state responsibility. Cyber operations through non-state APT actors help maintain plausible deniability. India and Pakistan should refrain from transferring capabilities to non-state APT groups to ensure responsible state behavior and maintain stability. **_Institutionalize attribution:_** To ensure responsible state behavior, both India and Pakistan should consider improving their attribution process. Institutionalizing the process and detailing their evidentiary standards to substantiate the findings will build confidence in their intelligence and threat assessments. Publishing a national attribution policy would explain the objectives behind disclosing a breach or attack, beyond merely aiming for political scoring. Further, both states could also benefit from investing in legal and technical capacity-building for attribution, including in collaboration with private entities and multilateral partnerships. As their decades-long hostilities spill over into cyberspace, there is likely a higher probability of cyber operations increasing in an India-Pakistan context. Realizing the serious implications of cyber threats to strategic stability, Pakistan and India are advised to seriously engage in the measures above that would reduce misperception, increase accountability and transparency, and indicate their commitments to the norms and practices of international law and responsible state behavior during conflict and peace time. _Views expressed are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the positions of South Asian Voices, the Stimson Center, or our supporters._ Also Read: [Cyber Quicksand?

Offensive capabilities are used to deny, disrupt, and degrade or destroy the adversary’s systems or networks for military or strategic purposes. However, the nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to neatly distinguish between offensive and defensive actions; some activities, like those carried out by security researchers for the purpose of testing for vulnerabilities, could be viewed as an offensive action. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Image 1: [blickpixel via Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/circuit-board-computer-chip-564814/) Image 2: [Great Norwegian Encyclopedia](https://snl.no/Kjernekraft_i_India) Posted in: [Crisis](https://southasianvoices.org/category/crisis/), [Cybersecurity](https://southasianvoices.org/category/cybersecurity/), [Escalation Control](https://southasianvoices.org/category/escalation-control/), [India](https://southasianvoices.org/category/india/), [India-Pakistan Relations](https://southasianvoices.org/category/india-pakistan-relations/), [Pakistan](https://southasianvoices.org/category/pakistan/), [Technology](https://southasianvoices.org/category/technology/) Share this: ## Subscribe to our newsletter Stay informed about the subcontinent.

By [Michael Fisher](https://www.itnews.asia/author/michael-fisher--1955979)on Oct 7, 2025 3:09PM The recent surge in cybersecurity incidents across the Asia Pacific region is now forcing a redefinition of what constitutes \"critical infrastructure.\" While energy grids, transport systems, and healthcare networks remain key targets, the latest attacks in aviation, retail, and financial services show that any network underpinning public safety, economic activity, or essential services can now be considered critical. In Australia, the Qantas breach exposed the personal information of over 5.7 million customers via a third-party system. In Singapore, nation-state actors like UNC3886 have been identified as actively targeting systems tied to national infrastructure. In India, ransomware has brought entire hospital systems and telecom providers to a standstill - disrupting care, communication, and public access. Even Google has now succumbed to a data breach. A growing concern is that this is not limited to large organisations. Cybercriminals are equally targeting small enterprises to gain access to larger corporate systems, as demonstrated by recent breaches of small to mid-size accounting and legal firms. These threats are also no longer confined to traditional IT environments, especially as digital and physical environments continue to converge. Operational Technology (OT) networks that are used to control machinery, industrial processes, and physical infrastructure are increasingly network-connected and vulnerable. Unlike IT systems, OT networks often lack built-in redundancy and can’t tolerate downtime, making them uniquely fragile in the face of modern cyber threats. > #### The increasing and high reliance on digital infrastructure across sectors like banking, retail, and logistics has elevated the criticality of their IT environments. A data centre failure or traffic outage can have the wide-ranging and same societal and economic impact as a disruption to water or energy supply. > > _- Michael Fisher, Regional Vice President, Asia Pacific and Japan, Garland Technology_ **The stakes are now higher than ever** As Singapore, India and Australia continue to digitalise core infrastructure and embrace smart systems, ensuring uninterrupted visibility across both IT and OT environments is emerging as a national priority for each country. Whether it’s a power grid in India, a port terminal in Singapore, or an airline in Australia, cyber resilience now depends on having the right architectural foundation – one that offers full visibility, supports zero-trust principles, and maintains uptime across the entire security stack. Governments and enterprises are realising the critical need for better network visibility, security and uptime that spans both digital and operational domains. This is because the next wave of attacks won't distinguish between IT and OT, so Asia Pacific organisations need to ensure their cyber defences are ready. **How can you bridge the IT–OT divide** Many organisations still depend on legacy security tools and operate without full packet visibility or the ability to monitor encrypted traffic. Even inline tools that are used to detect threats can create single points of failure if they’re not architected for continuous uptime. This vulnerability is amplified in OT, where patching or updates may require physical access to remote or sensitive facilities. A way around this lies in adopting highly resilient infrastructure that delivers real-time monitoring with zero disruption. This includes reliable network test access points (TAPs), network packet brokers, and hardware data diodes built for extreme operating conditions, along with inline bypass capabilities that ensure systems remain operational even when security tools fail or require maintenance. A good example of how this works in an organisational context is electrical utilities. As more electricity providers implement cybersecurity solutions inside substations, additional precautions must also be taken to protect infrastructure from sophisticated attacks. To address this, utilities need to look at: - Implementing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that passively monitors network traffic. - Ensuring that malicious code does not gain access to a substation’s network through the use of cost-effective hardware diodes and data diode TAPs. These provide an additional layer of security before connecting an IDS to a SPAN/Mirror port on a network. For example, a hardware data diode enforces unidirectional data flow so that information flows from sensitive environments, such as critical infrastructure, without the possibility of inbound threats. This one-way communication preserves the integrity of secure zones. There are situations where the use of SPAN/Mirror ports is still needed to connect the IDS to the substation’s network. In these instances, it is best practice to connect a hardware data diode between the SPAN/Mirror port and the IDS to pass the mirrored data onto the IDS sensor. This is because hardware data diodes eliminate bidirectional traffic flow, ensuring that no data is passed back into the Switch’s SPAN/Mirror port. In utilities and other key infrastructure, the use of inline bypass solutions is crucial in enabling organisations to update, test or maintain inline cybersecurity tools without taking them offline and risking exposure to potential cyberattacks. Inline bypass tools are also designed to ensure full network traffic visibility while minimising disruption during system updates and maintenance. With the line between what is and isn’t critical infrastructure continuing to blur, one thing is clear: future-readiness demands full-spectrum visibility, operational uptime, and the resilience to respond to the unexpected. The question that C-level executives of Asia Pacific organisations must now be prepared to answer confidently is whether their IT architecture is resilient enough to withstand a sophisticated cyberattack. _Michael Fisher is the Regional Vice President Asia Pacific and Japan, Garland Technology_ To reach the editorial team on your feedback, story ideas and pitches, contact them [here](mailto:editors@itnews.asia). © iTnews Asia Tags: [garland technology](https://www.itnews.asia/tag/garland-technology) [security](https://www.itnews.asia/security) ### Most Read Articles [**Malaysia secures communications for the upcoming ASEAN Summit**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/malaysia-secures-communications-for-the-upcoming-asean-summit-621220) [**Indonesia's national data centre suffers ransomware attack**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/indonesias-national-data-centre-suffers-ransomware-attack-609146) [**PhilHealth estimates 13 to 20 million members affected by data breach**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/philhealth-estimates-13-to-20-million-members-affected-by-data-breach-601471) [**Ransomware gang Qilin claims attack on Japan’s Asahi breweries**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/ransomware-gang-qilin-claims-attack-on-japans-asahi-breweries-620895)",

Despite the Chinese government’s internet restrictions and eCrime crackdown, anonymized marketplaces remain central to cybercrime activity across Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ). This ecosystem provides a safe haven for Chinese-speaking actors to buy and sell stolen credentials, phishing kits, malware, and money-laundering services – processing billions in illicit transactions. At the same time, AI is transforming the ransomware economy. From AI-enhanced social engineering to automated malware development, AI is accelerating every stage of the attack chain – representing a new wave of adversaries executing Big Game Hunting campaigns against high-value organizations across APJ. **APJ eCrime Landscape Report Highlights:** Based on frontline intelligence from CrowdStrike’s elite threat hunters and intelligence analysts tracking more than 265 named adversaries, the report reveals: - **Chinese eCrime Marketplaces Evade Oversight:** Amid tightened restrictions, Chinese underground markets — including Chang’an, FreeCity, and Huione Guarantee — preserve anonymity across clearnet, darknet, and Telegram channels. This decentralized ecosystem remains a hub for Chinese-speaking actors focused on operational security (OPSEC), with Huione Guarantee alone processing an estimated $27 billion USD before its 2025 disruption. - **AI Escalates Big Game Hunting Ransomware Campaigns:** AI-accelerated ransomware on high-value targets surged, with India, Australia, and Japan among the most impacted countries. Emerging Ransomware-as-a-Service providers KillSec and Funklocker – leveraging AI-developed malware – accounted for more than 120 incidents. Top targeted sectors included manufacturing, technology, and financial services, with 763 victims publicly named on dedicated leak sites. - **Chinese-Speaking Actors Exploit Japanese Trading Accounts:** Coordinated account takeover (ATO) campaigns targeting Japanese securities platforms compromised users to artificially inflate the value of thinly traded China-based stocks. This pump-and-dump scheme, traced to Chinese-speaking threat actors, used shared phishing infrastructure to sell victim data on underground forums, including Chang’an Marketplace. - **eCrime Service Providers Industrialize Attacks:** Providers such as CDNCLOUD (Bulletproof Hosting), _Magical Cat_(Phishing-as-a-Service), and Graves International SMS (Global Spam Service) enabled scalable phishing, malware distribution, and monetization operations throughout the region. - **Remote Access Tools Target Regional Users:** Likely Chinese-speaking eCrime actors deployed tools like _ChangemeRAT_, _ElseRAT_, and _WhiteFoxRAT_ to exploit Chinese- and Japanese-speaking users through SEO poisoning, malvertising, and phishing attacks masquerading as purchase orders. “eCrime actors are industrializing cybercrime across APJ through thriving underground markets and complex ransomware operations. Simultaneously, AI-developed malware enables adversaries to launch high-velocity, high-volume attacks,” said Adam Meyers, head of counter adversary operations at CrowdStrike. “Defenders must meet this new pace of attack with decisive action, powered by AI, informed by human experience, and unified in response.” Download the [2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/resources/reports/2025-apj-ecrime-landscape-report/) to explore in-depth insights, adversary profiles, and expert strategies for defending against APJ’s evolving cyber threats. **About CrowdStrike** [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) (NASDAQ: CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, has redefined modern security with the world’s most advanced cloud-native platform for protecting critical areas of enterprise risk – endpoints and cloud workloads, identity and data.

India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA.

Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years.

Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement.

Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

Due to its geographical location, seismic risk zone and intertropical convergence point, the Indian subcontinent also faces recurring atmospheric phenomena: heavy monsoon rains, floods, episodes of high heat, drought, etc. In addition, the high population density in risk areas further aggravates the situation. The number of human casualties continues to rise, from 1 674 deaths in 2015 to 2 045 in 2019. According to the report of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the total number of people who died between 2 000 and 2 019 is 79 732. During the same period, India had reported 321 catastrophic events. It is the third country in the world in terms of the number of [natural disasters](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/natural-disasters-in-2021), behind China and the United States. According to the same report, India has suffered nearly 80 billion USD in economic losses in 20 years. ## Breakdown of natural disasters in India per type of event and nature of losses | Natural disasters | Material loss | Human loss | | --- | --- | --- | | **Floods** | 52% | 63% | 32% | | **Hurricanes** | 30% | 19% | 32% | | **Landslides** | 10% | - | 2% | | **Earthquakes** | 5% | 10% | 33% | | **Droughts** | 3% | 5% | 1% | | Total | 100% | 100% | 100% | **Source :** World Bank Some of the most frequent disasters include : **Floods** After China, India is the second country hardest hit by floods with no less than 17 of such events annually, affecting 345 million Indians. This scourge has caused a significant number of casualties and major economic damage to infrastructure, property, livelihoods and crops. Heavy monsoon rains in the eastern part of the country often cause the Brahmaputra River to overflow, with disastrous consequences. According to the 2019 Global Climate Risk Index report, floods account for 52% of the total calamities affecting India, claiming 63% of the material damage and 32% of the human losses reported as natural disasters. On an annual average, 7.500.000 hectares are flooded, and 1.600 lives are lost. **Earthquakes** The probability of an earthquake is high in India, with nearly 60% of the territory being classified as a moderate to severe seismic risk zone. According to seismologists, the Himalayas, one of the regions most exposed to earthquakes, should one day suffer a mega-shock caused by the pressure accumulated in the subsoil of the Himalayan arc. The last earthquake to date occurred in 2015. With a magnitude of 7.8, the earthquake killed 9 000 people and injured more than 20 000 others. More than 600 000 homes were also destroyed by the tremor. **Cyclones** Located in the intertropical convergence zone, the Indian subcontinent is one of the regions most affected by cyclones. Its coastline stretching over more than 8 000 kilometers accounts for nearly 10% of the world's tropical cyclones, the majority of which emerge over the Bay of Bengal and strike the east coast of India. On average, six to eight depressions form each year, two or three of which turn into tropical cyclones. A major cyclone (category 3 or more) develops every two years. In May 2020, [Cyclone Amphan](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/cyclone-amphan-15-billion-usd-of-economic-losses-in-south-asia), devastated India and Bangladesh, killing 84 people and devastating the coastal areas of both countries. It was the most powerful cyclone to hit the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 cyclone that killed 10 000 people in Odisha State (northeast India). **Heat waves and droughts** Extreme temperatures and resulting weather conditions significantly affect the health of residents and the agricultural sector. With global warming, these episodes of intense heat, more than 50 degrees, are becoming increasingly frequent. According to Indian authorities, in the last four years the country has reported no less than 4 620 deaths caused by heat waves which generally occur between March and June. The last event of this kind occurred in June 2019, claiming the lives of 50 people in 24 hours. Over the past 20 years, India has also sustained the two most severe droughts in the world. They took place in 2002 and 2015 and affected 300 and 330 million Indians, respectively. Despite the affordability of coverage and the intensity and frequency of natural events, the penetration rate of natural catastrophe insurance in India is almost nil, with less than 1% of the population contracting an insurance policy for this type of risk. For several years, the authorities have been planning to set up a national pool dedicated to natural disasters, a structure struggling to see the light of day. ## List of major natural disasters that have occurred over the last 20 years in India | Date | Place | Nature of the event | Economic losses | Insured losses | Number of fatalities | Number of affected persons | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | (in billion USD) | | **May 2020** | West Bengal | Hurricane Amphan | 13.5 | ND | 103 | 500 000 homeless | | **August 2018** | Kerala | Floods | 3.52 | 0.37 | 504 | 223 139 homeless | | **November 2015** | Chennai (Tamil Nadu) | Floods | 2.37 | 0.98 | 289 | -

These states also face heightened risks: - **Gujarat:** Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. - **Maharashtra:** Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. - **Tamil Nadu:** Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. ## **Earthquake Risks** - Urban centres like **Delhi** and **Ahmedabad** face significant earthquake hazards. - A major earthquake in the **Himalayas** or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** in Gujarat. ## **Challenges in Resilience and Insurance** - Despite the scale of economic losses, **underinsurance** remains a critical issue: - **Protection Gaps:** Over **90%** of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. - **Costliest Flood Events:** - **Mumbai floods (2005):** Losses of **$5.3 billion** (2024 prices) - **Chennai floods (2015):** Losses of **$6.6 billion** (2024 prices) ## **Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach** - Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: - **Hotspot Identification:** - Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. - Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. - **Risk Assessment:** - Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. - Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. - **Reinsurance Solutions:** - Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. - Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. ## **Conclusion** - India's rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. - The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. - By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. * * * ### **Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods?** Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. ### **Q2. When was NDMA constituted?** In December 2005, the Government of India enacted the Disaster Management Act, which envisaged the creation of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers. **Source :** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-economic-losses-natural-catastrophes-9779008/) * * * ​ ​ ​ Submit * * * ![logo](https://www.vajiramandravi.com/_next/static/media/badge_logo.5fb7c7f1.svg) © 2025 Vajiram & Ravi.

Over the years, the LAC has sparked standoffs, skirmishes and war between the two expanding nuclear powers. To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh. Despite their enduring differences, India and China largely have managed to keep their border disputes from spilling over into other aspects of their relationship, such as trade. But that may start to change. As China forges deeper ties with India's nuclear archrival, Pakistan, and as each...",

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

USAID @ The Asia Foundation LS FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE Improving Lives, Expanding Opportunities INDIA-U.S. TRIANGULAR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 01 The Asia Foundation, 2022, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey - Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. The Asia Foundation: New Delhi Disclaimer This report is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the ‘India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) at The Asia Foundation. The opinions expressed here are solely of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government and The Asia Foundation. 02 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Foreword India and the U.S. share a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region. India’s long\u0002standing engagement in the region makes it a strong development partner and leader. The Asia Foundation through its India- U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a program funded by USAID, is working toward realizing this vision and strengthening India’s and the U.S.’s development cooperation footprint in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The program builds on the U.S. government’s commitment to strengthen triangular partnership programs with India in the Indo-Pacific region and is informed by the U.S. government’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and its Pacific Islands Strategy. TriDeP seeks to support the Government of India’s development assistance in the Indo\u0002Pacific region by identifying countries keen to expand their development partnership with India in sectors defined by their country needs, and by supporting programming based on such identification. Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Smart Agriculture and Renewable Energy are sectors where India demonstrates policy leadership and technical skills, and thus can provide sustainable solutions. This report presents a diagnostic study that maps India’s capabilities in disaster management, as well as identifying opportunities for India and the developing countries in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and South Asia to partner for promising solutions. Over the years, India’s disaster management approach has evolved rapidly to respond to the slew of challenges posed by a range of disasters. India’s diverse geo-climatic conditions make it vulnerable to multiple natural and human\u0002caused disasters, thus prompting the country to develop tailored policies and frameworks for coordinated multi-stakeholder disaster-risk reduction efforts. TriDeP seeks to leverage India’s know-how in disaster management, by sharing technical expertise and knowledge and supporting local adaptation, to improve resilience and preparedness against disasters in the Indo\u0002Pacific region. TriDeP aims to do this in close collaboration with a range of stakeholders, including governments, communities, and the private sector, through cost-effective and context-specific solutions. This diagnostic identifies India’s expertise in establishing well-defined institutional systems; legislative, policy and planning frameworks; robust search and rescue capabilities; improved early warning systems; technological advancements for disaster risk management; improved emergency communication; expanded disaster resource and knowledge networks; emergency operations centers; enhanced response capabilities and systems; and post-disaster mental health management. The study also identifies opportunities for India-U.S. triangular cooperation across several countries in the Indo-Pacific region. While the diagnostic study was underway, the Covid-19 virus struck with severity unimagined in a century and has brought to the fore the disastrous dimensions of pandemics, including psychological and physical health challenges that require concerted medical responses to India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 03 address them. Several participants in a virtual meeting of experts from the Indo-Pacific region to discuss the study expressed interest in the knowledge and expertise of India in psychosocial care and telemedicine health services, both important focus areas that help to address pandemic-related health issues. I would like to thank Balaji Singh Chowhan, who is the lead author and researcher for this report and an expert in disaster managenment. I would like to thank Veena Reddy, USAID/ India and Bhutan Mission Director; Karen Klimowski, Deputy Mission Director; John Smith-Sreen, Director of the Indo-Pacific Office; MaryTyler E. Holmes, Deputy Director of the Indo-Pacific Office; Sukanya Banerjee, Development Partnership Adviser and the Activity Manager for TriDeP; and Arun Sahdeo, Project Management Specialist (Disaster Risk Management) for their support to the program and their valuable inputs and suggestions that enhanced the quality of the report. Our thanks to all the technical experts from the disaster management sector in India, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Island countries for their participation in the research, valuable insights, and contributions to the study. At The Asia Foundation, we would like to thank Anthea Mulakala, Senior Director for International Cooperation for her guidance during the study. Atul Kaushik, TriDeP Chief of Party, led the planning and execution of the diagnostic, ably assisted by Malavika Thirukode, Program Officer. Ramesh Navaladi, Deputy Chief of Party and Ajay Singh, Monitoring, Evaluation, Learning and Adaptation Specialist, each made valuable contributions to the report’s approach and content. Aparna Achuthan, Program Officer, made valuable contributions to finalizing the report, and Suzan Nolan from BlueSky International contributed to the editing of the report. I hope the findings from this report will pave the way for strengthening India’s and the U.S.’s approach to triangular partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region.

Sen Pilgrims being rescued from Badrinath after the 2021 Uttarakhand flood. 10 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey I ndia, due to its unique geo-climatic conditions, is vulnerable to multiple natural and human-caused disasters, such as droughts, floods, earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, hailstorms, cold waves, heat waves, glacier lake outburst floods, wildfires, oil spills, and other major pollution events. The country’s journey toward holistic and modern disaster risk reduction (DRR) practices began more than 20 years ago, when several natural disasters resulted in thousands of deaths and enormous economic losses. These disasters spurred India toward a more comprehensive DRR approach, eventually leading the country to tremendous disaster management progress: Subsequent disasters have resulted in minimized deaths and losses because of India’s effective DRR efforts. Over the course of the past two decades, India’s disaster management approach evolved from a reactive, search-and-rescue, and relief-centered approach primarily centered on flood and drought to a proactive, holistic approach that includes prevention, mitigation, preparedness, capacity building, risk reduction, technological investment and advancements, community involvement, and risk resilience for a far wider range of hazards. Holistic disaster management requires mainstreaming DRR into policies, institutions, infrastructure, and logistics in order to develop tools for effective and efficient action. India developed DRR policies for multiple stakeholders by integrating inputs from domain experts and all levels of governments and communities; it also increased response effectiveness through international coalitions, and coordinated risk reduction capabilities at the national and local levels. India’s holistic DRR efforts involve robust legal frameworks; effective policy design and development; domestic policy and institutional coherence; a focus on capacity building, expert input, and knowledge sharing; well-oiled administrative mechanisms; an ability to prevent or mitigate disasters before they occur, as well as effective and inclusive rescue and recovery operations. India’s disaster management learning curve owes a great deal to how India adapted crucial disaster management elements from other countries to India’s own context. Now, other countries have the opportunity to emulate India’s DRR journey in order to accelerate their own efforts, thereby saving thousands of lives and millions in economic losses. India has multiple bilateral and multilateral DRR relationships with other countries, such as the United States, Switzerland, Australia, Russia, the European Commission, and United Nations agencies. Given this international cooperation framework already in place and India’s extensive DRR capabilities, it would be hugely beneficial for India to branch out to additional triangular cooperation (TrC) initiatives, especially partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which already has a strong DRR backbone with India. These TrC initiatives would be led by India as the primary source of expertise and technical assistance and could also benefit from the involvement of several United States agencies and private-sector or nongovernmental organizations. India’s South-South development cooperation model would thus be considerably enhanced, with the triangulation of efforts between India and the United States increasing India’s development assistance footprint in the developing countries of the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. This report begins with an explanation of India’s 20-year journey from search and rescue\u0002related crisis management to prevention, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 11 mitigation, and preparedness, setting the groundwork for how India’s experiences can be adapted to other countries’ own disaster management contexts. The second chapter details the interplay between India’s DRR strategy, legislation, policy interventions, disaster management administration and institutions, and its perspectives on gender equity and social inclusion in DRR efforts. Chapter three breaks down how India can share its knowledge and DRR capabilities through the country’s multiple DRR technologies and capacity-building institutions, including centers of excellence for training in general disaster management and early warning systems; specialized institutions for search and rescue and disaster assessment, mitigation, and planning; private- and nongovernmental organization\u0002run training institutes; Incident Command System adaptations; risk communication and language adaptations; and equipment stocks and suppliers. The fourth chapter outlines the DRR status of three Indo-Pacific sub-regions: South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indo-Pacific Islands, and briefly discusses the potential DRR needs of ideal TrC partners. Chapter five concludes with a discussion about the viability of TrC initiatives, and makes recommendations for suitable TrC activities in 10 Indo-Pacific countries. About the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) India, The Asia Foundation is implementing the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a three-year program in support of the United States’ and India’s mutual aims in the Indo\u0002Pacific Region. In a ground-breaking initiative to catalyze North-South-South triangular cooperation (TrC) throughout an entire region – the Indo-Pacific – rather than with a single country, the TriDeP program will facilitate partnerships between India, the United States, and several South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Indo-Pacific Island countries.1 The TriDeP program has identified three priority areas where India can share its proven expertise: disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate-smart agriculture, and renewable energy. The TriDeP program team selected DRR for its inaugural research initiative to explore how and where India’s demonstrated DRR policy leadership, practical experience, and sustainable results can be shared with countries in the region. After assessing India’s DRR capacities and capabilities and matching them to the needs and capabilities of potential Indo-Pacific partner countries, the TriDeP program will develop demand-driven, context-specific TrC projects that combine Indian experience and Photographer: Saikiran Kesari Stranded citizens making their way through the flooded streets of Mumbai, India during the 2020 Mumbai floods. 12 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey expertise with Indian and American technical assistance, drawing on India’s centers of excellence, training institutions, relevant private sector entities, and nongovernmental and civil society organizations. Research Objectives The TriDeP program team undertook action research on India’s DRR institutions and capabilities in order to understand the Indian\u0002Indo-Pacific DRR landscape, identify DRR needs in potential beneficiary countries, highlight areas of India’s DRR expertise that could be shared, suggest priority partners and projects for initial TrC implementations, and determine suitable activities to support project design and implementation. Research Methodology The action research for this report took place from January through June 2021. The research process began with a thorough review of the literature followed by nine telephone and seven in-person interviews with 16 Indian government representatives, technical specialists, and practitioners experienced in DRR and disaster management in order to gain a preliminary overview of India’s current capabilities – what we will call the “supply-side” of DRR (see Annexure 1 for participant list). The study also involved extensive desk research to gather background information about India’s supply-side capabilities. The supply-side research also involved convening a group of 17 experts from India, including independent DRR experts, leaders of DRR civil society organizations (CSOs) working in India, and current and retired government functionaries who lead or have led India’s disaster responses. These experts were joined by six supporting Photographer: Dr. Ashok K A Doppler Radar meteorological geodesic dome atop a hillock at Vishakhapatnam, India. India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 13 staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 2 for participant list). The supply-side research was complemented by what we will call “demand-side” desk research about Indo-Pacific countries’ geographies and their disaster exposures, histories, institutional and technical capabilities, current disaster\u0002aid partnerships, and relevant socioeconomic profiles. The desk research was enhanced through discussions with a group of 39 experts in the fields of DRR and climate change impacts; these experts represented countries, states, or organizations from Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Germany, India, Nepal, United Kingdom, United Nations, United States, and international nongovernmental and civil society organizations. These experts were joined by seven supporting staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 3 for participant list). The demand-side experts discussed DRR needs as perceived by countries in the region, identified geopolitical interests or sensitivities, and postulated supply-demand matches. Since Covid-19 pandemic restrictions prevented in-person meetings, both supply- and demand-side convenings took place online and lasted about two hours each. During the demand-side convening, the Covid-19 pandemic prompted requests from some Indo-Pacific countries for assistance with health- and psychosocial-care needs to combat and counter the effects of the pandemic. Although the TriDeP team did not focus on pandemic disasters in the initial research phases, this report describes some of India’s supply-side telemedicine and psychosocial-care capabilities that could match demand-side requests for pandemic- and other health-related cooperation projects. Drawing on the desk research, interviews, and discussions with the TriDeP program team, and his own extensive experience in the field and personal familiarity with the actors, the author identifies 10 countries as potential TrC candidates and indicates their potential needs for equipment, services, and technical assistance that would increase the effectiveness of disaster risk management and response. In his selection of potential match countries, the author also considered complementary and competing DRR programs and activities already in progress with other providers. The author cautions, of course, that all DRR assistance proposals should align with host government priorities and that all recommended disaster management solutions must be fine-tuned and based on further contextual analyses. Pertinent facts about the 10 potential match countries and possible TrC initiatives are detailed in Annexure 4, which covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Fiji, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Maldives, the Philippines, Nepal, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. In addition, the author presents disaster risk profiles for 16 other Indo-Pacific Region countries that may become candidates for TrC in the future: Brunei, Cook Islands, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, and Vanuatu (Annexure 5). The author’s TrC recommendations are consistent with the Intermediate Result (IR) 3.1 of the USAID India Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS).2 The Asia Foundation is a non-profit international development organization committed to improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia. Informed by six decades of experience and deep local expertise, its work across the region addresses five overarching goals – strengthen governance, empower women, expand economic opportunity, increase environmental resilience, and promote international cooperation. The TriDeP creates an opportunity for The Asia Foundation to examine emerging cross-cutting critical issues, such as disaster risk reduction, that warrant deeper investigation to inform its program strategies to ensure the Foundation remains at the leading edge of changing dynamics in the regional context – geopolitical, environmental, and legal/regulatory – and well-positioned to tackle the most critical issues facing Asia.

To be effective, all these elements must come together as a seamless whole. The policies, institutions, and logistics of disaster management are as important as the actual equipment used to rescue people – absolutely vital in handling disasters, in reaching to the last mile, and in determining the tools for effective and efficient action. Equally important is the involvement of disaster management practitioners in policy design and development – the domain and subject matter experts who understand the complexity and who know how to make disaster management policies, institutions, and logistics work together most effectively. Effective disaster management usually requires a long phase of development; time is the main challenge in setting up vital elements. Experts see India’s present disaster management approach as a journey that lasted just over two decades. It began at the time of super Cyclone Photographer: Fernando Quevedo de Oliveira Forest fires above Thak village in Uttarakhand, India in May, 2016. 16 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey ‘The Government of India and other stakeholders implemented recommenda- tions from a High Powered Committee (HPC). ‘The HPC’s report guided India’s disaster managernent approach from a relief-centric approach to one that embrac- es prevention, mitigation, and preparedness. fo strengthen India’s approach, the HPC. also made other recommendations: linking development efforts to disaster reduction; estab- lishing a disaster knowledge network, promoting interna- tional cooperation; applying a national disaster mitigation strat adopting a commu- nity-based approach; and fostering a culture of preven- tive thinking, The enactment of the National Disast ment Act and the de lop- ment of a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and state- and district-level disaster n ‘ nt authorities (SDMAs and DDMAs) set the stage for India’s National Institute m of Disaster Management (NIDM) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 17 The National Policy on Disaster Management (2009) motivated community-based disaster management, last-mile integration of policy and plans, executional capacity development, consolidation of past initia- tives, deployment of best prs agencies at national and tices, cooperation with international levels, and multi-sectoral synergies. First announced in Novem- ber 2016 during the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, the Prime Minister's Ten Point Agenda restated DRR priorities, such as bolstering local capacities, enhancing, knowledge networks, and supporting international coalitions. The 2016 National Disaster Management Plan, subse- quently updated in 2019, provided a [ramework for disaster management plans at the ministerial, depart mental, state, and district levels. The Plan set out mechanisms for multiagency coordina- tion: the National Executive Committee (NEC), headed by the Ministry of Home Affairs Secretary at the national level, and the State Executive headed by a Chief Secretary mmiittee, at the state-government level.",

    "full_text": "# Japan and India seeing highest cybercrime activity in APAC: Microsoft Digital Defense 2025 report _Government agencies and services as well as IT companies are also the sectors most targeted by cyberthreats in 2025._ According to [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report 2025](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/cybersecurity/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2025/), nation-state threat actors have evolved their cyber and influence operations. Leveraging AI, nation-state actors remain focused on intelligence collection and public perception manipulation, shaping conflict narratives and flooding the information space with synthetic media to desensitize audiences and exhaust detection systems. Amy Hogan-Burney, Corporate Vice President, Customer Security & Trust at Microsoft explained in a [blog post](https://news.microsoft.com/source/emea/2025/10/middle-east-extortion-and-ransomware-drive-over-half-of-cyberattacks/) that “threat actors are using AI to boost their attacks by automating phishing, scaling social engineering, creating synthetic media, finding vulnerabilities faster, and creating malware that can adapt itself. Nation-state actors, too, have continued to incorporate AI in their cyber influence operations. This activity has picked up in the past six months as actors use the technology to make their efforts more advanced, scalable, and targeted.” Looking at cybercrime activity in the region, Japan and India recorded the most cybercrime activity APAC, with the Philippines the most targeted ASEAN nation in 7th place. Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam are also among the top 10 countries in APAC affected by increasing cybercrime. Interestingly, the report revealed cyberattacks remain by and large financially motivated with extortion; ransomware, and data theft are primary attack motivations. Espionage accounts for only 4% of attacks. Government agencies and services as well as IT companies are also the sectors most targeted by cyberthreats in 2025. While espionage only accounted for 4% of cyberattacks, Hogan-Burney pointed out that nation-state actors still target key industries and regions, expanding their focus on espionage, and in some cases on financial gain. She highlighted geopolitical objectives driving a surge in state-sponsored cyber activity, with a notable expansion in targeting communications, research and academia. For example, she stated that China is continuing its broad push across industries to not only conduct espionage and steal sensitive data but have also become faster at operationalizing newly disclosed vulnerabilities. She added that Iran is going after a wider range of targets than ever before, from the Middle East to North America, as part of broadening espionage operations while Russia has expanded targets and North Korea remained focused on revenue generation and espionage. “Amid the growing sophistication of cyber threats, one statistic stands out: more than 97% of identity attacks are password attacks. In the first half of 2025 alone, identity-based attacks surged by 32%. That means the vast majority of malicious sign-in attempts an organization might receive are via large-scale password guessing attempts. Attackers get usernames and passwords (“credentials”) for these bulk attacks by in large from credential leaks,” said Hogan-Burney. She also highlighted the surge in the use of infostealer malware by cybercriminals. Infostealers can secretly gather credentials and information about online accounts like browser session tokens, at scale. Hogan-Burney said cybercriminals can then buy this stolen information on cybercrime forums, making it easy for anyone to access accounts for purposes such as the delivery of ransomware. In mid-2025, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, working with the U.S. Department of Justice, Europol, and Japan’s Cybercrime Control Center, carried out a landmark disruption operation against Lumma Stealer, the most prevalent infostealer observed between October 2024 and October 2025. The sophisticated malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platform retrieve sensitive data from various browsers and applications, such as cryptocurrency wallets, which is then sold to access brokers through dark web forums and Telegram channels. Over 2,300 malicious domains were seized or blocked, cutting off Lumma’s infrastructure and redirecting infected devices away from criminal control. Despite this, organizations still need to take the highest measures when it comes to their cybersecurity. As cybercriminals are leveraging AI, businesses also need to see how they can best boost their defenses. “Defensive measures alone are not enough to deter nation-state adversaries. Governments must build frameworks that signal credible and proportionate consequences for malicious activity that violate international rules. Encouragingly, governments are increasingly attributing cyberattacks to foreign actors and imposing consequences such as indictments and sanctions. This growing transparency and accountability are important steps toward building collective deterrence. As digital transformation accelerates—amplified by the rise of AI—cyber threats pose risks to economic stability, governance, and personal safety. Addressing these challenges requires not only technical innovation but coordinated societal action,” she concluded.",

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana.

The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions.

The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism.

He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

Four of the sites were reportedly located in Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, with the remaining five located in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Local media reports claim India's military used air assets to deploy standoff weapons, including SCALP/Storm Shadow cruise missiles and AASM HAMMER smart missiles, as well as loitering munitions to target alleged militant infrastructure.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

Some of the most violent attacks conducted by the Naxalites have been against police transport and freight trains, killing dozens of people at a time. The Naxalites specifically inhabit an area known as the \"Red Corridor,\" which stretches from West Bengal state southwest to Karnataka state. The most violent states in this corridor have been Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Orissa. The region is defined by rolling hills covered in dense forest and has few improved roads, which allows the Naxalites to control access. The dense foliage also protects them from government aircraft. This Stratfor map shows the areas in India where Naxalite militants operate.",

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

    "full_text": "1 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 COUNTRY UPDATE: I UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 October 2024 By Sema Hasan, Senior Policy Analyst Increasing Abuses against Religious Minorities in India Introduction Religious freedom conditions in India have continued to worsen throughout 2024, particularly in the months prior to and immediately following the country’s national elections. In addition to the enforcement of discriminatory state-level legislation and propagation of hateful rhetoric, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government made a concerted effort to implement election promises that negatively and disproportionately impacted religious minorities and their ability to practice their faith. Such promises included enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), inaugurating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and introducing a national code to replace religion-specific personal laws. Each action was justified by government officials as necessary to protect India’s “cultural [and] linguistic heritage”—a common euphemism for Hindu supremacy, often at the expense of religious minorities. This report provides an overview of the various religious freedom violations that have taken place in India during 2024. It focuses on changes to the country’s legal framework, including the strengthening of discriminatory legislation like state-level anti-conversion and anti-terrorism laws, as well as the implementation of the CAA and the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). It also examines the increasing frequency of attacks against religious minorities and their advocates, including the targeting of places of worship. Laws and Other Challenges to Religious Freedom at the National Level The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) In May 2024, the Indian government published the rules for implementing the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), fulfilling a long-anticipated BJP campaign promise. Amending the country’s 1955 Citizenship Act, the CAA established a religious criterion for fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants (from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, or Christian communities) fleeing neighboring Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The law excludes Muslim refugees, including Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka. The act states that an individual must have lived or worked in India prior to December 31, 2014, in order to apply for citizenship. www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov Stephen Schneck Chair Eric Ueland Vice Chair Commissioners Mohamed Elsanousi Maureen Ferguson Susie Gelman Vicky Hartzler Asif Mahmood Meir Soloveichik Erin D. Singshinsuk Executive Director USCIRF’s Mission To advance international freedom of religion or belief, by independently assessing and unflinchingly confronting threats to this fundamental right. 2 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Critics argue that the CAA violates the Indian constitution’s principles prohibiting religious discrimination and its guarantees of equal protection under the law. Mass protests followed the initial announcement in 2019, in which hundreds were injured and thousands arrested—some of whom remained in detention as of September 2024, including Umar Khalid, Meeran Haider, and Sharjeel Imam. The recent announcement of the implementation rules initiated a surge of new protests as well as a number of petitions challenging the CAA before the Supreme Court. Several Indian states have expressed opposition to the CAA. In 2019, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh all moved resolutions against the CAA. In February 2024, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu stressed that he would not allow implementation of the CAA in that state, as he would “stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan brethren.” Similarly, in March, the chief minister of West Bengal voiced her opposition to the act, arguing that it would be used to “turn legal citizens into foreigners.” Kerala was the first state to legally challenge the CAA and in March renewed its 2020 plea before the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the law’s classification based on religion and country is discriminatory. In June, the Madhya Pradesh government granted Indian citizenship to three applicants under the CAA. National Register of Citizens (NRC) Human rights advocates argue that the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in combination with the CAA, would allow the Indian government to expel those it deemed noncitizens, posing particular risk to the country’s Muslim population. The government first piloted the NRC in Assam in 2018, when it sought to separate Indian citizens from “undocumented immigrants” living in that state. The NRC requires residents to prove they or their ancestors had entered Assam prior to March 24, 1971, or face exclusion from the register. In 2019, the Assam government published its list of names of those it considered Indian citizens according to the NRC, omitting 1.9 million names. Of these 1.9 million, an estimated 700,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Bengali Hindus, and 200,000 were from the Assamese Hindu groups Koch-Rajbongshi, Das, Kalita, and Sarma. In July 2024, the Assam government ordered police to cease referring people entitled to Indian citizenship— under the CAA—to Foreigners’ Tribunals, which function as quasi-judicial bodies that authorities task with determining whether an individual is a “suspected foreigner.” Despite this order, police in Assam that same month, in conjunction with the Foreigners’ Tribunals, declared 28 Muslims as “non-citizens” and sent them to a deportation center. In September, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that all individuals must submit an NRC application in order to receive identity cards. New Delhi India USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 3 Expropriation and Demolition of Places of Worship and Muslim Property Since the beginning of 2024, Indian authorities have facilitated the expropriation of places of worship, including the construction of Hindu temples on the sites of mosques. Most notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in January, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Indian authorities had constructed the temple atop the ruins of the Babri Masjid, which a Hindu mob had demolished in 1992 in their belief that it marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site was long contested; India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the mosque’s destruction was an “egregious violation” of the law and yet granted the site to Hindus while offering Muslims a separate plot of land to construct a new mosque—which remains unbuilt as of September 2024. The days following the temple’s January 2024 consecration were marked by a series of attacks and other instances of intolerance against religious minorities across six states. In each instance, violence erupted following Hindu nationalist processions through predominantly Muslim neighbors. In Maharashtra, violence broke out along Mira Road, where police stood by as mobs vandalized dozens of Muslim-owned shops. Several reports indicate that the police arrested Muslim youths, despite receiving dozens of complaints against the actions of the Hindu mob. In the aftermath of the Mira Road violence, municipal authorities returned with bulldozers to demolish structures they deemed illegal. Commonly referred to as “bulldozer justice,” state authorities have repeatedly used bulldozers to demolish Muslim property under the guise of removing “illegal” structures, including homes, businesses, and places of worship. In February, for example, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the 600-year-old Akhoondji Mosque, alleging that the building was an illegal encroachment. The mosque’s imam argued that he did not receive written notice before the demolition. The DDA has also announced its intention to demolish 20 religious structures in the forested areas of Sanjay Van, including 16 Muslim shrines. A court order claimed that Delhi “already had sufficient dargahs and temples” and that the forest needed restoration. The same month, in Uttarakhand, the demolition of a mosque and Muslim seminary by police and government officials sparked deadly clashes and an internet shutdown. In July, the DDA demolished the Faizyab Mosque and Madrassa in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area. Places of Worship Act Beyond demolitions, the government has expropriated several mosques for alternative purposes, directly violating India’s Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. The 1991 act froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed in August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith. While the act does not apply to the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, it extends protection to all other places of worship. Despite this law, an Indian court ruled in February that Hindus can worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, which Hindus claim rests on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The same month, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav called for the repeal of the Places of Worship Act, calling it “unconstitutional.” Waqf Amendment Bill In addition, many Muslims have expressed concern regarding the Indian government’s introduction of the Waqf Amendment Bill in August, which seeks to repeal the 1995 Waqf Act. A waqf is an endowment (movable or immovable) that Muslims can give for a specific pious or charitable purpose, according to Islamic tradition. Once registered as a waqf, such property—which may include land, graveyards, or buildings—is deemed nontransferable and held in perpetuity as such. All mosques in India are considered waqf properties, under the management of Muslim bodies in every state, known as Waqf Boards. The 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to broaden the government’s regulatory authority over these endowments and proposes the mandatory inclusion of non-Muslim members on Waqf Boards. It also seeks to prohibit the designation of a given property as a waqf based on its owner’s oral declaration alone. Legal experts and Muslim leaders argue that these provisions would erode their community’s autonomy over its own religious institutions. The introduction of this legislation follows the increased proliferation of disinformation regarding the distribution of wealth among India’s Muslim communities, including derogatory comments that Prime Minister Modi made during the national election. 4 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 State and Local Laws Impacting Religious Minorities Uniform Civil Code and Personal Status Laws Since 2019, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have articulated their intention to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to overrule existing personal laws that are highly integrated with religious beliefs. Such personal laws include areas such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession. Critics argue that a UCC would contradict secular principles while failing to adequately represent the needs and values of the country’s myriad and diverse religious communities. In February, the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand passed a state-level UCC bill, establishing a uniform set of rules on personal status law that includes marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. This bill is widely considered to represent a template for other states to adopt. The UCC sets the minimum age for marriage at 18. While Hindu and secular laws set age restrictions for men and women, there are no such limitations for Muslims and other communities. Some Muslim communities have characterized the UCC as a threat to Islamic practices, preferring to observe Shari’a as the basis for personal law, and some Sikh organizations have similarly rejected it, arguing that it “undermines Sikh identity.” The UCC further requires “live-in” relationships to be registered within a month and establishes criminal punishments, including six months in jail, for failing to do so. Such provisions would allow for further policing of interfaith couples, who already face risks including threats of violence from family members. In July, for example, the Uttarakhand high court directed police to provide protection to an interfaith couple in a live-in relationship and instructed them to register under the UCC. The couple reported receiving threats from their parents about their relationship. Anti-Conversion Laws In addition to the UCC and other legislation, authorities frequently used state-level policies throughout the first part of 2024, including anti-conversion laws, to target religious minorities across India. As USCIRF previously reported, 12 of India’s 28 states currently maintain anti\u0002conversion laws and enforce them to varying degrees. These laws prohibit conversion under circumstances that far exceed cases of coercion, and they are often punishable by hefty fines and prison terms. Authorities frequently enforce such laws under the pretext of preventing so-called “love jihad”—a conspiracy theory that claims Muslim men target and seduce Hindu women for conversion to Islam—while in effect targeting interfaith relationships. Since the beginning of the year, authorities have arrested dozens of Christians on allegations of conducting or participating in forced conversions. In June, for example, police in Uttar Pradesh detained 13 Christians, including four pastors; in July, seven Christians faced accusations of violating the state’s anti-conversion law in two separate incidents. That same month, government officials from Uttar Pradesh tabled a bill that would strengthen the state’s anti-conversion law, including expanding the punishment for conversion to life imprisonment, allowing anyone to file a First Instance Report (FIR) against suspected violators, and making religious conversion a nonbailable offense. Several other states made similar efforts to introduce or strengthen existing anti-conversion laws. In February, for example, the state of Chhattisgarh announced it would introduce legislation to address “illegal conversion,” claiming that Christian pastors had forcibly converted Hindus. In February, the Assam government passed the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Bill, which bans individuals or groups from performing “non\u0002scientific” healing, such as prayer, to treat illnesses. The chief minister of Assam further noted his intention to restrict Christian evangelism and conversion in the state with the bill. In April, the government of Gujarat issued a circular mandating that Hindus wishing to convert to Buddhism, Sikhism, or Jainism obtain approval from their district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. In June, the BJP-led government in Rajasthan withdrew its 2008 anti-conversion law in favor of new legislation aimed at “curbing alleged cases of ‘love jihad’” and religious conversion. Additionally, as of August, appeals challenging the constitutionality of anti\u0002conversion laws were pending in seven states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Anti-Cow Slaughter Laws India’s constitution directs states to take steps to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, considered sacred in Hinduism. As a result, 20 of India’s 28 states currently enforce anti-cow slaughter laws. Vigilante groups and self-proclaimed “cow protectors” frequently exploit such laws to target religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits. USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 5 An estimated dozen attacks involving “cow vigilantism” took place following India’s national elections in June. In August, for example, a group of cow vigilantes beat a Muslim migrant worker to death, falsely accusing him of having eaten beef. A day later, a group of Hindu men violently attacked a 72-year-old Muslim man because they believed he was carrying beef in his bag. The same month, a group of “cow protectors” shot and killed a 19-year-old Hindu student because they thought he was a Muslim smuggling cows. While arrests were made in each of these cases, perpetrators of such attacks often operate with impunity; they rarely face punishment and are often released on bail within 24 hours. Other Significant Religious Freedom Challenges across India Hate Speech, Misinformation and Disinformation In the leadup to the June 2024 elections, political officials increasingly wielded hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims and other religious minorities. Prime Minister Modi repeatedly claimed that the opposition party would “wipe out [the] Hindu faith from the country” and had plans to make Hindus “second class citizens in their own country.” He perpetuated hateful stereotypes about Muslims, referring to them as “infiltrators.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah echoed these statements and insisted falsely that opposition leaders would impose Shari’a if elected—despite the fact that the opposition election manifesto included no mention of Shari’a or Muslims. Additionally, misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech by Indian government officials frequently fuel and incite cow vigilantism and other attacks against religious minorities. The attacks against Muslims in Mira Road following the inauguration of the Ram Temple in January, for example, erupted following inflammatory speeches by two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain. Rane reportedly openly threatened the Muslim community, using offensive language and urging the Hindu community to “ignite and retaliate.” While First Instance Reports (FIRs) were filed against Rane and Jain, Mumbai police argued in July that the use of terms like “jihadis,” “Rohingya,” and “Bangladeshis” were not aimed at the Muslim community and therefore did not fall under Section 295A of the penal code. The same month, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about an increase in hate speech targeting Rohingya refugees and the Indian government’s role in arbitrary mass detention and forcible return of that community to Burma. Following Rane and Jain’s speeches, BJP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) T. Raja Singh gave a 40-minute speech in February stoking religious tensions, in which he openly called for violence against Muslims and for the further demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura. Singh claimed that Muslims were facilitating the forceful conversion of Hindus and repeatedly referred to Rohingya and Bangladeshi Muslims as “illegal.” He encouraged his audience to be “prepared to fight for the protection of our country and religion” and to fight against “love jihad,” forced conversion, and cow slaughter. Attacks against Religious Minorities In March, a group of UN experts raised alarm about the level of violence and hate crimes against religious minorities in the leadup to national elections, including vigilante violence, targeted and arbitrary killings, demolition of property, and harassment. They called on the Indian government to fulfill its obligation to prohibit religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and violence. From January to March 161 incidents of violence against Christians in India were reported—47 of which occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh. Such incidents ranged from violent attacks on churches and prayer meetings to physical assaults, harassment, and false allegations of forced conversion. Muslims continued to be targeted, as well. In March, a group of Hindus in Gujarat violently attacked foreign Muslim university students as they gathered for prayer during Ramadan. The university subsequently issued new guidelines, instructing students not to pray in common spaces. Moreover, following the election results, during which the BJP lost its national majority, at least 28 attacks against Muslims occurred from June to August. Religious educational institutions were also subjected to harassment and targeting. In February, for example, Hindu organizations entered a Catholic school in Assam and demanded instructors cease using Christian images and symbols. In March, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment striking down a previous ruling on the governance of madrasas, effectively banning Islamic schools in that state and ordering the public school enrollment of students whom the closures had impacted. 6 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Crackdown on Civil Society and Faith-Based Organizations In 2024 the government of India has expanded its tactics of repression to target religious minorities and their advocates abroad. Journalists, academics, and civil society organizations documenting India’s religious freedom violations have reported facing denial of consular services, including the revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards as well as threats of violence and surveillance. In April, international reporting linked an official in India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to the 2023 assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist in New York. Additionally, Indian authorities have repeatedly used discriminatory legislation to target religious communities and those advocating on their behalf. Authorities continued to exploit antiterror and financing laws, including the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to crack down on civil society organizations, religious minorities, human rights defenders, and journalists reporting on religious freedom. The UAPA was enacted in 1967 but amended in 2019, allowing the government to designate individuals as “terrorists” without due process. The law vaguely defines “unlawful activity” as any action “intended to disrupt India’s sovereignty, integrity or security,” including “disruptive speech.” In 2024, several religious minorities and human rights activists have continued to face detention without trial under the UAPA, including Hany Babu and Rona Wilson. Academic and human rights activist GN Saibaba, whom authorities detained under the UAPA in 2017 for criticizing state violence against religious minorities, was ultimately released in March but described how police had abused him, tortured him, and denied him medical care while in custody. Similarly, organizations that document and advocate for religious freedom continue to face harassment and, in some cases, are forced to shut down operations. Like the UAPA, authorities have used India’s Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to obstruct the work of civil society organizations. FCRA regulates access to foreign funds for individuals and organizations and prohibits receipt of foreign funds for “any activities [deemed] detrimental to the national interest” of India. The law requires nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to apply for FCRA licenses to received foreign funding, but authorities can readily revoke such licenses. In April, India’s Home Ministry canceled the FCRA licenses of five NGOs, preventing them from using existing funds. Those NGOs included the Church of North India (CNI) Synodical Board of Social Service, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, and Evangelical Fellowship of India. In total, the Indian government has canceled over 20,000 FCRA registrations since 2012. Replacing India’s Criminal Code In July, the Indian government moved to replace its colonial-era criminal laws with three new laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA). These laws replaced the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1872 Indian Evidence Act, respectively. Human rights groups argue that the enforcement of these new laws may have exacerbated the targeting of religious minorities and their advocates. Such legislation may pose an additional threat to freedom of expression, association, and right to a free trial, particularly for religious minorities. The BNS specifically adds a new provision criminalizing “acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India” and increases the minimum punishment from three years to seven. It also expands the criminalization of the promotion of “enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion” to include electronic communications. Reporting indicates that this provision has already served as a pretext for targeting journalists who reported on an alleged mob lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh. The BNSS additionally allows for police to seek 15-day detention of an accused individual at any time before they have completed 40–60 days of the allowed remand period. UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief. Professional Staff Michael Ardovino Policy Analyst Susan Bishai Senior Policy Analyst Mollie Blum Policy Analyst Guillermo Cantor Director of Research and Policy Elizabeth K. Cassidy Senior Strategic Advisor Mingzhi Chen Supervisory Policy Advisor Patrick Greenwalt Policy Analyst Sema Hasan Senior Policy Analyst Thomas Kraemer Chief Administrative Officer Veronica McCarthy Public Affairs Associate Hilary Miller Policy Analyst Nora Morton Operations Specialist Dylan Schexnaydre Policy Analyst Scott Weiner Supervisory Policy Analyst Luke Wilson International Legal Specialist Kurt Werthmuller Deputy Director of Research and Policy Nathan Wineinger Chief of Public Affairs Jean Wu Policy Analyst Conclusion Religious freedom conditions in India continue to follow a deteriorating and concerning trajectory. The Indian government continues to repress and restrict religious communities through the enforcement of discriminatory legislation like anti-conversion laws, cow slaughter laws, and antiterrorism laws. In doing so, authorities have arbitrarily detained individuals highlighting violations of religious freedom, including religious leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, without due process—in some cases for years. Indian officials have repeatedly employed hateful and derogatory rhetoric and misinformation to perpetuate false narratives about religious minorities, inciting widespread violence, lynchings, and demolition of places of worship. In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in particularly severe religious freedom violations. This report further outlines a number of policy recommendations that the U.S. government can take to address religious freedom violations in India, including issuing targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, conditioning arms sales based on improved religious freedom conditions, and incorporating religious freedom priorities into bilateral meetings with Indian government counterparts.",

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

Until New Delhi addresses the underlying grievances spurring unrest in Kashmir Valley, its residents will continue to oppose Indian rule. (TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP/Getty Images) Kashmir is known throughout South Asia for its natural beauty, which draws visitors from far and wide. But beneath the region's alluring exterior, deep-seated grievances are beginning to jeopardize its stability. On July 8, Indian security forces killed Burhan Wani, the 22-year-old commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, a militant separatist group that calls for the India-administered portion of the region (Jammu and Kashmir) to join Pakistan. The organization's fighters regularly sustain casualties, but Wani's death set off widespread protests in the state's capital, Srinagar. In an effort to contain the situation, New Delhi temporarily shuttered at least four major Kashmiri newspapers, cut off mobile phone and internet access to the region, and imposed a curfew that has yet to be lifted. These measures have not stopped the demonstrations, however, and clashes between protesters and security forces have left more than 50 dead and 3,000 injured. New Delhi has pointed the finger at...

(PRABIN RANABHAT/AFP via Getty Images) The growing momentum of youth-led and anti-elite movements across South Asia signals that political transitions in the region are far from settled. As traditional power structures weaken, new political actors are emerging. Governments will likely face increasing pressure to demonstrate democratic accountability and deliver economic gains despite fiscal constraints, heightening the risk of policy volatility and unevenly distributed benefits. Over the longer term, these shifts could reshape the region's political order, encouraging greater popular participation and institutional reform while straining governments' capacity to maintain cohesion and deliver consistent policy outcomes.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content.

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://www.ssga.com/www.ssga.com#main-wrapper) Insights # India’s trade faces tariff shock **India’s exports face a steep 50% US tariff, triggering $4.4B in foreign outflows, sectoral earnings downgrades, and market volatility, but strong domestic investor flows and GDP growth help cushion the impact.** September 8, 20255 min read [Saketh Reddy, CFA](https://www.ssga.com/ca/en/bio.html/443502) Research Analyst, Investment Strategy & Research [Dane Smith](https://www.ssga.com/ca/en/bio.html/36253) Head of North American Investment Strategy & Research Share Download Print Under the new Trump administration, the US imposed tariffs of 10% to 50% on imports from over 80 countries. India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?
