Of these, the threat posed by Naxalism, a Maoist insurrection active in the eastern half of the country for over four decades, is the most overlooked and analytically neglected in Western academic and security circles. In the past seven years, Naxalite activity has grown in scope, breadth, and violence, in a “Red Corridor” stretching from Nepal to Tamil Nadu, and killed or displaced tens of thousands of people. By 2006, the problem was so severe that India’s Prime Minister characterized the insurgency as the greatest internal security threat ever faced by his country. Given India’s bloody history with separatist and communal violence, such a pronouncement is truly startling. This thesis undertakes an historical analysis of the Naxalite movement to assess how great a danger its current iteration truly poses, and what the implications might be for India’s continued rise. Soberingly, it finds that the insurgency is indeed stronger and more dangerous today than at any time in the past. Furthermore, while it does not pose an existential threat to the state in the same way as its counterpart in Nepal, it will prove extremely disruptive to India’s further growth and development if not swiftly and effectively countered. New Delhi’s efforts in this regard are so far unimpressive, but it is not too late to act. The United States has a vested interest in the emergence of a strong and stable India, and may be able to help its new “strategic partner” address the challenge of Naxalism’s resurgence.

PURPOSE “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problem of Naxalism is the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”1 With this startling pronouncement in April 2006, India’s Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, finally drew the West’s attention to an insurgency that had plagued his country for more than four decades, taking nearly 20,000 lives in the process.2 While the world was fixated on the violence in Kashmir, fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and intermittent bouts of Hindu\u0002Muslim sectarian violence, an archaic Maoist ideology, rejected even in the land of its birth, was growing in scope, breadth, and violence. Over the past seven years in particular, Naxalite rebels have come to control large swathes of the Indian countryside in a “Red Corridor” stretching from Nepal to Tamil Nadu and killed thousands of Indian security forces and civilians. This thesis will examine the evolution of the Naxalite threat, from its humble beginnings in 1967 to the present, to ascertain the true danger posed to India’s rise as a twenty-first century Asian power. B. IMPORTANCE Since the end of the Cold War and economic reforms in the early 1990s, India’s performance has been truly staggering. It would be difficult to overstate the key role the country is expected to assume in the global community over the coming decades. With a population of over 1.2 billion, a young, growing, and increasingly educated workforce, and persistent real GDP growth rates in the area of 8 percent over the last decade, India is emerging as a powerful driver of the world economy.3 Its demographic clout and 1 Manmohan Singh, “Prime Minister’s Speech to the 2nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of Chief Ministers on Naxalism,” (speech, New Delhi, India, April 13, 2006), Government of India Press Information Bureau, http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=17128 (accessed August 10, 2007). 2 Jane’s Information Group, “India’s Mosaic of Conflict,” Jane’s Terrorism and Security Monitor, July 14, 2004, http://www8.janes.com/ (accessed August 7, 2007). 3 Ibid. 2 political ambitions are also thrusting it increasingly into positions of international leadership, as the debate on its accession to permanent membership on the UN Security Council attests. If the twenty-first century is truly to be the “Asian Century,” India, along with China, will likely be leading the way. Since the late 1990s, India has also emerged as an increasingly important strategic partner to the United States. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, India was one of the first countries in Asia to extend its support in the Global War on Terror, offering refueling rights to U.S. ships and aircraft on their way toward Afghanistan. The strategic partnership has grown since then, most famously with the 10-year defense accord signed in 2005 and the U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation agreement of 2006.4 The United States has been assiduously cultivating a closer relationship with New Delhi, and greater military and strategic ties between the two countries are clearly important components of future U.S. foreign policy in Asia. However, India’s effectiveness as a world leader and U.S. strategic partner is contingent upon its continued internal stability and economic development. If Naxalism is as great a threat as many believe, its continuing spread will have serious negative repercussions on both fronts, to the detriment of India, the United States, and the larger world. A comprehensive examination and analysis of the phenomenon, and its potential to derail India’s development, is therefore both timely and important. C. LITERATURE REVIEW The Naxalist movement emerged in 1967 as an uprising of disaffected and disenfranchised peasants in Naxalbari, West Bengal. Given its four decade long existence, there is generally a surprising dearth of academic study on the movement. Western scholarship on insurgency in South Asia usually focuses on the conflict in Kashmir and (perhaps surprisingly) the plethora of smaller insurrections in India’s 4 Jane’s Information Group, “Sentinel Security Assessment - South Asia: India, External Affairs,” Jane’s Military and Security Assessments, April 26, 2007, http://www8.janes.com (accessed August 6, 2007). 3 Northeast.5 What little attention is paid to Naxalism is focused almost solely on the underlying causes of insurgent movements in general, treating Naxalism simply as one case in a larger group. Nevertheless, these treatments do provide valuable insight on contributing factors to the movement’s rise and persistence. There seem to be two main schools of thought on this issue. The first is that insurgencies arise out of unmet political demands, usually from a minority that feels it is being oppressed.6 The second school of thought cites economic inequality as a reason for insurgent uprising, typified by the revolts of lower class social groups against what they feel is lack of access to economic gain.7 A third, smaller body of literature stresses the importance of contributing factors, asserting that uprisings are more likely to occur where the terrain provides sanctuary to small groups that can train, equip, and educate their followers outside the reach of government forces.8 In the case of Naxalism, elements of all three theories seem to be at play, and are echoed in the literature from outside the West. Unsurprisingly, the study of the Naxalite movement is more extensive in India itself. Here, however, the problem seems to be not so much a lack of analysis, but the questionable objectivity, quality, and relevance of much of the scholarship. A few works on the early phases of Naxalite activity are extant, but many of these are biased to varying degrees, written by the movement’s sympathizers or even the Maoist revolutionaries themselves.9 Of somewhat greater objectivity are a handful of histories authored by journalists, but their scope, too, is limited to the earliest years of Naxalite 5 Lawrence E.

With respect to more recent analysis, there appears to be relatively little peer- reviewed research on the subject. In its place is a fairly large volume of study, of varying quality, from numerous interested parties and private organizations. While this situation presents a unique opportunity for original research, it also poses the challenge of separating objective, factual analysis from more biased or skewed reporting. Within this latter body of more recent literature, the vast majority of debate focuses on the causes of the current phase of Naxalite insurgency and speculation as to the most effective ways to deal with it. Broadly speaking, two groups with competing viewpoints emerge from all this contention. The first, or “law and order” camp, considers the Naxalite problem primarily a security issue. The main proponents of this point of view are security analysts and researchers like K.P.S. Gill and Ajai Sahni, many of them associated with India-based think tanks like the Institute for Conflict Management.11 While acknowledging socio-economic marginalization as a contributing factor, they view the lack of effective state and municipal policing, poor coordination of security efforts with New Delhi, and lenient policies toward Naxalite groups as the root causes of the insurgency. Citing numerous failed efforts at peace talks with what they view as an intransigent, nihilistic enemy, this group advocates strongly for the active suppression of Naxalism by force, with increased utilization of central government forces if necessary.12 10 For examples, see: Sankar Ghosh, The Naxalite Movement: A Maoist Experiment (Calcutta: Firma K.L. Mukhopadhyay, 1974); Sohail Jawaid, The Naxalite Movement in India: Origin and Failure of the Maoist Revolutionary Strategy in West Bengal 1967-1971 (New Delhi: Associated Publishing House, 1979). 11 The Institute for Conflict Management, “An Introduction,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/icm/index.html (accessed July 19, 2007). 12 Much of the literature generated by these analysts is published on the ‘South Asia Terrorism Portal.’ Organized by K.P.S. Gill, the controversial ‘supercop’ who crushed the Sikh insurgency in Punjab in the early 1990s, the SATP is a comprehensive resource for writings and analysis on terrorism and related security issues in South Asia. In particular, see: K.P.S. Gill, “Imperatives of Justice,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, April 30, 2005, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/07june25pio.htm (accessed July 20, 2007); K.P.S. Gill, “Blood Sweat and Anger,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, July 13, 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/06dailynewsjuly13.htm (accessed July 20, 2007); Ajai Sahni, “The Angry Men of Mao,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, February 4, 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/ajaisahni/dailynews&analysis13022007.htm (accessed July 20, 2007). 5 In contrast, the “development” camp views Naxalism as fundamentally the result of poverty and political disenfranchisement. Represented by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and the Asian Center for Human Rights, and think tanks such as the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, this camp takes a far more holistic attitude toward the most desirable means of combating Naxal violence.13 Stressing the need for poverty reduction, land reform, and better local governance, adherents to this line of reasoning reject government sponsored violence as a solution to the Naxalite problem except in the most extreme circumstances.14 As P. V. Ramana puts it, “If the military option were effective, then the problem should not have resurfaced after the initial Naxalbari uprising was suppressed.”15 Indeed, this group views overly aggressive action on the part of security forces as one of the contributing causes of further radicalization in the countryside. At first blush, the position of Ramana and his cohorts strikes one as an oversimplification of an extremely nuanced security situation. How, for example, is development aid supposed to be distributed if the people in the process of doing so are consistently under the threat of Naxalite attack? The same can be said, however, of the “law and order” argument, and its rather singular emphasis on the use of force to quell an insurgency that doubtless draws much support from the disaffection of the rural poor. Analysis of many prior guerrilla conflicts has certainly drawn attention to the need for addressing the underlying causes of rural discontent in order to draw support away from 13 For examples, see: Asian Centre for Human Rights, “Naxal Conflict in 2006,” Asian Centre for Human Rights Report, http://pdfdownload.bofd.net/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.achrweb.org%2Freports%2Findia% 2FAR07%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Freports%2Findia%2Fnaxal0107.pdf (accessed August 6, 2007); Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, “Left Extremism in India: Naxal Movement in Chattisgarh & Orissa,” Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Special Report 25, June 2006; http://pdftohtml.ganjalinux.org/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipcs.org%2FIPCS-Special\u0002Report-25.pdf (accessed August 6, 2007). 14 Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, “Naxalism and Internal Security in India,” Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Seminar, August 4, 2007, http://www.ipcs.org/newIpcsSeminars2.jsp?action=showView&kValue=2362 (accessed August 6, 2007). 15 Ibid. 6 the insurgent base.16 Additionally, neither group adequately examines the efficacy of previous governmental policies and responses, a rather glaring oversight if one hopes to prescribe a current course of action. Compounding the debate is disagreement on the nature of the threat currently posed by the insurgency. The “law and order” crowd focuses almost exclusively on the movement’s implications for political stability in India, but their analysis tends to be a bit shrill.17 While there has certainly been a greater level of political instability in the regions affected by Naxalism, it has tended to remain in the country’s remote rural areas. Their assertions that the ‘Red Menace’ threatens to split India in two and seriously undermine central authority seems hyperbolic, especially given the fact that the movement draws on, at the most, 10,000 - 20,000 hard-core cadres.18 The “development camp,” by contrast, tends to view the Naxalist threat primarily in terms of its humanitarian dimension. These analysts focus on the recent internal displacement of tens of thousands of rural and tribal peoples, and the atrocities committed by both Maoist rebels and the government security forces, as the insurgency’s greatest dangers.19 While this argument is emotionally compelling, it is by no means clear that this aspect of the threat represents a serious strategic problem for New Delhi in and of itself. India’s population is enormous, and the small percentage directly affected account for only marginal contributions to overall GDP.20 What seem to be greater threats are the larger economic implications of the Naxalite insurgency in the context of India’s growth and development, and its potential for further spread as the social impacts of globalization are felt throughout the country. 16 For an excellent example of this argument, see Jeffrey Race, War Comes to Long An: Revolutionary Conflict in a Vietnamese Province (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1972). 17 Ajai Sahni, “Left Wing Extremism in India: Evolving Strategies for Containment,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, October 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/ajaisahni/crpfdelhi.htm (accessed August 6, 2007). 18 Reuters, “Indian Maoist Violence,” Reuters AlertNet, June 27, 2007, http://www.alertnet.org/printable.htm?URL=/db/crisisprofiles/IN_MAO.htm (accessed August 6, 2007). 19 See the aforementioned Asian Center for Human Rights Report, “Naxal Conflict in 2006” and Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Seminar, “Naxalism and Internal Security in India.” 20 Ibid. 7 As The Economist recently noted, the five states most affected by insurgent violence account for significant mineral deposits and a majority of the nation’s energy resources.21 Also, while Naxalist expansion into the Western and Southern Deccan has received some scrutiny, no serious attention is being given to its possible spread into India’s wild Northeastern states. On initial inspection, the political stability, development level, and demography of this region appear eerily similar to those areas already afflicted by Naxalite violence.22 The fact that the Northeast also contains significant fossil fuel deposits only adds to the threat of the Maoists gaining a foothold.23 Clearly, any worthwhile examination of the dangers posed by Naxalism must take into account the changing nature of the social and economic contexts within which it operates. The analytical oversights and divergences of opinion discussed above are also reflected within the administration in New Delhi, where contradictory statements, confusion, and inconsistent policymaking characterize governmental responses to the most recent Maoist threat.24 As might be expected, these efforts have proven less than effective in countering the Naxalite problem, or even checking its growth in recent years. This manifest intellectual incoherence on the part of leaders, analysts, and policymakers has many causes, but is mainly due to a lack of perspective on the nature of the challenge confronting them. In an examination of the literature on this subject, from all the various points of view, the most striking feature is the absence of any comprehensive historical analysis of the Naxalite movement, the evolution of its organization, aims, and leadership, or how India’s own political, economic, and social development has contributed to (or ameliorated) the virulence of the movement. Given the relatively long lifespan of this 21 Economist, “India’s Politics,” Economist Intelligence Unit ViewsWire, March 19, 2007, http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8875555 (accessed August 7, 2007). 22 Cline, 126-149. 23 Jane’s Information Group, “Sentinel Security Assessment - South Asia: India, Natural Resources,” Jane’s Military and Security Assessments, April 27, 2005, http://www8.janes.com (accessed August 6, 2007). 24 P.V.

With the recent spread of Naxalite activity and the notable concern it has elicited from high levels of the Indian government, this lack of an objective, realistic, and comprehensive examination represents a significant gap in the existing literature on the subject. This thesis will aim to fill that gap. D. METHODOLOGY AND SOURCES This thesis will use the comparative case study method to analyze the evolution of the Naxalite movement and assess the danger posed by the most recent upsurge in Naxalite activity. To draw an important distinction, it will not directly address the veracity of Prime Minister Singh’s assertion that “Naxalism is the single greatest internal security challenge ever faced” by his country. Given the plethora of insurgencies and violent communal movements still active in India, such an assessment would provide enough material for several lengthy theses. Instead, the central question posed here is whether the Naxalite movement currently represents a qualitatively different, and more dangerous, challenge to Indian political stability and development than it has in the past. As mentioned previously, the Naxalite insurgency is not a new phenomenon in India, and has been a thorn in the side of the country for over four decades. Generally speaking, its history can be broken down into three distinct periods, most easily distinguished by their level of insurgent activity and violence. The first period runs from the movement’s beginning in 1967 to its temporary suppression in 1972. This era encompassed the initial organization of the Naxalite movement and the rather rapid spread from its birthplace in West Bengal to a number of other states, notably Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. The second period, from 1972 until about 1991, was notable for the ideological and physical fragmentation of the movement, and its mostly localized activity in pockets of rural India. The third period (perhaps not coincidentally contemporaneous with India’s economic reforms) runs from 1991 to the present, and is distinguished by a process of gradual consolidation, culminating in the merger of the two most powerful insurgent groups (Maoist Communist Center and the 9 People’s War Group) in late 2004.25 The years since 2000 have witnessed the most dramatic escalation in the scope, breadth, and intensity of Naxalite violence. These three periods of activity will comprise the individual cases under investigation. To assess the nature and danger of the insurgency in each era, we will examine how variations in three independent variables (the socio-economic and political milieux, internal characteristics of the Naxalite movement, and governmental response) affected the dependent variable, the overall level of threat posed by the movement. These three cases will then be compared to determine whether or not the Naxalite movement indeed represents a greater danger to India than it has in the past, what specifically that danger is, and how it is likely to develop in the future. Finally, I will explore the implications for India’s continued rise and its prospects as a strategic partner of the United States. Primary and secondary source materials are utilized to the maximum extent practical. Primary sources consist largely of internal documents from the Government of India and Naxalite organizations, as well as quotes and speeches from government and insurgent leaders. As mentioned in the literature review, there is not as much rigorous academic source material on this issue as one might like. What peer-reviewed work there is receives primacy of place, but publications and studies from interested NGOs, think tanks, and security analysts also contain valuable information, and are included in this study. Finally, significant tertiary source material, in the form of coverage from reputable news media like The Economist, Frontline (an Indian weekly), and the Times of India, is required to fill factual gaps in the existing literature. E. TERMINOLOGY ISSUES For the purposes of this thesis, the generic term Maoist will refer to the Indian variety and be used interchangeably with Naxalite. Obviously, Maoist movements and organizations exist in many forms throughout the world and there are a number of others active in South Asia, most famously in Nepal. Other than a shared political ideology and 25 P.V. Ramana, “The Maoist Movement in India,” Defense and Security Analysis 22, no. 4 (December 2006): 435-449. 10 sympathy with each other’s causes, these groups remain separate and distinct entities, and care should be taken not confuse or conflate Naxalism with other Maoist movements more generally. When referring to Maoist organizations other than the Naxalites, the full name and country of origin are provided to avoid ambiguity. 11 II. THE ORGANIZATIONAL PERIOD (1967–1972) A. INTRODUCTION To inform an assessment of the relative threat posed by the current Naxalite insurgency, this chapter will undertake an historical analysis of the movement’s organization and initial activity in the period from 1967 to 1972. This era encompasses the birth of Naxalism and its fairly rapid rise as a force on the Indian political scene, and therefore presents a potentially illuminating parallel to the resurgence of violent Maoism in recent years. It also witnessed the movement’s initial failure, and so may contain useful lessons for countering the modern threat. To begin, a brief look at the history of Indian communism is in order. For the world’s largest democracy, India has a surprisingly long and complicated relationship with Marxist ideology. First emerging in 1920, in the fires of the Indian independence movement, it has grown into a major force on the sub-continent’s political scene. While all of its proponents adhere to the ultimate goal of building a utopian classless society, they have not always agreed on the most desirable method of achieving it. Nevertheless, whether motivating an underground subversive element or an aboveground, election-contesting political party, the basic ideology has proven remarkably resilient in the Indian context. Any examination of the birth of the Naxalite movement in the latter half of the 1960s requires an understanding of its development within this larger phenomenon. Jawaid Sohail, an Indian academic studying the origins of the Naxalites, divides the evolution of the Indian communist movement into six broad periods.26 From its birth until 1941, the Communist Party of India (CPI) suffered from poor organization and leadership. Outlawed by the British colonial authorities, it languished in relative obscurity. However, when Great Britain formed an alliance with the Soviet Union following the outbreak of World War II, the communists enjoyed a new legitimacy, 26 Jawaid, 4. 12 which they exploited by allying themselves with the popular Indian National Congress from 1941-1945. After World War II, this alliance foundered on the emerging international split between East and West, and the CPI moved into opposition against the growing power of Congress in New Delhi. Around the time of India’s independence in 1947, a struggle erupted between the peasants and their ruler in the princely state of Hyderabad, which was vacillating on accession to the Indian union. Inspired by the contemporaneous example of Mao’s “People’s Revolution” in China (and encouraged by its ideological benefactor, the Soviet Union), the CPI embarked on the fourth phase of its activity, supporting an armed agrarian uprising against feudal oppression in Hyderabad that became known as the Telangana movement. In 1948, when the Indian armed forces moved in to forcibly annex the Hyderabad principality, the Telangana insurgents turned against New Delhi. While this initial struggle achieved some degree of early success, temporarily “liberating” more than 3,000 villages and 16,000 square miles of territory, a confluence of events resulted in its ultimate demise. The strength of the Indian armed forces eventually proved overpowering, and a large number of the rebels were killed. Additionally, in an attempt to curry favor with India, the Soviet Union (which had encouraged the uprising in its earlier days) summarily withdrew its support. Taking the hint, the CPI dutifully followed suit in 1951.27 The failure of Telangana inaugurated the fifth period of communist activity, when the CPI, again at Soviet urging, sought to contest national and state elections in a bid to bring about the peaceful imposition of communist rule through democratic conduct. For many of the CPI’s more radical cadres, however, this decision was viewed as a betrayal of the Party’s revolutionary heritage. The memories of Telangana loomed large in their ideological imaginings and a sizeable faction of the CPI began to drift toward a more Maoist interpretation of Marxism-Leninism as the 1950s progressed.28 27 Ajay Mehra, “Naxalism in India: Revolution or Terror?” Terrorism and Political Violence 12, no. 2 (2000): 40-42. 28 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 20-22. 13 This rise of factionalism within the CPI defines the last of Sohail’s six phases and would reach its zenith in the 1960s. With the growing Sino-Soviet split from 1958-1964, the ideological tensions within the CPI continued to mount. These were only exacerbated by the emerging Sino-Indian border dispute in the early 1960s, in which the CPI leadership came down firmly on the side of New Delhi. The pro-Chinese leftists within the party branded this policy as revisionism of the worst sort, and attempted to wrest control from the pro-Soviet faction. Unable to muster sufficient support, they instead broke away from the CPI in 1964 to form the Communist Party of India-Marxist, or CPI- (M).29 However, the CPI-(M) was almost immediately beset by the same kind of ideological infighting that had precipitated its formation. The relatively more restrained group that formed the party’s leadership, though still hostile to the Soviet Union, grudgingly embraced electoral politics as a means of bringing about a more or less peaceful revolution in India. Consequently, when the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War broke out, it quickly condemned Pakistan and its Chinese patron in an effort to capitalize on the wave of nationalist sentiment sweeping India. This tactic proved remarkably successful, and CPI-(M) candidates enjoyed surprising success in the 1967 elections in West Bengal, firmly entrenching the new party within the Indian political process. This proved to be too much for the more radical Maoist faction, and it was within this contentious milieu that the Naxalite movement was born.30 There were now three major communist strands within India: the CPI, the CPI- (M), and the violently radical Maoists. This last group, eventually named for the birthplace of their armed struggle in Naxalbari, West Bengal, would in due course form a third, underground organization, the Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist, or CPI- (ML). Unlike its progenitors, the CPI-(ML) was totally opposed to the electoral process and espoused violent revolution as the only legitimate means of realizing its political agenda. In short, this entailed nothing less than the complete overthrow of the existing 29 Dipak K. Gupta, “The Naxalites and the Maoist Movement in India: Birth, Demise, and Reincarnation,” Democracy and Security 3, no. 2 (May 2007): 166. 30 Jawaid, 76-78. 14 political structure, corrupted as it was by the four evils of “U.S. imperialism, Soviet social-imperialism, feudalism, and comprador-bureaucrat capital.”31 From 1967-1972, this group embarked on a campaign of political terror that caused no small amount of consternation to national and state governments, and resonated, at least initially, with many poor residents of West Bengal, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh. To understand why, one must appreciate India’s broader political, economic, and social contexts during this period. B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments The first seventeen years of India’s independence were marked by the political hegemony of the Congress Party, personified in the undisputed leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru.32 Under his charismatic influence, the fissiparous tendencies of India’s many ethnic, linguistic, religious, and social groups were kept in check, and the country emerged as a surprising beacon of political stability in South Asia. His passing in 1964, however, (and the subsequent death of his successor, Lal Bahadur Shastri, after only two years in power) left the Congress Party rudderless, and the leadership that had united India’s various groups under the mantle of nationalism was gone. Over the next few years, the INC embarked on a process of infighting that diminished its iron grip on political power and allowed alternative forces of social mobilization to pose new challenges to its authority.33 From 1966-1972, this drama played out at the national level in the struggle between Indira Gandhi and Morarji Desai for the position of Prime Minister and head of 31 Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist),” May 1970, reprinted in Sankar Ghosh, The Naxalite Movement: A Maoist Experiment, (Calcutta: Firma K. L. Mukhopadhyay, 1974), 190-199. 32 For outstanding one volume histories of India, see: John Keay, India: A History (New York: Grove Press: 2000);0 Stanley Wolpert, A New History of India: 7th Edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004). 33 Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952-2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 80, 94-96. 15 Congress. While Mrs. Gandhi emerged at the head of a coalition of Congress factions, the structure proved too unwieldy to contest the 1967 national elections as effectively as it had in the past. Beset by a number of economic and social crises (discussed below), Congress suffered its worst electoral performance in history, winning only 40% of the popular vote and barely hanging on to majority in a parliament it had previously dominated.34 With its attention again focused inwardly, factional battles quickly resumed. Following another disappointing performance in the mid-term elections of 1969, the party officially split into two competing camps: Congress (O) under Morarji Desai, and Congress (R) under Indira {later Congress (I)}.35 Though she still commanded a plurality in parliament, Mrs. Gandhi now had to rely on a coalition of leftist parties to give her a working majority, a fact that complicated her ability to respond forcefully to the growing Naxalite movement. The decline in Congress hegemony at the center was mirrored by its performance in the state elections of 1967. From a position of complete dominance in nearly all the state legislatures, the party won only 1,661 of a total 3,453 contested seats.36 Moreover, for the first time, non-Congress led coalition governments came to power in a number of states. These included West Bengal and Orissa, both of which would shortly be affected by the growing Naxalite movement. Notably, the United Democratic Front (UDF) government that formed in West Bengal contained a large and influential bloc of CPI-(M) legislators, a fact that proved important on a number of counts. As previously mentioned, the party’s successful embrace of electoral politics served to further radicalize the already restive militant faction within the CPI-(M). Additionally, while the moderate members of the CPI-(M) and the Naxalites did become bitter enemies, as we shall see, the legacy of their earlier cooperation and shared ideology would greatly complicate the state government’s efforts to effectively counter their activities. The structural shifts underway on India’s political scene thus served to facilitate the emergence and spread of Naxalism in a number of ways. The temporary decline of 34 Wolpert, 382-383. 35 Ibid., 385. 36 Ibid., 383. 16 legitimacy at the center created greater instability that allowed alternative ideologies to take root, while the rise to power of a number of leftist parties (including the Communists) provided breathing room for their more extreme ideological brethren. Concurrently, the new requirements of coalition building diverted politicians’ attention from the essential task of ensuring security in their constituencies.37 To these must be added one more consideration: the fractious nature of political activity undoubtedly complicated the policymaking process at a time when the country faced a range of serious economic problems. While these did not necessarily arise as a result of the political turmoil, the ability of the system to effectively address them was certainly curtailed. 2. Economic Developments In spite of a series of Soviet-inspired Five Year Plans from 1951-1966, India remained a predominantly rural, agrarian economy. Burdened by generally inefficient and backward agricultural methods, it was extremely prone to underproduction and food shortages, a situation exacerbated by the country’s rapidly expanding population. The lack of proper irrigation and over-dependence on the seasonal monsoon rains caused widespread famine in 1952-53, and severe (if localized) food shortages in Bihar and West Bengal from 1965 to 1967.38 Perennially reliant on foreign food aid, particularly from the United States, Indira’s government was forced to seek even greater assistance from America in 1966, which she received in the form of increased wheat shipments and over $400 million U.S. for the implementation of India’s fourth Five-Year Plan.39 The focus of this plan was, in the words of Mrs. Gandhi, to “lay the foundation for a breakthrough in agriculture in the countryside,” primarily through state subsidization for a host of agrarian technology reforms that came to be known as the Green Revolution. Indeed, the combination of expanded irrigation networks, increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, and the utilization of higher-yielding crop varietals that had become available in 1965 did improve the food situation; by the early 1970s, India 37 Rabindra Ray, The Naxalites and their Ideology (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1988), 115. 38 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 212; Wolpert, 362, 380. 39 Wolpert, 380-381. 17 was self-sufficient in grain production for the first time in its history.40 Like most revolutions, however, this one took time to develop and produced a large amount of economic dislocation. Nowhere was this more evident than in West Bengal. These new technologies, while partly government sponsored, still required a fairly significant initial capital outlay to procure and utilize to their fullest advantage. Moreover, they tended to be best employed on relatively large tracts of land so cultivators could reap economies of scale in the new methods of production. As Edward Duyker points out in his study of the predominantly agrarian Santal tribe in West Bengal, this had the effect of economically favoring large landholders over smaller farmers, widening what were already significant income disparities between the two.41 In a system that had its roots in the Zamindars of the British colonial era, most of these smaller farmers were in fact sharecroppers, forced to give up as much as 50% of their harvest in rent to their jotedars, or landlords. To make matters worse, if smaller farmers were to avail themselves of the new technology at all, they often had to take out loans from village moneylenders at exorbitant rates of interest, usually only worsening their economic situation.42 What these long-suffering peasants were most in need of was a comprehensive system of land reform and rural development. Given the strongly socialist leanings of both Nehru and his daughter, the failure of the government to effectively tackle these problems previously was an indication of the power of entrenched vested interests. To be sure, a number of initiatives had been implemented, notably the Community Development and Rural Extension Program under the auspices of the Ford Foundation, the Panchayati Raj program, and a series of land reform laws in the 1950s and 60s.43 Unfortunately, a combination of corruption, cronyism, and loopholes in the legislation prevented any of these measures from having much of an impact on the landless laborers, 40 Keay, 524. 41 Edward Duyker, Tribal Guerrillas: The Santals of West Bengal and the Naxalite Movement (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1987), 55-57; Sumanta Banerjee, India’s Simmering Revolution: The Naxalite Uprising (London: Zed Books Ltd., 1984), 9-12. 42 Jawaid, 40-41; Gupta, 163. 43 Wolpert, 363-364. 18 tribals, and small farmers they were designed to help.44 On the contrary, larger landowners and jotedars were often able to twist the new regulations in their favor, worsening the plight of many of the rural poor, particularly in West Bengal. Nor were economic hardships confined to the countryside. Like most of India, Calcutta had been suffering from economic stagnation for a number of years, and when the Indian government was forced to devalue the rupee in 1966, it had financial repercussions that hit the city hard. The resulting inflation spawned an industrial recession in 1966-67, causing unemployment to increase to dangerous proportions, particularly among the educated youth. While precise figures for this period are unavailable, anecdotal evidence suggests that from one third to one half of all the unemployed were aged 16-24.45 With so much economic frustration in the cities and the countryside, it is not surprising that incidents of social unrest increased as well. 3. Social Developments Given the feudal socio-economic nature of much of its history, peasant uprisings in India were not uncommon. From 1783 to 1900 alone, at the height of the British Raj, over 100 such incidents affected the region to greater or lesser degrees, many of them in the perennially restive province of Bengal.46 As the Telangana uprising in the late 1940s showed, post-independence Indian society was no less susceptible to their occurrence. In retrospect, it appears obvious that many of the factors that had precipitated these events in the past were present in the latter half of the 1960s. As the living situation deteriorated for a substantial number of India’s peasants, strikes and food riots became increasingly frequent in the later 1960s.47 By 1967, many Bengali newspapers carried accounts of impoverished rural citizens driven to suicide by their dire economic straits.48 While the 44 Banerjee, 7-9. 45 Ibid., 32. 46 Mehra, 39. 47 Wolpert, 382. 48 Banerjee, 1. 19 authenticity of all these accounts is difficult to establish, they were emblematic of the desperation and discontent of a large segment of the Indian countryside. The situation in urban society was showing signs of similar strain. Disease, overcrowding, and a lack of adequate infrastructure had long been endemic to most of India’s major cities. Now, as a result of the chronic unemployment discussed in the previous section, increasing numbers of young people were also turning to petty criminality and other anti-social behavior. Known as the “lumpen-proletariat” in Marxist circles, the activities of these idle and angry youth served to further destabilize an already fragile social situation.49 Compounding this tendency was the wave of student radicalism sweeping the world in the latter 1960s. Anti-establishment rhetoric and leftist activism were common on university campuses throughout India, but especially prevalent in Calcutta. In 1965, the Communist faction captured the leadership of the student’s union at the prestigious Presidency College and embarked on a campaign of disobedience, strikes, and protests, many of them violent.50 As clashes between police and urban youths worsened over the ensuing years, Calcutta’s student population grew more radicalized. Watching these developments from their safe houses, the leaders of the Maoist faction in the CPI-(M) grew more confident by the day. The contradictions inherent in India’s “semi-feudal and semi-colonial” society, it seemed to them, were reaching their breaking point, and the situation was ripe for the masses to rise up and finally deliver India from its centuries of capitalist domination. To ignite this potent mixture of urban and rural unrest, all that was needed was a spark. 49 Banerjee, 33. 50 Ibid., 50-52. 20 C. INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NAXALITE INSURGENCY 1. Organization and Leadership Two men in particular laid the groundwork for Naxalism’s emergence in 1967. Kanu Sanyal, a long-time CPI-(M) organizer active among the Santal tribals in Darjeeling, was among those within the party who disagreed strongly with its newly conciliatory leanings toward New Delhi and electoral politics. He discovered an ideological mentor in a passionate but lesser known party functionary, Charu Mazumdar.51 Mazumdar, born to a high caste family in Darjeeling district in 1918, had joined the Communist movement as a young man while attending university, and remained active in the CPI and CPI-(M) for most of his adult life. By the mid-1960s, he had wholeheartedly embraced Maoism as the only valid form of Communist struggle for the Indian situation. Adhering to Mao’s dictum that “political power grows from the barrel of a gun,” Mazumdar utterly rejected electoral politics and sought to apply the lessons of the Chinese revolution, as he saw them, to the struggle in his own country.52 In this, he was greatly influenced by the writings of Lin Biao, the Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and his strategic formulations for guerrilla warfare.53 Mazumdar laid out his theories in a series of essays penned between 1965 and 1967 that served as something of a manifesto for his more radical comrades, particularly in West Bengal.54 In those two years, elements of the CPI-(M) started veering on a more overtly militant course. Under the guidance of Sanyal and Mazumdar, on March 3, 1967, an uprising of poor tribals and peasants erupted in the village of Naxalbari, in the Siliguri sub-division of Darjeeling. While initially confined to the seizure of land and food-grains hoarded by the jotedars, it soon turned violent and began spreading to other villages in Siliguri. By 51 Prakash Singh, The Naxalite Movement in India (New Delhi: Rupa & Co., 2006), 268-274. 52 Jawaid, 55. 53 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 126-127. 54 Biplab Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” Social Scientist 6, no. 12 (July 1978): 8- 10. 21 July 5, the movement had grown large enough to attract the attention of its ideological progenitor, the Communist Party of China (CPC), which, in an editorial in Beijing’s People’s Daily, lauded it as “a peal of spring thunder [that] has crashed over the land of India,” and “a development of tremendous significance for the Indian people’s revolutionary struggle.”55 In reality, the rebellion was not quite that momentous at this stage, as the ease with which it was put down by the West Bengal government would attest. In late July, increased police action and a near total lack of coordination within the movement began to take their toll, and the initial uprising disintegrated by September.56 Nevertheless, the fire had been lit. Mazumdar emerged as a revolutionary leader and his ideology attracted an increasing number of adherents. Now known as Naxalites, militant groups inspired by Mazumdar’s theories began appearing throughout India. Emboldened by China’s rhetorical support, Mazumdar and these like-minded radicals officially broke from the CPI-(M). In November 1967, the All India Coordination Committee of Revolutionaries (AICCR, later renamed the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries, AICCCR) was formed in an attempt to gather the various strands of Naxalism under the banner of one revolutionary party.57 Though largely successful, the deliberations in this body revealed a number of ideological differences among the groups that would prove extremely divisive in a few years. In two cases, that of the Andhra faction of the AICCCR led by Nagi Reddy and another group known as Dakshin Desh, the differences proved insurmountable at an early stage, resulting in their exclusion from the nascent organization. Nevertheless, in April 1969, the formation of the CPI-(ML), with Mazumdar at the head, was announced in Calcutta and quickly endorsed by the CPC.58 It had an estimated 17,000 members at its founding, the majority in Andhra 55 People’s Daily, “ Spring Thunder Breaks Over India,” July 5, 1967, reprinted in Prakash Singh, 259-264. While China did offer significant rhetorical support to the Naxalite movement early on, particularly through editorials in the People’s Daily and broadcasts on the government controlled Xinhua News Agency, there is little evidence of any more concrete assistance. . 56 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 12. 57 Ibid., 31. 58 Ibid., 33. 22 Pradesh and West Bengal.59 For the next three years, the CPI-(ML) would be the dominant face of Naxalism in India. With the pronouncement that the “Chinese Chairman is our Chairman, the Chinese path is our path,” Mazumdar’s agenda for the Naxalites was codified at the First Party Congress in May 1970. It explicitly called for a Maoist inspired violent overthrow of the Indian government by establishing liberated bases in the countryside, surrounding the cities, and eventually subsuming all of India within its “people’s democratic revolution.”60 While Mazumdar’s heady optimism may be understandable in the international political context of the late 1960s, the techniques he advocated for accomplishing these objectives were questionable, to say the least. 2. Strategy and Tactics Mazumdar’s strategy was predicated on the assumption that the contradiction between feudalism and the masses of India’s rural poor had reached the breaking point.61 In his estimation, the situation was ripe for a spontaneous uprising of the beleaguered peasants that would sweep the old political order from the scene in a few short years. In a 1968 article in Liberation, the Naxalites’ primary propaganda mouthpiece, Mazumdar opined that the People’s Liberation Army would be marching through the countryside “by the beginning of 1971, if not in 1970.”62 This outlook informed his strategic formulations in a number of ways. The first was an emphasis on the rural peasants as the true base of the revolution.63 The focus of revolutionary activity was squarely on the countryside, with urban agitation initially prohibited. However, with the majority of the rural population illiterate, Mazumdar was forced to rely on educated ideologues to form the ground level leadership of his organization. To this end, he encouraged the recruitment and 59 Rabindra Ray, 108. 60 “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist),” May 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 199; Jawaid, 36. 61 Ibid.,194. 62 Charu Mazumdar, writing in Liberation, Nov 1968, as reported in Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 62. 63 “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist,” May 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 194. 23 participation of educated urban youth, but demanded they leave the cities and adopt the ways of the local villagers to better indoctrinate and lead them in their revolutionary struggle.64 While a large number of radicalized college students (especially from Calcutta) heeded this call, their insinuation into rural society was highly problematic. Most were quite incapable of adapting to village life, and their different customs engendered suspicion from the more parochial tribals and farmers.65 As a result, while peasants were often capable of being motivated for local actions, they generally failed to adopt Naxalism’s broader ideology.66 As Dipak Gupta notes, the vast majority of activist cadres were educated and from upper caste Hindu families, with poor, illiterate peasants accounting for less than 20% of the committed membership.67 One reason for this apathy among the peasants may have been the Naxalites’ renunciation of mass movements, the second pillar of Mazumdar’s strategy. In his estimation, since the country was on the verge of a spontaneous revolution, it needed no organizing force to guide it. Indeed, mass organizations could only hurt the movement, as they would give the enemy a focus for retaliation.68 While the formation of the CPI- (ML) may seem to contradict this outlook, in reality, the party functioned more symbolically than as a classical political or military organization. While Mazumdar’s ideology did reign supreme, operational control was actually quite decentralized, with village and district level organizations enjoying almost complete autonomy. This situation utterly precluded the development of any sort of broader economic or social agenda that might have been useful in attracting greater peasant support. In fact, Mazumdar believed that attention devoted to social or economic programs could only detract from the primary goal of seizing political power from the state, and actively discouraged their formulation.69 64 Ghosh, 109. 65 Gupta, 173-174; Jawaid, 95. 66 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 57-59. 67 Gupta, 171. 68 Ghosh, 101. 69 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 58-59. 24 Rather than offering hope, Mazumdar contended that the way to inspire India’s poor was to offer the opportunity for revenge. This accounted for the third pillar of his overall strategy, which he dubbed the “annihilation of class enemies.”70 As the name suggests, this entailed the deliberately brutal murder of jotedars, moneylenders, and agents of the government in an effort to spread “red terror” throughout the countryside.71 With the injunction that “he who has not dipped his hand in the blood of class enemies can hardly be called a communist,” the implementation of this campaign became the primary goal of Naxalite cadres throughout India.72 While it did succeed in driving off the landowning elite in some of the affected areas, the sadistic nature of the killings eventually alienated many more of the peasants than it inspired.73 The tactics that Mazumdar prescribed for the execution of the annihilation strategy were similarly self-defeating. Believing that an obsession with the acquisition of firearms would only distract the peasants from their spontaneous revolutionary zeal, he initially forbade their use by any but the party’s leadership, and even these he limited to purposes of self-defense. In the application of the terror campaign, the cadres were only permitted to use traditional weapons like spears, sickles, and bows and arrows. His emphasis on decentralization also stressed the primacy of village level squads, usually of no more than seven members, at the expense of larger formations of fighters.74 Though he later paid lip service to the need for organizing a ‘People’s Liberation Army’ along more conventional lines, there was never any serious attempt to form such a force.75 These tactical decisions left the Naxalites at a decided disadvantage against the comparatively well armed and organized government security forces that eventually moved in to counter them. 70 Charu Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” Liberation, February 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 290-297. 71 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 45-46. 72 Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” reprinted in Ghosh, 294. 73 Dasgupta. The Naxalite Movement, 58, 64. 74 Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” reprinted in Ghosh, 291. 75 Banerjee, 204-206. 25 For all their operational errors, however, a temporarily accommodating political climate allowed the Naxalites to embark on a series of campaigns that caused no small amount of instability in the regions they affected. From the formation of the party in 1969 until July of 1971, they were a force to be reckoned with in a number of Indian states. 3. Naxalite Activity While Naxalite activity and violence in this period were reported from as far afield as Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, the Punjab, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, the bulk remained confined to West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.76 It was in these two states that the annihilation program was most effectively implemented and where the Naxalites had their greatest political impact. Perhaps surprisingly, the first large-scale campaign after Naxalbari came not in West Bengal, but in Srikakulum district of Andhra Pradesh. Srikakulum’s history of peasant unrest predated the Naxalites, emerging as early as 1961 in the form of agitation by the native Girijan tribals against the economic oppression of the landholding class. While this was usually relatively peaceful, the example and influence of Naxalbari soon turned it violent. By late 1968, under the leadership of a number of imported Naxalite cadres, the Girijans were becoming increasingly militant. In 1969, they embarked on a classic annihilation campaign for political control, killing more than 150 people and eventually extending their writ over more than 500 square miles. While Mazumdar’s hopes were high for this “liberated area,” the movement proved more fragile than it appeared. Coordinated action by the security forces resulted in the deaths or arrests of top Naxalite leaders in the district, and Girijan support for the insurgency dissipated by mid-1970.77 In late 1969, the Naxalites launched another offensive in the Midnapur district of West Bengal. Like Srikakulum, it was a classic annihilation campaign with exclusively 76 Singh, 45-81. 77 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 46-52. 26 political aims. In Midnapur, however, the leadership that instigated the rebellion was not composed of older party cadres, but young students from Calcutta.78 Led by Ashit Chatterjee and Santosh Rana, the movement achieved some early success, accounting for the deaths of around 100 ‘class enemies’ and considerable economic disruption. Like Srikakulum, however, the uprising proved unsustainable and collapsed in the face of pressure from the security forces in early 1970.79 Birbhum in West Bengal, Muzzafarpur in Bihar, and the Palia district of Uttar Pradesh also witnessed organized Naxalite activity in 1969-1970. Like all the other rural uprisings, however, their early intensity masked fundamental weaknesses, and they died out almost as dramatically as they had flared up.80 Ironically, Naxalism’s last major campaign in this period occurred not in the countryside, but in Calcutta. Perhaps in desperation at the failures of its rural campaigns, the CPI-(ML) made an abrupt strategic reversal and launched a “cultural revolution” in West Bengal’s teeming capital in April 1970.81 While some observers have described this surprising development as a spontaneous movement by the urban Naxalite cadres, it is clear that Mazumdar himself guided the emergence of this new front at an early stage. Initially, the focus of the movement was on the destruction of symbols of bourgeoisie culture. These included cinemas, universities, and statues of iconic Indian figures like Mahatma Gandhi. Within a few months, however, the annihilation campaign appeared in Calcutta. Initially targeting police officers, its focus soon shifted to CPI-(M) politicians and activists, and even middle-class businessmen.82 The fact that Naxalite violence had now arrived in a major city occasioned great alarm throughout the country, not least in New Delhi. As the insurgency grew more violent through 1970 and early 1971, however, it became apparent that it was losing its ideological focus. In large part, this was due to a dramatic shift in the makeup of the party’s membership. While upper class university 78 Ghosh, 78-79; Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 57. 79 Singh, 63. 80 Ibid., 64-74. 81 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 68-77. 82 Ibid., 79-91. 27 students had been an important component of the early Naxalite movement, by 1970, most had either been arrested or dropped out in revulsion at the excesses of the annihilation campaign. In their place, shiftless youth, petty criminals, and other anti\u0002social elements had risen to prominence in the urban faction of the CPI-(ML). Under the guise of class struggle, extortion, theft, and personally motivated murders by party cadres grew increasingly common. Unsurprisingly, this did little to endear the Naxalites to the majority of Calcutta society. Already alienated by the statue smashing campaign and other petty vandalism, the public turned decisively against them in 1971.83 As a result of this string of failures, the ideological cracks in the leadership of the CPI-(ML) that had been evident at its founding widened into chasms. Mazumdar was increasingly the target of pointed criticism from other Naxalite leaders on a number of issues.84 Prominent among these were his adoption of the annihilation strategy as the primary form of struggle, his total neglect of the urban proletariat as a target of agitation, and the wisdom of his prohibition of all mass organization - in short, all the tenets of his grand strategy. To make matters worse, he had also lost the rhetorical support of the CPC. In late 1970, the Chinese government sent a message to Mazumdar echoing many of the same criticisms that were emanating from within his own party.85 Shortly thereafter, its radio broadcasts in support of the CPI-(ML) ceased.86 Though still claiming allegiance to Beijing, Mazumdar diverged from the CPC line in 1971 by vocally supporting the uprising in East Pakistan against Yahya Khan’s government. This proved to be the last straw for many other Naxalite leaders, who finally broke ranks with this betrayal of China’s ideological direction.87 With the leadership hopelessly divided, the rural campaign in tatters, and the lumpen-proletariat dominating the urban scene, the 83 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 94-102. 84 Sohail, 45-49. 85 Ghosh, 12-21. 86 Banerjee, 170. 87 Banerjee, 247-248; Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 192-193. 28 Naxalite movement was foundering badly. Nevertheless, it would take concerted action by the central and state governments to definitively put an end to this era of Naxalite activity. D. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 1. Center Responses Initially, the government in New Delhi paid scant attention to the outbreak of violence in Naxalbari. Viewing the situation primarily as a localized law and order problem, it did little more than express its opinion to West Bengal that the situation should be dealt with swiftly.88 To be fair, in spite of the attention it received as a result of the CPC’s endorsement, the early movement was too weak and disorganized to merit much more of a reaction. Even as Naxalism organized and spread through 1968-69, it still failed to elicit much of an official response. As mentioned previously, this was probably due to the distraction provided by the leadership battles and other political machinations that occupied the center during these years. By 1970, however, the situation was beginning to change. The emergence of Naxalite violence in Calcutta, one of India’s largest cities, was too worrisome a development to ignore. On August 11, 1970, Indira Gandhi pronounced that the government would fight the Naxalites with “all the strength at its command.”89 Securing the elections in early 1971 provided a pretext for the deployment of military and paramilitary forces to some of the worst Naxal-affected districts.90 In July 1971, the center launched Operation Steeplechase, a coordinated campaign by the Indian army, the Central Reserve Police Force, and local police across contiguous districts in West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa that were still affected by Naxalite violence. This area encompassed West Bengal’s Midnapur and Birbhum districts, and the cadres still active were largely holdovers from those earlier campaign. While Steeplechase was not a complete success, 88 Ghosh, 37. 89 Singh, 112. 90 Ghosh, xxii. 29 in that a sizeable number of activists escaped the police dragnet, it did achieve some noteworthy results: hundreds of Naxalites were arrested, large caches of weapons were seized, and most importantly, the rural population’s confidence in the strength of the government was restored.91 New Delhi also attempted to undercut the grass-roots appeal of Naxalism by championing a number of rural development and land reform schemes.92 The West Bengal Land Reform Act, passed in January 1970, was one such initiative. It imposed ceilings on the total acreage individual families were allowed to hold and reduced the maximum rent that landlords could charge their sharecroppers. As usual, the law was filled with loopholes, and the ever-present corruption and conflicts of interest severely curtailed its overall efficacy.93 Nevertheless, it did help some of the landless poor and scored political points at the expense of the Naxalites. For all the efforts of the central government, however, Naxal violence remained fundamentally a state problem. India’s Constitution devolved authority over internal security to the states, and it was their policies and initiatives that mattered most.94 Of course, if a state proved incapable of handling its own affairs, there was a constitutional answer for that, too. 2. State Responses In Andhra Pradesh, a determined state government, united under firm Congress Party rule, was able to cope with the violence in Srikakulum on its own. While allegations of police brutality and ‘encounter killings’ were common, the swift and effective application of force by the state police broke the back of the insurgency there in a matter of months.95 The situation in West Bengal was somewhat more complicated. With the CPI-(M) occupying key leadership positions in the United Democratic Front 91 Singh, 99-100. 92 Wolpert 389; Jawaid, 98-100. 93 Jawaid, 86-89. 94 Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Annual Report 2006-07, 1. 95 Ghosh, 84. 30 government, West Bengal’s response to the emergence of Naxalism was initially quite tepid. This was largely due to infighting between the members of the coalition. While other parties argued for a strong response to the initial outbreak of violence in Naxalbari, the CPI-(M) vacillated. Though it wanted to reign in its adventurist cadres in Siliguri, it was fearful of damaging its revolutionary credentials by authorizing too forceful a response. Additionally, the agitators were still members of the CPI-(M) at this stage, and the party was hopeful of bringing them back into its fold. As a result, police actions in response to the increasing violence through July 1967 were quite circumscribed.96 By the time a deteriorating situation forced the government’s hand in August and September, the movement had already attracted a sizeable following. While the insurrection in Naxalbari was effectively put down in a relatively short period of time, the damage had been done. Though the inability of the UDF to effectively govern forced its dissolution in November 1967, mid-term elections returned it to power in February 1969. With broadly the same makeup, it proved even less capable of agreement in policymaking, particularly with respect to the Naxalites. Not only did the government fail to outlaw the movement, some of its constituent parties actually sought to curry favor with the Maoists in a bid to strengthen their popularity with rural voters.97 Again, this resulted in a generally weak security response, with the police budget actually reduced just as the activity in Midnapur and Calcutta was beginning to heat up.98 With the coalition hopelessly polarized and the security situation deteriorating, New Delhi imposed President’s Rule on West Bengal in March 1970. President’s Rule, an administrative device under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, allows the center to assume executive authority in a state if the ruling government can no longer form a majority in the state legislature.99 With the governor 96 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 9. 97 Jawaid, 96-97. 98 Ibid., 73. 99 Government of India, Constitution of India, Ministry of Laws and Justice, http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/welcome.html (accessed December 11, 2007). 31 (as an agent of New Delhi) now firmly in charge, the security situation began to improve rapidly. The 1932 Bengal Suppression of Terrorist Outrage Act was quickly revived, giving the police expanded powers of detention.100 Funding for the state police forces more than doubled, and the number of officers rose dramatically.101 Augmented by personnel from the center’s Border Security Force, these additional men were posted to hotbeds of Naxalite activity, especially Siliguri, Midnapur, and Calcutta. In April, a joint operation by the Indian military and the Central Reserve Police Force, in coordination with state police, successfully put down the Midnapur uprising in a matter of weeks.102 Though it took a while longer, the expanded presence in Calcutta also proved effective. Aided by government sponsored volunteer militias, ironically drawn from the same lumpen-proletariat element the Naxalites had utilized, forceful policing resulted in the deaths or arrest of thousands of Naxalite cadres and sympathizers.103 As in Andhra Pradesh, abuses by the anti-Naxal forces were not uncommon – in one notorious instance, 300 armed members of a volunteer militia rampaged through a Naxalite stronghold in the Cossipore-Baranagore neighborhood of Calcutta, killing nearly 100 suspected Naxalites in cold blood.104 Though brutal, the tactics were effective. By the end of 1971, Mazumdar was forced to officially abandon the urban campaign in the face of mounting losses.105 The movement was by this time a spent force, and its fortunes continued to decline as top leadership was caught up in the tightening police dragnet through the first half of 1972. Finally, on July 16, 1972, Charu Mazumdar himself was arrested from a safe house in the Calcutta suburb of Entally. On July 28, he died in police custody at the age of 54. The death of Mazumdar was a fittingly symbolic denouement to the movement that had burned so brightly for over five years. With the departure of its spiritual and ideological leader, the first phase of Naxalite activity in India was over. 100 Jawaid, 83-84. 101 Ibid., 85. 102 Gupta, 171. 103 Jawaid, 84. 104 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 92. 105 Banerjee, 213. 32 E. CONCLUSION This chapter has analyzed the birth, rise, and eventual decline of the Naxalite insurgency from 1967-1972. The emergence of Naxalism in 1967 was ultimately attributable to a number of factors. Persistent poverty and growing inequality in the countryside produced a groundswell of discontentment in the poor rural population. Deeply frustrated with their government, some peasants and tribals were willing to entertain any alternative ideology that promised empowerment and greater equity; though it was certainly the most violent, Naxalism was just one of a number of socio-political movements that began to emerge at this time.106 Concurrently, political instability brought by the initial weakening of the INC’s hegemony provided room for these alternative ideologies to grow. Finally, leftist revolutionary rhetoric was ubiquitous in the late 1960s, both domestically and internationally. This provided a veneer of ideological sophistication to a movement that offered little more than violence, and allowed it to challenge the state’s legitimacy, at least for a while. However, while the Naxalite movement during this period drew much attention from the press and occasioned a great deal of worry in New Delhi and elsewhere, it seems clear in hindsight that the danger was not as great as many feared at the time. Although Naxalism touched almost every part of the country from 1967-1972, its activities were widely dispersed, and it never controlled more than 200 of India’s 56,000 rural villages at any one time.107 As militant Communism blossomed throughout much of the third world in the late 1960s, it may seem surprising that it failed to gain more traction in the Indian context, beset as it was by many of the same socio-economic problems evident in Southeast Asia or Latin America. In the final analysis, much of the responsibility for the ultimate failure of the Naxalite movement in this period must be laid at the feet of Charu Mazumdar. 106 Some others included movements based on language, caste, and even the rural-urban divide. For a discussion of these phenomena, see: Yadav and Palshikar, 92-96. 107 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 62. 33 The man regarded as ‘India’s Mao Zedong\" proved to be a much less competent leader than his Chinese namesake. Ideologically, his blind application of the Chinese revolutionary model to India overlooked fundamental differences between the two countries. India’s governmental apparatus was much more powerful than its Chinese counterpart had been in the late 1940s. The institution of parliamentary democracy had become well entrenched in India, and it would take more than temporary economic hardships to undermine its widespread support. Additionally, despite its faltering in the elections of 1967, the Congress Party proved to be enduringly popular. The INC was granted an impressive mandate in the 1971 and 1972 elections at both the state and national levels, demonstrating that it retained the support of a majority of the Indian population.108 Therefore, while Mazumdar correctly identified the rising levels of discontent in Indian society, he totally misread the resultant potential for a rapid revolution. The majority of India’s peasants were concerned with local social and economic issues, and remained unmoved by Naxalite political ideology. As it turned out, most of Mazumdar’s strategic and operational initiatives actually proved counterproductive in winning over India’s masses. His single-minded focus on the seizure of political power and utter contempt for mass organization precluded the development of any socio-economic agenda that might have been useful in garnering broad rural support. While this was supposed to be achieved through the application of the annihilation campaign, the brutality of this program actually alienated the majority of peasants. When it was extended to urban areas during the Calcutta campaign, it had the same effect on most city residents; the ill-conceived “cultural revolution” and the excesses of the lumpen-proletariat faction only exacerbated this revulsion. In the end, Mazumdar’s strategic choices effectively denied his movement any base of popular support. Nor did he better acquit himself in his tactical formulations. The curious prohibition on firearms left his cadres woefully outgunned by the military and police. Additionally, his penchant for decentralization severely restricted the Naxalites’ ability to 108 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 229-231; Wolpert, 389. 34 adapt to changing military circumstances. Even as the scale of the government’s security operations grew from 1967-1972, the Maoists continued to emphasize small, village-level units at the expense of a more sizeable and coherent military organization. Time and again, these proved incapable of mounting an effective resistance to the larger, better equipped, and more highly organized forces arrayed against them. While Mazumdar’s inept leadership set the stage for the movement’s demise, the overall effectiveness of the government’s response must also be acknowledged. With the exception of the UDF initiatives in West Bengal, robust and forceful responses by state and central security forces were eventually successful in putting down all the uprisings. While these did involve a number of human rights abuses, the growing public disgust with Naxalite violence meant that most Indians seemed to accept these aggressive policing methods.109 Simultaneously, all levels of government increased funding for land reforms and rural development programs in an effort to address the socio-economic inequities that had helped spark the outbreak of violence. While these did not always work as they were intended, they did succeed in winning back the support of the rural poor. The final contributor to the failure of the Naxalite movement in this period was its overall organizational weakness. Mazumdar’s charismatic personality had papered over the movement’s fissiparous tendencies in 1967, but these forces could not be contained for long. Ideological differences and powerful egos erupted again in late 1970, and the leadership had irrevocably fractured by 1972. The CPI-(ML) splintered into a number of different factions, including the Maoist Communist Centre, the Proletarian Party, and a grouping of the CPI-(ML)’s Regional Committees of West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.110 Along with Dakshin Desh and the Nagi Reddy Group, these localized, weakened, and divided organizations would be the diminished face of Naxalism through its next period of activity, 1972-1991. 109 Gupta, 173 110 Jawaid, 94. 35 III. THE FRAGMENTARY PERIOD (1972-1991) A. INTRODUCTION In 1972, the Naxalites emerged from the failures and setbacks at the end of the Organizational Period in a critically weakened state: their founder and most influential leader, Charu Mazumdar, was dead; their surviving leadership was rotting in jail after a brutally effective government crackdown; their activists were disillusioned and demoralized after a succession of defeats; and the excesses of revolutionary zeal had alienated them from the vast majority of the Indian public. Given this litany of woes, most observers could be forgiven for assuming that the movement was as good as dead. As it turned out, the flame ignited at Naxalbari had not extinguished – it was, however, reduced to a smoldering ember that was very nearly snuffed out over the course of the next two decades.111 The years from 1972-1991 unquestionably marked the nadir of the Naxalite movement in India. Battered by the government’s security forces in the previous period, it desperately needed to reunify and consolidate its position. Instead, it was repeatedly fragmented by disagreements over ideological abstractions, strategic formulations, and even personal egos. The result was a proliferation of small, localized groups that proved utterly incapable of mounting any effective challenge to the Indian government. In short, the story of the Naxalites in this period is a rather boring one compared to the events of 1965-1972. It is, nonetheless, one worth examining. For the purposes of analyzing Naxalism’s resurgence after 1991, this period is important on three counts. First, it acted as a bridge between the two periods of relatively high Naxalite activity. Secondly, it gave rise to the factions that turned into the dominant Naxalite groups of the current era; clearly, any study of these organizations must take into account the circumstances of their birth. Lastly, determining the reasons for the movement’s inability to gain traction in the past should help in prescribing effective ways to counter its spread in future. 111 This analogy is borrowed, with appreciation, from Prakash Singh’s The Naxalite Movement in India. 36 B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments The 1970s and 80s were a transitional period in Indian politics. The instability of 1965-1971, discussed in the preceding chapter, was the first indication that the institution of one-party hegemony known as the ‘Congress System’ was not as unshakeable as it had previously appeared.112 Though Indira’s party enjoyed landslide victories at the state and national levels in 1971 and 1972, successfully consolidating the INC and the country under the banner of her leadership, this apparent return to the stability of the old ‘Congress system’ belied a number of emerging structural changes in the Indian polity. Chief among these were the increasing politicization of lower and middle classes and castes, the rising importance of local-level issues, and the resultant emergence of regional and state level parties. While these processes evolved gradually, they set the stage for the tremendous changes that would occur on the Indian political scene in the 1990s, and helped make politics in these two decades more complex than it had been in the past. Though a thorough examination of these phenomena is outside the scope of this thesis, they indirectly impacted the course of Naxalism in a number of ways.113 One was through political developments in New Delhi. As previously alluded, Congress (I) emerged in 1972 with firm control of the national government. In light of the changing political scene, the party was remarkably effective in maintaining its grip on power for the remainder of this period, only relinquishing it during two brief interludes of Janata Party-led coalition government, in 1977-1980 and 1989-1991. In retrospect, this success was largely due to Indira’s political guile and capacity for heavy-handed authoritarianism. Recognizing that anti-colonial nationalism was no longer an effective rallying cry for the masses, she sought to mobilize support by turning to a more populist 112 Rajni Kothari, “The Congress ‘System’ in India,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 58-70. 113 For an excellent examination of structural changes in Indian politics during this period, see: Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952- 2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 73-113. 37 message.114 Though Congress remained the party of India’s industrial classes, it also began to reemphasize its socialist roots. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, agricultural development, poverty reduction, and economic self-sufficiency featured prominently in Congress’ platform, successfully attracting significant portions of the lower classes and castes.115 This shift in message did more than win elections – it also boosted the government’s legitimacy with India’s poor, thereby undercutting the appeal of alternative ideologies like Naxalism. When rhetoric proved insufficient in maintaining Congress hegemony, however, the party was not averse to taking more extreme measures. The imposition of the ‘Emergency’ from June 1975 to March 1977 demonstrated this most strikingly. Faced with declining popularity and a series of legal challenges to her rule, Mrs. Gandhi temporarily abrogated the constitution, suspended all civil rights, jailed opposition political figures, and instituted martial law throughout the country.116 Though democracy and the rule of law were reinstated with the national elections in 1977, Indira, and the Congress Party more generally, showed themselves more than willing to deal harshly with political opposition. As we will see, this resulted in a usually muscular response to separatist movements and other insurrections, including those of the Naxalite groups. Developments at the state level were also important. Throughout the early 1970s and the period of the Emergency, Congress governments retained power in the vast majority of the Indian states. However, after the INC’s temporary defeat at the center in 1977, the number and influence of state-level parties accelerated dramatically. Significantly, this phenomenon began in those areas most affected by Naxalism during the previous period, with the emergence of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh and the resurgence of the CPI-(M) in West Bengal.117 The growth of these parties, many of which depended on tenant farmers and landless laborers for their 114 Yadav and Palshikar, 96. 115 Wolpert, 389-410. 116 Ibid., 398-399. 117 Yadav and Palshikar, 106-112. 38 primary constituencies, gave a new political voice to groups that had been effectively disenfranchised in the past. Their inclusion in the political process helped keep rural unrest in check and brought an added impetus for meaningful action on economic issues that were dear to this large demographic. 2. Economic Developments India’s economy during this period was something of a mixed bag. At the macro level, Congress’ socialist policies, the persistence of an overbearing public sector epitomized by the ‘License Raj’ and a strategy of import-substitution industrialization introduced significant distortions in the economy that stifled growth the country so desperately needed. While overall GDP increased at an average of 3.5 percent throughout the 1970s, an exploding population meant the corresponding rate per capita was only 1.3 percent, far below that of the rest of the developing world. Though tepid attempts at liberalization resulted in slightly higher growth rates in the 1980s, their incomplete nature resulted in a balance of payments crisis that ultimately proved unsustainable and precipitated the economic reforms of the 1990s.118 On the other hand, the benefits of the Green Revolution were finally becoming more evenly distributed, and Congress’ newfound political populism translated into a slew of rural and agricultural development initiatives and aid programs.119 For the country’s poor farmers at least, the picture was finally becoming a bit brighter. Indira’s initial reforms after the 1971 elections were ambitious in scope and included land-reform legislation, rural employment programs, nationalization of food markets, and investment in transportation infrastructure designed to help farmers get their product to market. These were consolidated in the country’s Fifth Five Year Plan, launched in 1974, the explicit aims of which were the “removal of poverty” and the “attainment of economic self-reliance.” For all its optimism, the plan’s designs were complicated by the same corruption and conflicts of interest that had plagued reform efforts in previous eras. Additionally, the worldwide oil shocks of the early 1970s 118 Gurcharan Das, “The India Model,” Foreign Affairs 85, no. 4 (July/August 2006): 4-5. 119 Wolpert, 387-388; Jawaid, 100-102. 39 brought massive inflation that substantially diminished economic growth in real terms. Bihar and Gujarat erupted in riots and protests at the diminishing economic situation, and a national railroad strike threatened to bring the country to a standstill and compound its economic problems.120 Though political factors contributed more directly to the imposition of the Emergency in 1975, Indira used her newfound power to tackle the economic challenges facing the country. Her ‘Twenty-Point Program’ of economic development was very similar to the country’s Fifth Five Year Plan, but with political opposition sidelined, Mrs. Gandhi was able to force its implementation more effectively.121 For all its authoritarianism, the Program was remarkably successful in getting the economic situation under control and finally bringing some relief to farmers and the rural poor. Inflation was successfully tamed, food prices retreated to their 1971 levels, and agricultural investment and subsidies began reaching the people that truly needed them.122 When the Emergency was repealed and the Janata government came to power in 1977, the coalition proved so weak and the government so ineffectual that economic problems returned almost immediately. Inflation and unemployment skyrocketed, and Congress returned to power in 1980 with the slogan “Elect a Government that Works!”123 Though she initially tried to cut agricultural subsidies, the political backlash convinced Indira and her party that the rural interests would still have to be placated. The Sixth Five Year Plan brought numerous anti-poverty initiatives like the Integrated Rural Development Program and the National Rural Employment Program, and inaugurated huge agricultural subsidies that continued throughout the 1980s.124 In sum, while overall economic performance throughout this period was relatively mediocre, the numerous development initiatives meant the plight of the rural poor ceased to deteriorate as it had 120 Wolpert, 396-397. 121 Ibid., 400. 122 Ibid., 403. 123 Ibid., 407-410. 124 Banerjee, 293. 40 from 1965-1972. In fact, the rural poverty rate declined relatively dramatically over this period, from 56% in 1973 to only 39% by 1988.125 This is not to imply that these programs were unqualified successes; corruption and conflicts of interest continued to hamper their implementation, and their benefits were far from uniformly distributed. Nevertheless, they were successful enough to alleviate some of the income disparities that had stoked the fires of Naxalism in the previous period, and diminished economic and class issues as a source of social unrest.126 3. Social Developments Despite the attenuation of economic inequity as a source of social strife, the 1970s and ‘80s witnessed the birth of new ethnic and religious cleavages in India’s heterogeneous society, precipitating the rise of a number of new communal and secessionist movements. Though none of these were directly connected to the phenomenon of Naxalism, their emergence and the government’s response did have implications for the Maoists’ fortunes. Two of the most prominent of these movements occurred in the Punjab and India’s wild Northeast. In the late 1970s, a wave of unrest swept India’s ‘Seven Sisters,’ the small and predominantly tribal states east of the Siliguri corridor. While the trouble started in response to an influx of Bengali refugees in the wake of the 1971 Indo-Pak War, it soon took on a distinctly separatist character.127 Historically, the region had only the loosest association with the rest of the subcontinent and was much more culturally bound to neighboring areas of Burma than to the rest of India. By the early 1980s, the Assamese, Bodo, Naga, and Mizo peoples had launched a series of violent secessionist movements, many of which continue to the present day. In response, New Delhi imposed martial law and dispatched the military and central police forces to put down the rebellions.

The Sikh community had agitated for a separate Sikh nation, notionally known as Khalistan, since around the time of Partition and Independence in 1947. The movement had been largely peaceful in the intervening decades, but by the late 1970s, it was becoming more belligerent. Under the leadership of J. S. Bhindranwale, a Sikh religious guru, armed members of the separatist Akali Dal Party stormed the Golden Temple at Amritsar in a direct challenge to New Delhi’s authority. In response to the rising violence and lawlessness throughout the Punjab, Indira’s actions were swift and uncompromising. In June of 1984, the Indian Army launched ‘Operation Bluestar,’ retaking the Golden Temple by force and inflicting massive casualties on its Sikh defenders.129 The operation cost Mrs. Gandhi her life (she was shortly thereafter assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards) and did not end the Khalistan movement immediately. It did, however, set the tone for the center’s response through the remainder of the decade.130 Extremely aggressive security actions continued, and ultimately proved successful in putting down the insurrection by the early 1990s. For the Naxalites, the impact of unrest in the Punjab and the Northeast was twofold. First, it seems likely that the threats to the integrity of the nation served to rally significant portions of the electorate to the government, giving New Delhi an added source of legitimacy. Much as the government enjoyed a boost of popularity in 1971-72 during the Indo-Pak war, the actions against the animist tribals and (especially) the Sikhs played well with India’s majority Hindu polity.131 This doubtlessly helped curtail the popularity of an anti-government ideology like Naxalism. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the aggressive response to each of these movements presented a daunting 128 Wolpert, 425-426. 129 Ibid., 416-418. 130 Ibid., 423-425. 131 Ibid., 418. 42 challenge to any other would-be troublemakers. As historian Stanley Wolpert notes, “The stunning, shocking violence of Operation Bluestar served to put every minority in India on immediate notice of just how dangerous continued opposition to Delhi could be.”132 The Naxalites could certainly be included as one of these minority groups. As we shall see, however, the most potent enemy of Naxalism in this period was the internal disarray of the movement itself. C. INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NAXALITE INSURGENCY 1. Organization and Leadership Following the death of Charu Mazumdar in 1972, the Naxalites underwent a process of fragmentation that severely crippled the movement over the ensuing decades. Though their total numbers stayed relatively steady, with most estimates in the neighborhood of 15,000 activists nationwide, the leadership was increasingly driven by ideological and operational differences of opinion.133 While the failures of the previous period were the immediate catalyst for this phenomenon, the movement had displayed factionalist tendencies almost from its inception. At the organizational meetings of the AICCCR in 1969, two groups parted ways with the nascent CPI-(ML) from the outset. The first of these was the Andhra faction of Naxalites under the leadership of Nagi Reddy. Reddy differed with Mazumdar’s formulations on a number of points, most crucially the blanket ban on elections and the single-minded emphasis on the annihilation strategy at the expense of economic struggles and mass organization.134 After being disaffiliated from the AICCCR, Reddy formed his own organization in 1969, the Andhra Pradesh Revolutionary Communist Committee (APRCC). While the APRCC was initially larger than the CPI-(ML), Reddy’s arrest in late 1969 severely curtailed its activities.135 In the 1970s, the APRCC broke up into a 132 Wolpert, 418. 133 New York Times, “Maoist Extremists Reappear in India,” October 12, 1980. 134 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 154-156. 135 Ibid., 34. 43 number of smaller organizations, the two most significant of which were the Unity Center of Communist Revolutionaries of India (UCCRI) led by Nagi Reddy himself and Chandra Pulla Reddy’s Revolutionary Communist Center (RCC).136 While both groups were marginally active in Andhra Pradesh through the 1970s, they underwent numerous splits themselves in the latter half of the decade. By 1990, these smaller groups had either withered to inconsequence or been absorbed by other Naxalite outfits. The other faction that split from the AICCCR in 1969 was known as Dakshin Desh. Its leaders, Amulya Sen and Kanai Chatterjee, also disagreed with Mazumdar over the necessity of mass organization and established their own group, initially based in West Bengal. With the government crackdowns of 1970-71, Dakshin Desh moved its operations to Bihar, changing its name to the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) in 1975.137 Though relatively small, the MCC remained a more or less coherent organization over the course of these two decades. The same could certainly not be said for Charu Mazumdar’s CPI-(ML). The party had always been a relatively fragile construct of disparate personalities and ideologies, but after the setbacks of 1971-1972, it underwent a dizzying process of fractionalization that resulted in the emergence of literally dozens of competing groups. As the smaller organizations were often short-lived and of little real significance in the future development of the movement, only the most important will be enumerated here. Following Mazumdar’s death in 1972, the CPI-(ML) split into two broad camps: those who supported his ideology, strategy, and tactics, and those who opposed them. The pro-Mazumdar camp was further divided in 1973, with Lin Biao’s fall from grace in the Chinese Communist Party. A source of great inspiration for Mazumdar’s ideology, his disavowal by the Chinese generated contentious ideological debate within this branch of Naxalism.138 The pro-Mazumdar/pro-Lin Biao faction, a distinct minority, regrouped in West Bengal under the leadership of Mahadev Mukherjee.139 The pro-Mazumdar/anti- 136 Banerjee, 166, 298. 137 Prakash Singh, 115-116. 138 Banerjee, 246. 139 Ghosh, 175-177. 44 Lin Biao faction emerged in Bihar as CPI-(ML) Liberation, and in Andhra Pradesh as the Central Organizing Committee CPI-(ML), or COC-(ML).140 The COC-(ML) would itself split in 1977, with one faction, led by Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, reestablishing itself in 1980 as CPI-(ML) People’s War Group, or PWG, in Andhra Pradesh.141 Among the anti-Mazumdar camp, the shakeout in this period was somewhat less confusing. The largest group emerged under the leadership of Satyanarayan Singh, the erstwhile Secretary of the CPI-(ML)’s Bihar State Committee. Singh had fallen out with Mazumdar in late 1971 over the latter’s authoritarian tendencies and seemingly suicidal tactical injunctions. In November of that year, Singh and a number of similarly disenchanted leaders formed a parallel leadership and actually expelled Mazumdar from his own party.142 Though most of the Naxalite rank-and-file did not initially accept this, Singh attracted a sizeable following after Mazumdar’s passing. His organization, known as CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh, was the largest and most influential of the post-Mazumdar Naxalite groups in the 1970s.143 The only other sizeable anti-Mazumdar group to emerge was Bihar’s CPI-(ML) Unity Committee, led by Khokan Mazumdar (no relation to Charu). In 1982, this group merged with the Bihar faction of the COC-(ML) to form the CPI-(ML) Party Unity, with Naveen Prasad as its new leader.144 While the proliferation of groups in this period might give an impression of vitality, the splintering of the movement was actually indicative of a great deal of uncertainty and acrimony in the ranks. While all still agreed on the need for a Maoist\u0002inspired political revolution in the country, Mazumdar’s death and the fallout from the failures of the 1965-1972 period had left the Naxalites confused and quarrelsome, on issues both practical and ideological. Cries of ‘revisionism’ by one group were answered with counteraccusations of ‘left-adventurism’ from another. The resultant infighting left 140 Prakash Singh, 156; Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 22. 141 Prakash Singh, 130. 142 Ghosh, 139-144, 151. 143 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 10. 144 Prakash Singh, 159-160. 45 the cadres demoralized and the leadership even more hopelessly divided.145 Perhaps no issue generated more contention than the most appropriate strategy to pursue in the post\u0002Mazumdar era. 2. Strategy and Tactics Following the security crackdowns in 1971-72, most of the Naxalite groups initially continued to advocate a violent strategy. With the memories of government repression fresh in their minds, this was not altogether surprising – most of their leaders continued to languish in prison, often under harsh conditions. Dakshin Desh and the pro\u0002Lin Biao faction in West Bengal were particularly vociferous in their agitation for a continuation of the annihilation policy. The other groups placed more rhetorical emphasis on building up mass organizations, but they too were initially unwilling to forswear armed struggle against the hated oppressors.146 However, with the end of the Emergency and the rise of the first Janata government, a more moderate position began to emerge within a key segment of the Naxalite movement. The CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh was the first major organization to change tack. Negotiating with Janata politicians from his jail cell after the 1977 elections, Singh’s aversion to electoral politics and compromise with the state softened. In a surprise move, he released a press statement in April 1977 expressing his “critical support” for the new Janata government and vowing that his group would participate in the assembly elections of June of that year.147 The formerly staunch advocate of the annihilation strategy went so far as to announce, “We wish to state categorically here that violence is not our ideology. Our ideology is Marxism-Leninism.”148 Though he justified this ideological reversal on the grounds that it would secure the release of political prisoners and enable the Maoists to present their platform to more of the population than ever before, his move 145 Jawaid, 94-95. 146 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 11. 147 Ibid., 14. 148 Prakash Singh, 121-122. 46 was viewed as treason by the rest of the movement.149 However, when the Janata government delivered on its promises of clemency and one of Singh’s candidates was actually elected in West Bengal (Santosh Rana, formerly the leader of the Midnapur uprising), his approach was vindicated in the eyes of many Naxalites. Even such old\u0002school stalwarts as Kanu Sanyal and Ashim Chatterjee eventually gave Singh’s strategy their grudging endorsement.150 Throughout the rest of the 1970s and 80s, CPI-(ML) Liberation and various lesser organizations followed the CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh’s lead and slowly moderated their stance. To be sure, it took time for the incidences of violence to diminish, and many of these groups stressed that they still retained the option of armed revolution.151 Nevertheless, they increasingly normalized their activities, allying themselves with leftist political parties and contesting elections at the state level through front organizations in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal.152 For other groups, however, rapprochement with any government forces, whatever their political stripes, remained anathema. The MCC, COC-(ML), and CPI-(ML) Unity Committee acknowledged the need for a greater emphasis on mass organization, but only in support of armed agrarian revolution.153 The latter two organizations splintered in the late 1970s, but their descendants carried on their two-pronged strategy of mass mobilization and violent opposition in the subsequent decade. Both the PWG and Party Unity continued the killing of jotedars and other class enemies, but not as single-mindedly as the CPI-(ML) had in the past. They also established aboveground organizations to agitate for land reform and minimum wages, and began setting up parallel administrations to dispense justice and other government functions that were lacking in the remote areas where they operated.154 Interestingly, the PWG was also able to attract some support by waging a 149 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 14-15. 150 Prakash Singh, 123. 151 Ibid., 158. 152 Tilak, 19-20; Prakash Singh, 123. 153 Prakash Singh, 123. 154 Ibid., 133-134. 47 campaign against social vice in the villages, which included crusades against drunkenness, gambling, and prostitution.155 Despite their avowed commitment to a similarly multi-pronged approach, the MCC was generally less successful in these secondary endeavors. During the 1980s, the group was best known for the gruesome nature of its continuing annihilations, still directed primarily at upper caste landlords.156 At the tactical level, those groups espousing violence began implementing more realistic methods in their continued pursuit of armed revolution. Discarding the Charuist aversion to modern weaponry, most actively encouraged the capture of guns from jotedars and police.157 While this slowly improved the Naxalites’ firepower, their operations remained dominated by small squad-level actions, and were generally unsophisticated in terms of their planning and execution. In the late 1980s, the PWG did receive some training from LTTE rebels in more advanced tactics, including the use of explosives. This enabled them to successfully carry out a land-mine attack against police forces in 1989, providing a deadly portent of things to come.158 For the most part, however, major improvements in the Maoists’ operational capabilities would not come until well into the next decade. 3. Naxalite Activity As fundamental as it was, the split between those groups that followed the Singh line of political normalization and those that continued with the strategy of violence was just one of a host of divisions that spread like a cancer through the movement. Even groups on the same side of the strategic divide remained pitted against one another over issues of personality or ideology, and fratricide was not uncommon.159 In this contentious environment, there was little hope of consolidation or cooperation. Split as 155 Prakash Singh, 137-138. 156 Ibid., 151-153. 157 Ibid., 136 , 151. 158 Ibid., 140-141. 159 Ibid., 155. 48 they were into numerous smaller groupings, the Naxalites’ activity in this period was generally circumscribed and remained restricted to a few small geographic areas. Throughout the early and mid-1970s, a combination of effective security efforts and the imprisonment of most of the leadership put a stop to almost all violent Naxalite activity. Indeed, brief periods of unrest were recorded in only two places: northern West Bengal and Bhojpur district in Bihar. The agitation in West Bengal erupted in 1973, led by the pro-Mazumdar/pro-Lin Biao faction of Mahadev Mukherjee. For about a year, actions against police forces resulted in several dozen deaths and the seizure of a similar number of firearms, but the uprising fizzled with Mukherjee’s arrest towards the end of 1974.160 The activity in Bhojpur was slightly longer lived, lasting from 1972-1977, and was led by CPI-(ML) Liberation. Still committed to violent revolution at this stage, the group carried out a number of annihilations against class enemies with the support of local tribes. Still, the uprising was a small-scale affair, accounting for only around ninety deaths over the entire five-year period, with its longevity due more to the state government’s anemic response than the actual strength of the insurgency. Like its counterpart in West Bengal, it was put down relatively easily with the introduction of more aggressive security measures, this time from the center.161 The late 1970s witnessed the dramatic announcements of Satyanarayan Singh and the political normalization of a number of Naxalite groups. Though gradual, this proved to be an enduring phenomenon, and the CPI-(ML) S.N.Singh and its followers largely retreated from violent activities. Though still active politically, their strategic course change effectively removed them from the Naxalite fold by the early 1980s, at least for the purposes of this thesis. As for the more recalcitrant Maoists, two dozen smaller groups remained minimally active in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and a number of southern states.162 Between them all, however, they accounted for only a handful of incidents and even fewer deaths. Throughout the 1980s, the only groups of 160 Ghosh, 175-177. 161 Prakash Singh, 117-119. 162 Ibid., 124. 49 any real significance were the PWG in Andhra Pradesh, and what the Indian security official Prakash Singh dubbed the ‘New Left’ in Bihar.163 Formed in April 1980 by Kandapalli Seetharamaiah, the PWG quickly became the most powerful Naxalite organization in the country. Though this latter fact was admittedly not much of a boast during this period, they were a disruptive influence in their primary area of operations, the perennially restive and underdeveloped Telangana region.164 While the group did engage in rudimentary social projects and set up a number of peasant organizations to help mobilize the masses in pursuit of economic goals, Seetharamaiah was also a firm believer in Mazumdar’s annihilation strategy. As Table 1 shows, the group grew increasingly violent under his leadership, with attacks on jotedars, police, and police informants.165 Though still relatively contained by the end of the 1980s, the PWG was already demonstrating the bloody ruthlessness that would distinguish it in later decades. The ‘New Left’ in Bihar emerged at roughly the same time as the PWG. Comprised of the MCC, Party Unity, and CPI-(ML) Liberation, the title may give a misleading impression of cooperation amongst the groups. In reality, they fought each other nearly as often as they engaged ‘class enemies,’ often in petty squabbles over turf or ideological nuances. 163 Prakash Singh, 124. 164 Ibid., 129-141. 165 Ibid., 140 YEAR INCIDENTS KILLED 1981 53 10 1982 98 18 1983 172 17 1984 306 30 1985 308 30 1986 161 25 1987 252 63 1988 453 59 1989 456 84 1990 735 94 Table 1. Naxalite Violence in Andhra Pradesh 50 Nevertheless, they too managed to make an impact at the state level. Like Telangana, Bihar remained beyond the reach of many of the government’s reform initiatives, and pockets of rural unrest continued to provide havens for Naxalite cadres.166 Though Liberation was the largest of the three groups, its gradual embrace of electoral politics over the course of the decade made it the least violently active. It maintained an armed wing into the 1990s, but its aboveground political organization, the Indian People’s Front, increasingly supplanted the influence of its more belligerent cadres.167 The faction favoring normalization gained dominance in 1992, and Liberation thereafter functioned primarily as an aboveground outfit, focused almost exclusively on peaceful mass organization.168 In a telling signal of the extent of their moderation, its leaders even called for rapprochement with the formerly despised CPI and CPI-(M), in an effort to build a more coordinated leftist political front.169 By contrast, the MCC and Party Unity remained exclusively committed to armed revolution. Mass organization was desirable, but in the context of a burgeoning caste conflict in the state during this period, often difficult to mobilize along exclusively class lines. Instead, the annihilation strategy was pursued with a decidedly grisly purpose, particularly by the MCC. In most cases, upper caste jotedars and their families were the primary targets but, with the conflation of caste and class conflicts in the state, the sadistic nature of the killings failed to generate the same backlash that had occurred previously. As a result, both the MCC and Party Unity were able to carve out small areas of influence in Bihar over the latter half of the 1980s.170 As in Andhra Pradesh, however, this level of activity remained a far cry from that of 1967-1972. 166 Prakash Singh, 148-160. 167 Tilak, 19. 168 Prakash Singh, 158. 169 Tilak, 20. 170 Prakash Singh, 148-156, 159-160. 51 D. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 1. Center Responses From the halls of power in New Delhi, Naxalism appeared to be a spent force after 1972. With the center caught up in the drama of systemic political change and the growth of ethnic secessionist movements over these two decades, relatively scant attention was paid to the fractured and localized Maoist movement in the country. Nevertheless, as alluded in Section 3.2, developments at the national level did have an impact on the Naxalites. With the INC’s turn to a more populist platform, new rural development and land reform initiatives effectively undercut the movement’s base of support. With rural inequality receding rather than growing, the more militant cadres had a much harder time finding sympathetic base areas from which to operate. Even for those sections of the movement that drifted in a more moderate direction, the government’s schemes were successful in stealing their rhetorical thunder and foiling most attempts at mass organization; Naxalite candidates did not generally have much success at the polls, Santosh Rana’s success notwithstanding.171 While these developments posed indirect problems for the Naxalites, a much more immediate challenge emerged with the imposition of the Emergency in 1975. Though not primarily directed at the Naxalites, the resultant political and security crackdowns hit the movement hard. Like most other opposition groups, all Naxalite organizations were banned and scores of leaders and party activists rearrested under the newly instituted Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA).172 Among them were some of the Maoists’ most effective organizers, including Kanu Sanyal, Ashim Chatterjee, and Satyanarayan Singh. Moreover, the security forces were given wide latitude in dealing with whatever opposition escaped the prison cell. Frequently, this entailed direct action like that of ‘Operation Thunder,’ which crushed the long-simmering 171 Prakash Singh, 211-212. 172 Banerjee, 297. 52 unrest in Bhojpur with combined operations by the military and Central Reserve Police forces in 1977.173 Already in tatters after Mazumdar’s death, the Naxalite movement was nearly destroyed by the center’s expanded powers during the Emergency.174 Ironically, it was also New Delhi that granted it a new lease on life. The Janata government’s promises to undo the excesses of the Emergency resulted in the release of hundreds of Naxalite prisoners all across the country in 1977 and 1978, the legalization of most of their organizations, and the easing of pressure by government security forces.175 While this ultimately had the effect of moderating several factions and co\u0002opting them into the political process, it also freed the more hard-core cadres to resume their subversive activities. Though the INC returned to power in New Delhi in 1980, it did not resume its previous activities against the Naxalites. In part, this was due to the still extremely weak state of the movement. More importantly, however, the government already had its hands full with the growing unrest in Punjab and the Northeast. Nevertheless, the center’s security initiatives with respect to these other regions reverberated among the Naxalites. The extremely aggressive response to these insurgencies likely helped convince the more moderate Maoists that the path of armed rebellion was untenable and provided some deterrent effect even to their more violent-minded brethren. Whatever the case, Naxalite violence remained at a sufficiently low ebb through the 1980s to permit the central government to largely dismiss it as a local law and order problem. The same could not necessarily be said for those states that were more directly affected. 2. State Responses As the birthplace of Naxalism, West Bengal had the longest history in dealing with the insurgency. While effective policing put down the 1973-74 uprising of Mahadev Mukherjee’s faction, rural unrest continued to simmer under a series of Congress administrations. When a Left Front coalition government returned to power in 1977, 173 Prakash Singh, 119. 174 Mehra, 51-52. 175 Prakash Singh, 122; Tilak, 12. 53 however, the situation changed dramatically. Led by the CPI-(M), the new administration proved much more competent and enduring than its predecessors. Under its direction, West Bengal instituted a series of land redistribution and rural development initiatives that proved remarkably successful. One of these was ‘Operation Barga,’ which established strict ceilings on total landholdings by individuals and granted inheritable ownership rights to tenant farmers and sharecroppers.176 Unencumbered by the political compromises, conflicts of interest, and enforcement issues that so often plagued center\u0002led efforts, these state-level reforms removed the Maoists’ raison d’etre in a few short years. By the early 1980s, Naxalism had ceased to be a force of any consequence in the state.177 Though not as successful as West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh was able to mount an intermittently effective counter to its Naxalite problem. The TDP, which came to power in 1983, initially pursued a policy of appeasement with the PWG in an effort to lure them to peace talks. When it became clear that the group had no intention of negotiating in good faith (and had, in fact, used the opportunity to consolidate and strengthen their positions), the state’s Chief Minister, N.T. Rama Rao, adopted a hard line against the Naxalites.178 Rao authorized aggressive policing measures against PWG cadres and oversaw the formation of the Greyhounds, the state’s elite anti-Naxal police unit, in the late 1980s.179 Though he supported aggressive security measures, Rao did not neglect the rural development initiatives that had proved so successful in West Bengal. Land reform and rural employment initiatives were implemented with moderate success, but a lack of government infrastructure in remoter parts of the state made their implementation there difficult.180 In 1989, the INC returned to power in state elections, but initially made the same early mistakes as the TDP. The new Chief Minister, Chenna Reddy, tried to 176 Prakash Singh, 179. 177 Mehra, 56; Prakash Singh, 236. 178 Prakash Singh, 139. 179 Andhra Pradesh State Police, “Units: Greyhounds,” http://www.apstatepolice.org/AboutUs/units/units_greyhounds.htm (accessed February 4, 2008). 180 K.C. Suri, “Telugu Desam Party,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 294-295. 54 appease the PWG in a vain attempt to lure them into the mainstream, releasing several hundred Naxalite prisoners rounded up under the previous administration.181 When this approach failed again, Reddy reverted to Rao’s combination of tough policing and socio\u0002economic development. Despite these ups and downs, the state was relatively successful in confining the PWG to the Telangana region and a few neighboring districts throughout the 1980s. By contrast, the containment of the MCC and Party Unity in Bihar had little to do with the state government. The Janata Party captured control of the state briefly, from 1977 to 1980, but the remainder of this period was dominated by INC administrations. In reality, however, it scarcely mattered who controlled the government. Corruption, cronyism, and maladministration took root in Bihar in the 1970s and continued to flourish through the 1980s.182 Unable to mount effective security or development initiatives of any kind, the government essentially left the rural parts of the state to their own devices, providing space for the embers of Naxalism to smolder. While the growth of caste conflict in the state, as well as internecine fighting between the MCC and PU, were enough to keep the Naxalites more or less in check during these decades, the state’s appallingly poor governance would become an issue in the future resurgence of Naxalism. E. CONCLUSION The Fragmentary Period was a prolonged low point in the history of Naxalism in India. After its brief but significant surge from 1967 to 1972, the movement underwent a period of stagnation and decay that lasted nearly two decades and effectively removed it from the public consciousness. Though not as captivating a story as the vitality of the previous period, the impotence of the movement and its singular inability to gain traction during these years are still worthy of examination. 181 Sanjoy Hazarika, “Indian Rebel Group is Linked to Train Attack,” New York Times, October 21, 1990. 182 Prakash Singh, 148-150. 55 The most obvious reason for the failure of Naxalism in this period was its own organizational weakness. Fractured into dozens of smaller, competing factions, it was too dispersed and fragmented to mount any kind of meaningful challenge to the forces of the Indian state. In large part, this was a failure of leadership. Consumed by their personal egos, strategic and tactical differences, and ideological arguments incomprehensible to any but the most dogmatic Marxists, the heads of the various Naxalite organizations were utterly incapable of resolving their disputes and coordinating the activities of their disparate groups. As a consequence, a large portion of the movement effectively abandoned the revolutionary line, and those that remained were confined to a few small pockets of activity in the hinterlands. With the structure of the movement in such a state, its success would have been unlikely in even a permissive security environment. As it turned out, the security environment was decidedly unfavorable. The imposition of the Emergency in the 1970s granted the state a great deal of leeway in dealing with opposition movements, and it used them to devastating affect against the already fragmented Naxalites. Indeed, the movement was very nearly destroyed by policing actions like Operation Thunder and the imprisonment of hundreds, if not thousands of its activists. The situation in the 1980s was hardly any better. Though New Delhi’s aggressive reactions to the various secessionist uprisings in the country were not directed against the Maoists, they still provided a powerful deterrent effect. Lastly, the social, economic, and political conditions in the country were not conducive to the spread of Naxalite ideology. Political changes at the systemic level gave a new voice to groups the Maoists traditionally relied on for support, making the government more responsive to their needs. As a result, land reforms and rural development became a priority at both the state and national levels. While these programs were not always perfectly implemented, poverty rates did decline, and real and perceived inequity were alleviated to some degree. These issues had been drivers of rural unrest in the previous period, and the government’s efforts to address them proved generally successful in keeping the countryside peaceful during these decades. 56 To most observers in 1991, the Naxalist threat appeared to be over. The movement had been wiped out in the state of its birth, sizeable numbers of its former adherents were embracing electoral democracy, and, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Communism was being discredited around the world. In isolated pockets of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, however, the embers of the Maoist revolution continued to smolder. In places the rural reforms had scarcely reached, the People’s War Group, Maoist Communist Center, and Party Unity continued to cling to existence, waiting for the right moment to reignite the fire of Naxalbari. 57 IV. THE RECONSOLIDATION PERIOD (1991-PRESENT) A. INTRODUCTION With an analysis of the first two periods of Naxalite activity complete, this chapter now turns to the most recent iteration of Maoist violence in India. In an examination of the historical evolution of Naxalism, the period from 1991 to the present is certainly the most paradoxical. In the course of little more than 17 years, India has transformed from a large, but isolated and relatively weak state, to one of the central players in the emerging geopolitical order. Its macroeconomic growth is astounding, second only to China in the developing world, and its diplomatic clout on the world stage has increased commensurately. To many outside observers, India looks to be successfully integrating itself into the modern world. And yet, in those same 17 years, an archaic Communist ideology, rejected even in the place of its birth, was also in the ascendancy. Written off by most security analysts in the ashes of the Fragmentary Period from 1972-1991, Naxalism staged a spectacular comeback in the following decades, growing in scope, breadth, and violence. By 2006, its impact was so great that Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was forced to declare, “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problem of Naxalism is the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”183 This is certainly a startling announcement for a nation that suffered through the chaos of Partition, witnessed the violence of a Sikh rebellion in the Punjab, and is still confronted by the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, various insurgencies in the Northeast, fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and continuing Hindu-Muslim communal strife. What explains Naxalism’s phoenix-like rebirth in a period that has witnessed such phenomenal growth and national development? 183 Manmohan Singh, “Prime Minister’s Speech to the 2nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of Chief Ministers on Naxalism,” 13 April 2006, Government of India Press Information Bureau, http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=17128, (accessed August 10, 2007). 58 B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments Since 1991, the most striking development in Indian politics has been the emergence of a truly multi-polar power structure. The declining hegemony of the INC (discussed in the previous chapter) dramatically accelerated during the 1990s, fuelled by the emergence of the “Three M’s” on the political scene: Mandir, Mandal, and Market Reforms.184 In 1998, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition unseated the previous INC administration and inaugurated the longest period of uninterrupted rule by a non\u0002Congress party since independence. Though the INC returned to power in 2004, the BJP’s ascendancy in the 1990s definitively marked the end of one-party dominance in India, resulting in a more complex and contentious political setting than at any other time in the nation’s history. Minority governments and coalition politics are now the order of the day, severely restricting New Delhi’s freedom of action in addressing many pressing issues. In many ways, this increasing gridlock at the national level is reflected in interactions between the central government and those of the states. India’s political structure is distinctly federal, with the 28 state and 7 union territory governments retaining high levels of autonomy from New Delhi, barring the infrequent imposition of ‘President’s Rule’ from the center. This is particularly true with respect to internal security, an area in which the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India grants the individual states great authority and latitude.185 Such a division of powers presents obvious problems for policy coordination, especially when different parties control the various levels of government. This situation was not much of an issue in earlier decades, 184 ‘Mandir’ refers to Hindu Nationalism, ‘Mandal’ to the recommendations of the Mandal Commission report on the status of backward castes, and ‘Market Reforms’ to the economic reforms inaugurated in 1991. For an excellent exposition of these phenomena and their impact on Indian politics, see: Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952- 2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed.

    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#content) Author ### [Pearl Pandya](https://acleddata.com/staff/pearl-pandya) South Asia Research Manager _On 21 May, Indian security forces killed the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI (Maoist)), Nambala Keshava Rao, also known as Basavaraju, in Chhattisgarh state. He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&nbsp;_ _In this Q&A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world._ ## **The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it?** The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed.[1](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote1) So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( _see graph below_). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.[2](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote2) Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts.[3](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote3) Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. Close footnote ## How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also [targeted locals](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/) whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes.[4](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote4) Close footnote ## What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk.[5](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote5) And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so.

SFs recovered one AK47 rifle, one Light Machine Gun (LMG) and explosives from the encounter spot. The identities of the slain Maoists are yet to be ascertained. On April 5, 2024, one CPI-Maoist cadre was gunned down by SFs in the forest area near Kirandul in the Dantewada District of Chhattisgarh. During the search, SFs recovered the dead body of the Maoist, his weapon and explosives from the encounter site. On April 2, 2024, 13 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in a forest near Lendra village under the Gangaloor Police Station limits of the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh. The identity of the dead Maoists was yet to be ascertained, but _prima facie_, it appeared that they belonged to the Maoist’s PLGA (People's Liberation Guerrilla Army) Company No. 2, a senior Police official disclosed. Police recovered weapons, including a Light Machine Gun (LMG), a .303 rifle, and a 12-bore gun, along with a substantial quantity of barrel grenade launchers, shells, and other arms and ammunition, from the site. On April 1, 2024, two CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in the Kerajhari Forest of the Balaghat District in Madhya Pradesh. The Police recovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist ‘divisional committee member (DCM)’ Sajanti _aka_ Kranti and ‘area committee member (ACM)’ Raghu _aka_ Sher Singh (54), both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounty announcements by the Police in three states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Elsewhere on the same day, one CPI-Maoist cadre was killed in an encounter with SFs in the forest area near Tetemadgu village under Kistaram Police Station limits in the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh. The dead body of the Maoist and his weapons were recovered from the encounter site. The identity of the slain Maoist is yet to be ascertained. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), at least 58 _Naxalites_ \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] have been killed by the SFs during the current year, 2024 (data till April 7). During the corresponding period of 2023, SFs had eliminated nine _Naxalites_. Through 2023, SFs killed 58 _Naxalites_, in addition to 67 killed in 2022. According to the SATP database, SFs arrested 401 _Naxalites_ in 2023 as against 395 arrests in 2022. In 2024, as on April 7, the number of arrests stood at 92. Since March 6, 2000, according to SATP data, 16,364 _Naxalites_ have been arrested (data till April 7, 2024). Through 2023, SFs recovered weapons and ammunition from the Maoists in 223 incidents, in addition to 193 such incidents of recovery in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the number of such incidents was 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,917 incidents of arms recovery are on record. Mounting pressure on the _Naxalites_ has resulted in a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP data, at least 254 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2023, in addition to 2,855 surrenders in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, 42 surrenders have been recorded. Since March 6, 2000, 16,780 _Naxalites_ have surrendered (data till April 7, 2024). Continuing SF successes on the ground further improved the overall security situation through 2023. The trend of declining overall fatalities, on year-on-year basis, in Left Wing Extremism-related violence, has been established since 2018, though a marginal reversal occurred in 2023 at around 11.11 per cent (from 135 in 2022 to 150 in 2023). According to SATP data, a total of 150 people (61 civilians, 31 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_) were killed in such violence through 2023, as against 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) recorded in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the total number of such fatalities stood at 93 (22 civilians, 13 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_), as against 37 such fatalities (19 civilians, nine SF personnel and nine _Naxalites_) reported during the corresponding period of 2023. According to SATP data, the number of civilian fatalities (61) recorded through 2023 was the third lowest in this category since 2000. Two other previous lows were recorded at 53 in 2022 and 58 in 2021. A third low of 61 was also recorded in 2020. The maximum number of civilians killed in such violence, 630, was in 2010. Though the number of fatalities among SFs increased from 15 in 2022 to 31 in 2023, according to SATP data, the number of fatalities in 2023 was the second lowest in this category since 2000. A previous low of 15 was recorded in 2022. The maximum number of SFs killed in such violence, 319, was in 2009. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2023, at 1:1.87, improving the ratio in favour of the SFs in 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2022, the ratio was at 1:4.46, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Also, in 2009 the ratio was at 1.01:1. In 2007, the ratio was at 1.2:1 favouring the Maoists. However, since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.63). In the current year, the kill ratio remains in favour of the SFs at 1:4.46, so far (data till April 7, 2024). Other parameters of violence indicate that, despite sustained SF pressure, the Maoists but retain significant operational capabilities across the country. At least eight major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) were recorded in 2023, compared to seven such incidents in 2022. There were 89 incidents of exchange of fire between SFs and Maoist in 2023, compared to 86 such incidents in 2022. Further, the Maoists orchestrated at least 62 incidents of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in 2023, compared to 32 such incidents in 2022. Moreover, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents of violence increased marginally from 602 in 2022 to 603 in 2023. In particular, incidents in which the Maoists killed civilians and SFs increased from 63 in 2022 to 77 in 2023. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from 12 States in 2023, in comparison to 10 States in 2022. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 12 affected States have a total of 83 Districts which recorded a Maoist presence. Of these, seven districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 20 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 56 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2022, of 57 affected districts from 10 states, two districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 27 were ‘marginally affected’. However, in a written reply to a question in the _Rajya Sabha_ (Upper House of the Indian Parliament) on February 7, 2024, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai claimed that the resolute implementation of the “National Policy and Action Plan (NPAP) to address LWE” approved in 2015, resulted in a consistent decline in violence and constriction of the geographical spread of LWE influence. LWE-related violence and resultant deaths (Civilians + Security Forces) declined by 73 per cent from a high in 2010, by 90 per cent in 2022, and by 86 per cent in 2023. Further, Rai stated that the number of Police Stations reporting LWE-related violence had reduced significantly, from 465 Police Stations across 96 districts in 2010 to 176 Police Stations across 45 districts in 2022 and 171 Police Stations across 42 districts in 2023. Clearly, all major LWE-affected states across the country – see Andhra Pradesh’s **[Residual Vexations](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-29#assessment2)**, Bihar’s **[Halted Menace](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-35#assessment2)**, Chhattisgarh’s **[Persisting Disruptions](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-33#assessment2)**, Jharkhand’s **[Risks amidst decline](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-31#assessment2)**, Madhya Pradesh’s **[Enduring Risks](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-41#assessment2)**, Maharashtra’s **[Ineffective ‘Revival’](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-36#assessment2)**, Odisha’s **[Enduring challenges](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-34#assessment2)**, and Telangana’s **[Sustained Dominance](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-37#assessment2)** have recorded substantial improvement in the security situation in the regions affected by LWE activity. Earlier, on January 21, 2024, the union home minister (UHM) Amit Shah, had asserted that the country would be free from the menace of _Naxalism_ in the next three years, and directed states to expedite development activities in remote areas affected by the ultras. UHM Shah also directed the Security Forces (SFs) to financially choke the ultras and instructed officials to prepare a blueprint to end _Naxalism_. He also stressed the need for expediting development in _Naxalite_-affected areas, asserting that all welfare schemes of the central and state governments would have to be implemented in these areas with renewed vigour. Meanwhile, on January 11, 2024, the Chhattisgarh government invited Maoists to hold unconditional talks, suggesting \"video calls if they are reluctant to come for physical meetings\". Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma, who holds the state's Home portfolio, stating that this would be a step towards restoring peace and stability in the Bastar region, thus observed, | | | --- | | We are prepared to provide Naxalites an online platform to express their grievances, ideas and desires. I am open to discussions with the young cadres any time, 24x7, without any conditions. I am available for any topic the Naxalites wish to discuss, but they must be willing to engage. If they regret their decision to join the outfit or wish to reintegrate with mainstream society, I extend my hand to them and urge them to lead a peaceful life and serve the country. | While holding out an olive branch, the Government made it clear that there would be no softening of stance. The Deputy Chief Minister thus warned, | | | --- | | If they fail to grasp the importance of dialogue, they will have to pay for the pain they have inflicted on our people ('dard ka hisaab hoga'). They must understand that peace talks cannot occur with guns and bullets. A well-ordered society is not governed by firearms. We want to discuss what they desire, why they carry weapons, why they mislead and trouble people, why they oppose progress in villages, and why they do not support the establishment of hospitals, schools, water facilities, and _anganwadis_. | Meanwhile, according to a March 21, 2024, media report, Chhattisgarh's Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma's call for unconditional dialogue with Maoists prompted a response from the CPI-Maoist, with the rebels presenting certain preconditions and emphasizing the necessity of a conducive environment for talks to ensure the welfare and lasting peace of oppressed and exploited segments of society. In a letter, CPI-Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) 'spokesman' Vikalp outlined several conditions before any agreement could be reached to engage in dialogue. These conditions included the cessation of atrocities and false encounters on tribals, halting militarization in tribal regions, withdrawing security forces, and annulling agreements with corporate entities. In a two-page letter dated March 15, 2024, Maoist spokesperson Vikalp declared that, if their demands were met, they would be ready to engage in dialogue via mobile phone calls. He noted, further, | | | --- | | We had previously responded to the invitation for talks, stating that our central agenda is none other than the overall development of the oppressed and harassed sections of society, including tribal, Dalit, Muslim, and minority communities, as well as farmers, women, and the middle class. Additionally, we advocate for equal pay for equal work based on gender equality and an end to state violence against women. | Vikalp also insisted on providing loan waivers for farmers, increasing agricultural subsidies, providing free irrigation and electricity, cancelling agreements with international companies, and implementing welfare schemes such as free education, housing, healthcare, and employment. The Maoists thus gave _bandh_ (general shut down strike) calls on their whims. In their latest call on March 30, 2024, the Maoists called for a _bandh_ in Bijapur and Sukma on April 3, 2024, to protest the killing of six Maoists in an encounter in the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh on March 27, 2024, which the rebels claimed was a \"fake encounter\". However, the _bandh_ calls were peaceful. Rejecting the allegations of fake encounters as \"old tactics\" of the Maoists, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar range, Sundarraj P., asserted, | | | --- | | It is the typical _modus operandi_ of Maoists to level allegations against the security forces to puncture the credibility of security forces. Maoists conveniently forget that they are responsible for brutal killings of hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians. Just to distract the attention from their inhumane behaviour, they issue these kinds of statements. All concerned understand the reality that the Maoists are facing their extinction. | Earlier, on March 26, 2024, Mohan, the ‘secretary’ of the CPI-Maoist West Bastar Division Committee, had issued a press note which announced that Bijapur would remain closed on March 30. In the note the Maoist leader accused the Police of killing 15 tribals since January. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government in Chhattisgarh has been accused of fake encounters, atrocities, and the eviction of tribals from forests and land, and denial of access to water resources. The Maoists warned transporters and businessmen that they would be responsible if they operated on March 30. However, the _bandh_ passed without any disruptive activities. The Maoists issued nine _Bandh_ calls in 2023 across the country, as against eight such calls in 2022. The Maoist movement has weakened, as the SFs now increasingly dominate areas long under LWE sway. Nevertheless, the capacities to sustain dominance remain limited. According to _Bureau of Police Research and Development_ (BPR&D) data, the all-India Police-population ratio was 152.80 (as on January 1, 2022), in comparison to 152.51 per 100,000 on January 1, 2021. Some of the Maoists’ affected States have much worse police-population ratios: Bihar, at 75.16; Odisha at 122.59; and Maharashtra at 136.45. Even in States like Jharkhand, where the police-population ratio, at 162.73, exceeds the national average, it remains much lower than the 220/100,000 ratio regarded as desirable for 'peacetime policing'. Moreover, there were 504 (17.59 per cent) vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) in the 12 affected States, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. Further, huge vacancies persist in the total strength of the State Police forces, which have been increasingly used in the fight against the _Naxalites_: there were 417,784 vacant posts in the 12 affected States, as on January 1, 2022, against a sanctioned strength of 1,642,759 (actual strength: 1,224,965). Significantly, these constituted 72.3 per cent of the 595,105 vacant posts across India, as on January 1, 2022. Moreover, against a sanctioned strength of 324,654 in the CRPF, the lead counter-insurgency Force in the country, the actual strength stood at 309,544, a vacancy of 15,110 personnel. Stark deficits are visible in some of the worst afflicted States. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2022, there were at least 22 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst _Naxalism_-affected State, which did not have a telephone. Similarly, the second worst affected State, Jharkhand, had 211 such Police Stations without telephone connections. The number of Police Stations without a vehicle in Jharkhand was 47, while 31 Police stations in the state hand no wireless/mobile phone. The Maoists are certainly losing their impact across the country; however, the danger of resurgence remains alive. There is urgent need to build the necessary capacities to sustain, indeed, heighten pressure at this stage, in order to consolidate the gains of recent years. | [Assessments Year

The slain Maoists were identified as Gautam Paswan, CPI-Maoist ‘Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee (BJSAC)’ member, who had a reward of INR 2.5 million on his head; Ajit Oraon _alias_ Charlis, BJSAC member, with an INR 2.5 million reward; Amar Ganjhu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; Ajay Yadav _alias_ Nandu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; and Sanjeet Bhuiyan, ‘sub-zonal commander’. During the search operation, the dead bodies of the five Maoists along with two AK-47 rifles, one INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, two other rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as items of daily use were recovered. On April 1, 2023, a CPI-Maoist cadre, Sameer Mohonda _alias_ Sadhu Linga (31), a member of the CPI-Maoist ‘Chatgaon Local Organizational Squad’, with a reward of INR 200,000 on his head, was killed in an encounter with C-60 Commandos in the Kiarkoti-Abujhmad Forest area of Bhamragarh _Taluka_ (revenue division) in the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra. Acting on intelligence inputs, the Commandos launched an operation and came under indiscriminate fire from a group of 60 to 70 Maoists hiding in the forest, who used Under Barrel Grenade Launchers (UBGLs) and other weapons. In the retaliatory fire, the C-60 Commandos killed one Maoist, while the others managed to flee into the dense forest. After the firing, which lasted for approximately an hour, the Security Forces (SFs) searched the area and recovered one .303 rifle, one gun, a country-made pistol, three magazines, 31 bullets, INR 38,000, medicines, Maoist literature and other materials. On March 28, 2023, a former deputy _Sarpanch_ (head of the _Panchayat_, village level local self-Government institution), Ramji Dodi, was abducted and killed by CPI-Maoist cadres in Zara village in the Narayanpur District of Chhattisgarh. Dodi was abducted, along with his two nephews, and taken to a forest where he was allegedly strangled to death by the Maoists. The nephews were released with Ramji’s body and a letter saying that he was killed because he was a ‘police informer’. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), there has been a total of 39 fatalities (20 civilians, nine SF personnel and 10 _Naxalites_, Left Wing Extremists) in Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-linked violence in the current year (data till April 9, 2023). During the corresponding period of 2022, the number of such fatalities was 49 (19 civilians, seven SF personnel and 23 _Naxalites_). Through 2022, there was a total of 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) in such violence. In the preceding year (2021), there was a total of 237 fatalities (58 civilians, 51 SF personnel, and 128 _Naxalites_). Overall fatalities were at 239 in 2020, 302 in 2019, 412 in 2018 and 335 in 2017. Overall fatalities have, thus, been on a decline since 2019. Moreover, the overall fatalities in 2022 were the lowest recorded in a single year since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE. Interestingly, the overall fatalities in 2021 were the pervious lowest recorded in a single year. A peak of 1,180 fatalities (630 civilians, 267 SF personnel, 265 _Naxalites_ and 18 unspecified) were recorded in 2010. As with overall fatalities, fatalities in 2022 in all three categories – civilian, SF and _Naxalite_ – were the lowest since 2000. A previous low of 58 in the civilian category was record in 2021. In the SF category, the previous low of 44 was recorded in 2020. A previous low of 87 in the _Naxalite_ category was recorded in 2004. Civilian and _Naxalite_ fatalities have also been on a continuous decline since 2019. SF fatalities have also declined through this period, barring 2021 (51 fatalities) when there was a spike compared to 2020 (44 fatalities). Other parameters of violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation relating to LWE activities across the country. The number of overall LWE-linked terrorist incidents fell from 676 in 2021 to 602 in 2022. In particular, incidents of killing came down from 124 in 2021 to 107 in 2022. Seven of the 107 overall incidents of killing were major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in 2022. In 2021, the number of major incidents was 15. Resultant fatalities from major incidents declined from 114 (seven civilians, 30 SF personnel, and 77 _Naxalites_) in 2021 to 22 (one civilian, three SF personnel, and 18 _Naxalites_) in 2022. In 2023, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents was 169, of which 32 were incidents of killing. Two major incidents have already been recorded in 2023. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2022, at 1:4.46, the best since 2000, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2021, the ratio was at 1:2.5. The ratio has remined in favour of the SFs since 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.61). In the current year, the kill ratio is in favour of the SFs at 1:1.11, so far (data till April 6, 2023). SFs arrested 395 _Naxalites_ in 2022, in addition to 409 in 2021, according to partial data compiled by SATP. In the current year, as on April 6, 2023, 122 arrests had been recorded. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, a total of 15,993 has been recorded. The mounting pressure on _Naxalites_ has yielded a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP, at least 2,855 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2022, in addition to 533 in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of surrenders was 97. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 16,581 LWEs have surrendered. Through 2022, SFs recovered arms from the Maoists in 190 incidents, in addition to 268 such incidents of recovery in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of such incidents are 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,694 incidents of arms recovery are documented. An analysis of over-ground and underground Maoist activities in the country’s LWE-affected areas also suggests a diminishing influence. According to SATP, in 2022, Maoist activities were reported from 10 States in comparison to 11 States in 2021. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 10 affected States have a total of 310 Districts, of which 58 recorded a Maoist presence. Of these 58, three districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 27 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 28 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2021, of 79 affected districts, one district fell in the ‘extremely-affected’ category, four in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 46 were ‘marginally affected’. Indeed, on March 28, 2023, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, in a written reply to a question in the _Lok Sabha_ (Lower House of the Indian Parliament), announced that the number of districts most affected by LWE had reduced from 35 in 2017 to 30 in April 2018, and then to 25 in July **[2021](https://pqals.nic.in/annex/1711/AU4464.pdf)**. Further, on March 28, 2023, the Government stated that the “geographical spread of violence has significantly reduced and only 176 Police Stations of 45 districts reported LWE violence in 2022, as compared to a high of 465 Police Stations of 96 districts in 2010”. Conspicuously, all major LWE-affected states across the country — **[Andhra Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-30)**, **[Bihar](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-31#assessment2)**, **[Chhattisgarh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-29#assessment2)**, **[Jharkhand](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-33#assessment2)**, **[Kerala](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-39#assessment2)**, **[Madhya Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-40#assessment2)**, **[Maharashtra](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-38#assessment2)**, **[Odisha](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-34#assessment2)**, and **[Telangana](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-37)** have witnessed an overall improvement in the security situation. Nevertheless, the Maoist challenge persists. OThe Perilous **[Bastar Division](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-22#assessment2)**, the safe haven of the residual Maoist problem not only in Chhattisgarh but across the entire LWE-affected region, comprising seven densely forested districts - Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur and Sukma - sprawling across 40,000 square kilometers, in the southernmost region of the state, is the location of the last Maoist bastions. On November 7, 2022, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar Range, Sundarraj P., asserting that the SFs were committed to wiping out the Maoist threat, nevertheless accepted, | | | --- | | In Bastar Range, though civilian killings have reduced to a great extent, from 279 in the year 2006, to 29 in 2022, it is still an area of major concern in left-wing extremist affected areas. | Indeed, on March 28, 2023, the Maoists abducted and killed two villagers, in Narayanpur and Sukma Districts, branding them as ‘Police informers’ (incidents mentioned above). Moreover, the early data for 2023 suggests that SF dominance on the ground, purely in terms of the kill ratio, has weakened during the first three months of 2023, as compared to the whole of 2022 and earlier. Not surprisingly, civilian insecurity has escalated. Disturbingly, more than a few deficits in the fighting forces remained noticeable in some of the worst Maoist-afflicted States, according to the _Bureau of Police Research & Development_ (BPR&D) data. BPR&D disclosed, as on January 1, 2021, that there were at least 28 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst affected State, that had no telephone. In Jharkhand, 47 had no vehicle, 211 had no telephone, and 31 had no wireless/mobile connectivity. In Andhra Pradesh, 65 Police Stations had no vehicle, and 34 had no wireless/mobile connectivity; and in Odisha, four had no vehicle, and three had no telephone. Moreover, large vacancies persist in the State Police Forces. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2021, against the sanctioned strength of 1,109,260 there were a total of 838,481 policemen in position in 10 LWE-affected States, leaving a vacancy of 270,779, i.e., 24.41 per cent. At the national level, deficits against sanctioned strength were 20.34 per cent, almost the same as the shortage in the Maoist affected States. The police-population ratio (policemen per hundred thousand population) of these 12 States had increased from an average of 138.63 in 2018 to 149.42 in 2019. Meanwhile, the all-India police-population ratio had increased from 150.80 in 2018 to 158.22 in 2019, significantly higher than the levels in the LWE affected States. Importantly, existing police-population ratios in these 12 states remained significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 183.97. At the national level, the existing levels were also significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 198.65 per 100,000. Moreover, the number of vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) of these 12 States was 595 (22.44 per cent), as against 948 (19.97 per cent) at the national level, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. These critical deficiencies in the enforcement apparatuses need urgent attention if the gains against the Maoists are to be consolidated further. The Maoists are down, but yet not out. The overall declining trend in Maoist violence and activity across the country needs to be contained with further security interventions with a sense of urgency, as the Maoists have shown incredible capacities for resurrection in the past, and retain substantial operational and overground capabilities in significant areas of their erstwhile regions of dominance. The SFs will have to overcome prevailing operational and capacity deficits, to prevent any rebel resurgence. | [Assessments Year

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with “unspecified casualties” on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi’s China and Modi’s India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China’s ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China’s abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India’s protest in denying Beijing’s claims as “exaggerated and untenable” is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi’s “clarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat”_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India’s active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China’s nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India’s nuclear strike range_** **_(right) – estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India’s national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China’s “containment of India,” the modernization of the PLA and its “growing assertiveness on the border”, and recommended a shift of India’s national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China’s unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or “string of pearls” that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India’s security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India’s peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China’s energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China’s power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China’s “Malacca dilemma,” by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing’s interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of “the quad”, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing’s ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India’s nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India’s boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India’s dismay. When BRI’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India’s doctrine of “strategic autonomy”. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek “equivalence” with the great powers — China, Russia, US — in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi’s party and support the base’s nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem “techno-nationalism”.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India’s dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India’s military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China’s relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. Commensurate to China’s 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a “peaceful rise” of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world’s longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India’s options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India’s strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India’s preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India’s “Neighborhood First” policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi’s ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal’s stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the “Asian Century” may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India’s geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide “chicken’s neck” connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China’s favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi’s strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India’s advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ”partners” with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh’s deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China’s border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its “like-minded partners” in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India’s diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war – for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India’s irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China’s assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-à-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, “wolf-warrior diplomacy”, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India – the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its “NORMS — New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System” approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India’s quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact – an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China – to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia – India’s soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter’s unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese “iron brother”, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China’s increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India’s disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled. In the _Art of War_, Sun Tzu posits, “a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.”\\[31\\] In their international positioning, whether it will be India or China’s thinking and preparedness that is victorious, only the real geopolitical battle will tell — one that far exceeds the LAC battlegrounds. * * * **References** [_**\\[1\\]**_](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/india-china-standoff-from-precarious-peace-to-the-point-of-no-return/?srsltid=AfmBOopMYRpkammY3JbuSv0VQLBVgNroFN1MwcBzigwT7ZYGZBeChO-Y#_ednref1) _Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas, New Delhi, November 29, 1996, United Nations Peacemaker, available from_( [https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%20IN\\_961129\\_Agreement%20between%20China%20and%20India.pdf](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%2520IN_961129_Agreement%2520between%2520China%2520and%2520India.pdf)).

India has seen a sharp rise in cyberattacks over the last few years, which has turned data protection into a top security concern. According to **CERT-IN,** between **2021 and mid-2025,** India recorded more than **2.2 million** cybersecurity incidents, averaging more than **3,000 attacks per day,** with financial services, healthcare, telecom, and government platforms among the hardest hit. Hackers focused on cloud misconfigurations, unpatched servers, and weak internal access controls. The list below tracks **25 major cyberattacks in India** from 2021 to 2025, showing how they happened and what strategies can be used to prevent similar breaches. ## **1\\. Angel One AWS resource breach/potential data leakage, February 2025** Angel One, India's largest broking firm, was recently hacked. Hackers gained access to an unsecured AWS storage bucket linked to it, exposing the sensitive data of **7.9 million** users, such as trading details, email addresses, and customer IDs. Cloud management made sensitive data visible on public servers. To avoid such scams, similar companies must audit all cloud buckets, enable encryption, and always restrict public access through IAM (Identity and Access Management) rules. ## **2\\. AI-generated Phishing and Infostealer Surge, 2025** In 2025, several Indian banks and fintech platforms reported a rise in AI-generated phishing scams. Attackers used a realistic, AI-written email to fool users into giving away credentials. Thousands have already fallen victim to these smarter phishing campaigns by unknowingly entering their bank credentials, leading to financial losses and identity theft. Attackers also used voice cloning and deepfake technology to impersonate officials, which makes the deception look more convincing. One must consider the fact that constant user training, spam filters, and AI-based email scanning tools block most phishing messages before they reach inboxes. ## **3\\. Aditya Birla Capital Digital (ABCD) App Hack, 2025** Hackers targeted a weakness in the ABCD mobile app API, revealing customers' loan and PAN details. The attackers targeted unprotected endpoints, which allows data scraping. API vulnerabilities remain a growing concern for finance apps. However, routine code audits with secure token validation and regular app updates can stop such data exposure. ## **4\\. Star Health Threats, May 2025** Star Health, one of India's largest health insurers, experienced a major data breach that affected 31 million policyholders; much of the core information, including medical records, insurance details, and personal information, was breached and even published on the dark web. This breach shows how healthcare data can be exploited for identity theft. Encrypting health records, segmenting sensitive systems, and ensuring continuous monitoring can reduce such risks. ## **5\\. Delhi Hospitals Ransomware Attack, June 2025** Delhi's **Sant Parmanand** and **NKS Super Speciality** hospitals were targeted by ransomware that locked almost all patient and billing data. Over **60,000 records** were affected by this attack. The attack used phishing emails to deliver ransomware payloads. The malware spread quickly through unprotected hospital networks. Hospitals should isolate administrative and patient data systems, train staff to identify suspicious emails, and maintain offline data backups. ## **6\\. Kolkata Police Cyber Crime Wing Data Breach, August 2025** Weak internal passwords and a lack of access control allowed hackers to access internal police systems, where investigation details from the Cyber Wing in Kolkata were leaked. This breach exposed officer credentials and case data. The attack raised alarms about insider threats and the need for stronger law enforcement cybersecurity. Police and law enforcement agencies should adopt role-based access control, enforce password rotations, and enable two-factor authentication for internal systems. ## **7\\. Multiple Cyberattacks on Indian Governments, 2024.** Multiple state e-governance portals were hacked in 2024, leaking citizen Aadhaar and bank details. At least **2.5 million** records were compromised across several platforms. Many portals lacked basic HTTPS encryption, which allowed attackers to exploit outdated plugins and weak admin passwords. That's why regular CMS updates, secure admin logins, and government-wide cybersecurity policies are vital for protection. Every e-governance platform must undergo quarterly vulnerability assessments and follow a national cybersecurity standard to protect public data. ## **8\\. Polycab Ransomware Attack, March 2024** Polycab India, a top cable manufacturer, suffered a ransomware attack, causing a **Rs 20 crore** operational loss. The breach started from an infected employee workstation and ended with hackers encrypting internal files and demanding high payments. The attack also affected the supplier and distributor network, exposing the ripple effect of industrial cyber incidents. ## **9\\. Indian Energy Sector Attack, 2024** This breach shows the exposure of operational technology systems, where hackers tried to infiltrate India's power grid through malware-infected email attachments sent to energy employees. The attack aimed to disrupt the electricity supply but was quickly contained. **Tip:** Separating IT and OT networks and constantly monitoring power infrastructure can prevent major outages like this. Moreover, conducting red team simulations and regular cybersecurity drills helps reduce the chance of large-scale blackouts. ## **10\\. BSNL Data Breach, May 2024** Personal details of **2.9 million** broadband subscribers were leaked from a BSNL database due to old, unpatched systems. Leaked data included phone numbers and service details. The breach came from a neglected internal server. The outdated system, left without proper monitoring, became an easy entry point. Updating infrastructure and restricting admin access can prevent similar service providers. **Read Also: [Top 30 Best-Known Cybersecurity Case Studies 2025](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-best-known-cybersecurity-case-studies)** ## **11\\. UP Marriage Assistance Scheme Leak, 2024** The Uttar Pradesh Marriage Assistance Scheme is a welfare initiative aimed at helping low-income families. Data from the welfare portal of Uttar Pradesh leaked, including Aadhaar, bank details, and contact information, affecting **200,000** applicants. The data was found indexed on search engines, shockingly. The root cause was traced to poor web server configuration and missing access restrictions. A web firewall and regular penetration testing could have prevented this from happening. ## **12\\. Airtel India Customer Database Leak (375 Million Users), June 2024** Hackers claimed to sell a database of **375 million** users, which would be nearly **25%** of India's population. Airtel denied the break, but the data was widely shared online. The leak included Aadhaar numbers and personal details. Even if false, it revealed risks from third-party data handling. Telecom companies must run vendor audits and apply zero-trust security across all databases, anonymising customer data wherever possible to reduce exposure if leaks occur. ## **13\\. WazirX Hack, July 2024** Crypto firms must use cold wallets for storage and conduct third-party code audits before deploying smart contracts. WazirX, a crypto exchange, was targeted by hackers who were exploiting blockchain smart contract vulnerabilities. Roughly **$230 million** worth of assets were at risk. This breach clearly highlights that public blockchain code, if left unaudited, can create hidden backdoors. ## **14\\. boAt India Data Breach, 2023** Encrypting user data and applying hashed passwords are key to securing e-commerce databases. In 2023, an unsecured server was recently exposed, exposing **7.5 million** customer records, including names and contact information. The leak spread on Telegram and hacking forums. Weak password protection made recovery even harder. Many users later reported spam calls and targeted ads due to leaked data. ## **15\\. Telangana Police's Hawk Eye App Data Breach, 2023** Hackers accessed the Hawk Eye mobile app, revealing user profiles and feedback reports. The app, meant for citizen safety, accidentally exposed personal data through a misconfigured API. Public-facing government apps should use token-based access, secure API gateways and regular security reviews before each software update. **Read Also: [Top 50 Cyber Security Projects for Final Year Students (2025 Edition)](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-25-cyber-security-projects-for-final-year-students)** ## **16\\. Hyundai Motor India Data Leak, 2023** Thousands of car owners whose contact and vehicle details were stolen were found on the dark web. The source of the breach was traced to a third-party vendor responsible for managing the dealer's database. Weak vendor access controls and outdated security measures worsened the system, risking identity misuse because the data appeared on dark web forums for sale. ## **17\\. SPARSH Data Breach, 2023** The Ministry of Defence's SPARSH portal suffered a breach, which exposed pensioner IDs and bank details. Hackers used credential stuffing techniques on weak passwords. This breach raised national security concerns as the portal handled sensitive military data. Multi-factor authentication, stronger password policies, and regular login behaviour analysis can stop similar attacks. ## **18\\. Sun Pharma Cyber Attack, 2023** Pharmaceutical giant Sun Pharma's ransomware disrupted its internal operations and supply chain, causing **Rs. 30 crore** in losses. Hackers entered through a phishing email and encrypted internal servers. Companies should train employees to identify phishing attempts, install anti-ransomware software, and maintain offline data backups for rapid recovery. ## **19\\. BharatPe Hacked: August 2022** Phishing emails led to a breach of employees' inboxes, leaking internal documents and financial reports. The attackers used social engineering to mimic trusted contacts, tricking employees into sharing login credentials. While no customer data was stolen, the breach hurt investor confidence. Using email MFA, spam filters, and awareness campaigns can block future phishing attempts. ## **20\\. Cyberattack on AIIMS: December 2022** India's top hospital, AIIMS, suffered a ransomware attack that took **3 million** patient records. The servers remained slow for approximately two weeks, which caused major disruption. **Read Also: [The Rise of Agentic AI in Cyber Warfare: Implications for Global Security](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/the-rise-of-agentic-ai-in-cyber-warfare-implications-for-global-security)** ## **21\\. CloudSEK Data Breach: December 2022** In 2022, hackers stole internal data from the cybersecurity firm CloudSEK and exposed API keys on **GitHub.** The breach revealed how even security companies can be vulnerable. Never use credentials in code repositories, and rotate all access tokens regularly. ## **22\\. Swachhta Platform Hacked, September 2022** Hackers breached India's Swachh Bharat (Clean India) platform, a government site that collected public sanitation feedback and cleanliness reports. The attackers took advantage of outdated CMS plugins and weak credentials, allowing them to deface the homepage and delete parts of the citizen feedback database. ## **23\\. Zivame Data Breach, 2022** In 2022, Indian lingerie retailer Zivame experienced an excessive data breach exposing personal and transactional information of nearly **1.5 million** customers. The data included names, phone numbers, email addresses and partially masked payment records. Investigators traced the cause to an unsecured database server left open to the public without password protection. The leaked dataset appeared later on dark web forums for sale. ## **24\\. Air India / SITA Passenger Data Breach, 2021** Recently, in 2021, a global cyberattack on SITA, the IT provider for various airlines, exposed personal data of over **4.5 million** Air India passengers, which included passport details, ticket numbers, birth dates, and contact information. The breach was traced to unauthorised access in SITA's passenger service system, which connected multiple airlines worldwide, compromising long-term passenger privacy. That's why airlines and travel companies must vet all external vendors for compliance with strict cybersecurity standards, enforce encryption for shared databases and deploy continuous threat detection across connected systems. ## **25\\. Domino's India Customer Data Leak, 2021** Hackers exposed nearly **180 million** customer order details, including their names, phone numbers and even GPS coordinates. Attackers used an unsecured server within the company's order-tracking infrastructure, and later they published the full dataset on the dark web. The exposed location information was essentially alarming, as it could reveal customers' routines and residential details. Companies handling location-based services should encrypt all customer data, mask stored addresses and set strict retention periods for order records. **Read Also: [Zero Trust Security: The Future of Cyber Defense](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/zero-trust-security-the-future-of-cyber-defense)** ## **In the End** India's cybersecurity reflects both rapid progress and rising exposure. Attackers have now shifted to multi-stage ransomware, insider misuse, and AI-generated phishing. Organisations that invested early in zero-trust controls, employee awareness programmes, and regular threat monitoring have contained incidents faster and have limited damage. Every sector, private or public, must treat cybersecurity as an **operational priority** rather than a compliance task tied to reputation, customer trust, and business continuity. ## **Frequently Asked Questions** ### **Which sector faces the most cyber threats in India?** The financial, healthcare, telecom and e-commerce sectors top the list due to their high data value. Banking APIs, digital payment apps, and hospital systems are common ransomware and credential theft targets. ### **What are the main reasons behind the rise in cyberattacks in India?** The main reasons are rapid digitisation, weak password habits, over-reliance on cloud storage without proper encryption, and phishing campaigns using AI-written messages. ### **How can individuals protect themselves from data leaks in India?** Use unique passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, avoid public Wi-Fi for banking, and never click unknown links in SMS or WhatsApp messages.

Shah](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/kriti-m-shah) _The citizens’ right to protest is a pillar of Indian democracy. While citizens are allowed to peacefully assemble, however, protests and demonstrations sometimes take a violent turn; recent examples are the Jat protests in Haryana and the Kashmir unrest following the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, both in 2016. During such occasions, it is the prerogative of the Indian state to deal with the violent civil protests in a manner that ensures public order and protects citizens from harm. This paper discusses the use of force by security officials during periods of violent civil unrest and seeks to understand the ways and means of dealing with such protests in the country._ ## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

    "full_text": "top of page Search ## **World Environmental Health Day 2024** World Environmental Health Day 2024 focuses on the theme \"Environmental Health: Creating Resilient Communities through Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation.\" This theme underscores the critical need to enhance community resilience in the face of climate-related disasters, which have become increasingly frequent and severe due to global warming. By emphasizing disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation, this year's theme calls for integrated approaches that not only protect public health but also ensure sustainable development. India's unique geography and climate make it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. With 27 out of 29 states and 7 union territories susceptible to natural hazards like floods, cyclones, droughts, and earthquakes, the country faces an uphill battle against the devastating impacts of climate change. As World Environmental Health Day 2024 approaches, it's crucial for India to take bold steps to enhance community resilience and protect its vulnerable populations. ### Geographical Factors Contributing to Disaster Risk India's geographical factors significantly contribute to its disaster risk profile, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The combination of its diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors creates a complex landscape of [vulnerabilities](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf): - [**Earthquakes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.7059oimyb6r3): Approximately 58.6% of India's landmass is susceptible to earthquakes, with the country situated in a seismically active zone due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. - [**Coastal Vulnerability**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.sipw79xc52s): India's coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, exposes it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. - [**Floods**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.af8gn4f1799i) and [**droughts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.xdkivgfc02df): about 40 million hectares (around 12% of the land) are prone to floods and river erosion, while 68% of cultivable land is vulnerable to droughts. - [**Landslides**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.kmor8crhvnf7) and avalanches: The hilly regions are also at risk from landslides and avalanches, further compounding the disaster risk faced by various communities across the nation. #### Seismic Activity India is situated at the convergence of several tectonic plates, making it prime for earthquakes. ~58% of the country’s landmass is classified as being at risk for earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity. This seismic vulnerability is particularly pronounced in regions such as the Himalayan belt, which experiences tremors due to ongoing tectonic activity. ##### The Gujarat (Bhuj) Earthquake (2001) For instance, the [2001 Bhuj earthquake](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bhuj-earthquake-of-2001), which registered a magnitude of 7.7, resulted in over 20,000 deaths and injured more than 150,000 others. The earthquake affected approximately 28 million people, destroyed more than 400,000 buildings, with the telecom building collapsing, Bhuj was isolated from the rest of the state; the most seriously affected was the Kandla port (the busiest port in India) which caters to handling crucial imports of petroleum products, crude oil and chemicals and export of agricultural commodities, with about five of the 10 jetties damaged. Over 10,000 small and medium industrial units had to stop production due to damage to plants, factories, and machinery. The Indian State Department [estimates](https://www.adrc.asia/publications/recovery_reports/Gujarat.pdf) that the earthquake affected, directly or indirectly, 15.9 million people out of 37.8 million. The government estimated the direct economic loss at $1.3 billion, while estimates indicate this could be as high as $5 billion. Following the earthquake, emergency relief operations were launched by both government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs): - [ActionAid India](https://www.actionaidindia.org/emergency/gujarat-earthquake-2001/) mobilized local community-based organizations to provide immediate assistance in the most affected areas, by establishing temporary shelters, distributed food and medical supplies, and set up psycho-social counseling services for survivors. - The government initiated a [comprehensive rehabilitation plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm) that included new building codesto ensure that the structures were designed to be earthquake-resistant; and infrastructure redevelopment of roads, schools, hospitals, and utilities was prioritized. - Emphasizing on community participation in planning and implementing disaster management strategies, village-level committees were formed to enhance local capacity for disaster response. - A [State Disaster Management Plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm#:~:text=Gujarat%20State%20Disaster%20Management%20Authority%20(GSDMA)%2C%20which%20would%20implement%20the%20reconstruction%20and%20rehabilitation%2C%20with%20support%20from%20various%20other%20agencies%20in%20the%20quake%2Dhit%20area.) was created that integrated lessons learned from the earthquake, and focused on risk assessment, early warning systems, and community-based disaster management practices aimed at reducing vulnerability to future seismic events. The resilience-building activities undertaken after the Gujarat earthquake reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate relief with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. These efforts underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in seismically active regions like India #### Coastal Vulnerability India's long coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, makes it highly vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis, [exposing](https://irade.org/Sustainable%20and%20Disaster%20Resilient%20Urban%20DevelopmentFinal%20.pdf) it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. This vulnerability is particularly pronounced in states like Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, which have borne the brunt of devastating cyclones in recent years. ###### Cyclone Fani (2019) Cyclone Fani, which made landfall in Odisha on May 3, 2019, serves as a prime example of the destruction that coastal areas face. The [extremely severe](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/cyclone-fani-damage-loss-and-needs-assessment) cyclonic storm caused extensive damage across 14 districts in Odisha, [affecting](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2019-000041-ind) at least 10 million people in the North-eastern Sates of India. Despite the early evacuation of a million people, the cyclone has severely affected the lives and livelihoods of more than 28 million people across 3 States in India. [Total damage](https://ncds.nic.in/sites/default/files/OEDS3NCDS.pdf) to existing stock of assets has been estimated at over $2.4 billion, whereas the economic losses flowing from the disaster are estimated at nearly ~$1.1 billion. In response to the devastation caused by Cyclone Fani, several resilience-building activities were implemented to enhance disaster preparedness and recovery efforts: - [The Government of Odisha](https://www.unicef.org/media/82111/file/India-Cyclone-Fani-SitRep-12-May-2019.pdf) coordinated one of the largest emergency preparedness exercises, mobilizing over 45,000 volunteers and 100,000 officials to ensure effective communication and evacuation protocols. This effort enabled the successful evacuation of approximately 1.47 million people from low-lying areas before the cyclone made landfall. - The state government constructed hundreds of cyclone shelters along the coast to provide safe refuge during storms, which were stocked with essentials like food and water. - Local stakeholders, NGOs, and civil society organizations collaborated with the government to conduct training programs on disaster preparedness including educating communities about evacuation routes and safety measures The resilience-building activities undertaken after Cyclone Fani reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate response efforts with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. The lessons learned from this cyclone underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in coastal regions like Odisha. #### Flood-Prone Areas Over 40 million hectares (about 12% of India’s land) is [prone to floods and river erosion](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf). The monsoon season often brings heavy rainfall leading to river overflow and flash floods, particularly in states like Assam and Bihar. ##### Assam Floods (2023) Assam, a state in northeastern India, is characterized by its fertile Brahmaputra Valley, which supports a rich agricultural sector. The state’s agriculture is primarily based on rice, tea, and jute, and it benefits from the regular monsoon rains that sustain its crops. The geographical features of Assam, including its river basins and low-lying areas, contribute significantly to its susceptibility to flooding. In 2023, Assam experienced devastating floods that [impacted](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/india-whats-really-behind-assams-worsening-floods) over 2.5 million people. In response to the challenges posed by flooding, particularly following the severe floods in 2023, several resilience-building activities have been undertaken in Assam: - The Assam government allocated Rs 1200 crs in 2023-24 for the [construction and maintenance](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=Infrastructure%20Development%3A%20The%20Assam%20government%20has%20allocated%20Rs%201%2C200%20crore%20for%20the%20construction%20and%20maintenance%20of%20flood%20control%20infrastructure%2C%20including%20embankments%20and%20flood%20barriers%2C%20for%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20period.) of flood control infrastructure, including embarkments and drainage systems and investment aimed to enhance the state's capacity to manage floodwaters effectively and reduce the risk of future inundations. - The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) invested ₹25 crores in developing advanced flood forecasting and early warning systems. These systems provide alerts up to three days in advance, allowing communities to prepare for impending floods and evacuate if necessary. - The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) [covers](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=The%20Pradhan%20Mantri%20Fasal%20Bima%20Yojana%20(PMFBY)%20covers%20around%2056%25%20of%20the%20farmers%20in%20Assam%20as%20of%202023.%20This%20scheme%20provides%20insurance%20coverage%20against%20crop%20losses%20due%20to%20natural%20calamities.) around 56% of farmers in Assam as of 2023, providing insurance against crop losses due to natural calamities. This scheme is crucial for protecting farmers' livelihoods and ensuring financial support during disasters. - A Community-Based Disaster Management project was launched in 2023, aimed at building local capacity for flood management in 100 selected gram panchayats focusing on on empowering communities with knowledge and resources to respond effectively to floods. In 2023, Assam introduced a ' [green budget](https://www.open-contracting.org/2023/09/28/improving-climate-resilience-in-flood-prone-assam-india/)' committing approximately $2 billion towards climate change action and disaster risk reduction, aiming to enhance long-term resilience against climate-related disasters through sustainable development practices. The resilience-building activities implemented in Assam following recent floods reflect a proactive approach to disaster risk reduction. By investing in infrastructure, enhancing early warning systems, promoting community engagement, and introducing innovative financial mechanisms like insurance schemes and green budgets, Assam is working towards building a more resilient agricultural sector capable of withstanding the impacts of flooding. #### Drought and Water Scarcity Drought and water scarcity are significant challenges in India, with [about](https://nidm.gov.in/pdf/trgReports/2021/July/Report_29July2021sk.pdf) 68% of the country's cultivable area vulnerable to these conditions. ##### Rajasthan Drought and Water Scarcity Rajasthan, the largest state in India, faces significant challenges related to water scarcity and drought leading to crop failures and economic distress among farmers. The state has [limited water resources](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/ar/261801490687132806/pdf/113703-WP-Water-Assessment-and-Potential-for-Private-Sector-Interventions-PUBLIC.pdf), with only 1.16% of India's total water supply, making it particularly susceptible to prolonged drought conditions. It's among the most [vulnerable to droughts](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/29/surajpura-rajasthan-india-drought-villagers-farmers-climate#:~:text=ajasthan%2C%20India%E2%80%99s%20largest%20state%2C%20is%20among%20the%20most%20vulnerable%20to%20droughts%2C%20with%2098%25%20of%20its%20250%20village%20blocks%20in%20sectors%20marked%20as%20%E2%80%9Cdark%20zones%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20areas%20with%20dangerously%20low%20groundwater%20levels%20%E2%80%93%20and%20almost%207%25%20of%20the%20land%20uncultivable), with 98% of its 250 village blocks in sectors marked as “dark zones” – areas with dangerously low groundwater levels – and almost 7% of the land uncultivable. In response to the recurring drought conditions, several resilience-building activities have been implemented in Rajasthan: - Rainwater harvesting and water conservation techniques were introduced to mitigate the effects of droughts and were prioritized via traditional techniques such as Anictus, Bairis, and tanks. In 2023, after an [unusually high rainfall](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/climate-opportunity-how-did-rajasthan-harvest-rainwater-after-the-early-monsoon-of-2023--94579) of 588.9 mm (nearly 2X the normal amount) villagers utilized these methods to direct the water into ponds and storage system, providing drinking water [for upto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwXQurAJLKs) 1.5 years in some villages. - The Rajasthan Water Sector Restructuring Project, costing a total of $495 million, of which $345 million is [financed](https://www.ndb.int/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rajasthan-Water-00012.pdf) by the New Development Bank, aimed to rehabilitate the Indira Gandhi Canal System, covering over 990 km of canal systems, reclamation of more than 33,000 km of waterlogged areas, and implementation of micro-irrigation techniques. Government schemes like the [Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana](https://pmksy.gov.in/) (PMKSY) were implemented to focus on enhancing irrigation facilities, along with the introduction of a crop insurance scheme to protect farmers from losses due to drought. Despite these resilience-building efforts, Rajasthan continues to face the challenges posed by recurring droughts. The state's vulnerability is exacerbated by its arid climate, limited water resources, and high dependence on agriculture. Sustained efforts and investments in water management, and agricultural practices are crucial for mitigating the impact of droughts and ensuring food security in the region. #### Topography and Landslides India's diverse topography includes mountainous regions that are particularly vulnerable to landslides and avalanches, especially during the monsoon season. The Himalayan region, along with the Western Ghats, experiences heavy rainfall that can destabilize slopes and trigger landslides. One of the most devastating recent events occurred in Wayanad, Kerala, where a series of landslides on July 30, 2024, resulted in significant loss of life and property. ##### The Wayanad Landslides (2024) On July 30, 2024, Wayanad district in Kerala was struck by catastrophic landslides that resulted from extreme rainfall. [The region](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece) received 572 mm of rainfall within 48 hours leading up to the disaster, causing hillsides to collapse in the villages of Mundakkai and Chooralmala. This resulted in over 336 fatalities, ~397 were injured, and at least 118 missing. The debris flow altered the course of the Iruvanjipuzha River, exacerbating flooding conditions in surrounding areas. The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) [reported](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/86000-sq-metres-of-land-slipped-away-debris-travelled-8-km-along-iruvanjippuzha-river-isro-satellite-images-reveal/articleshow/112231968.cms?from=mdr) that about 86,000 square meters of land had shifted due to the landslide. In response to the Wanayd landslides, several activities were initiated: - A [rescue operation](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece#:~:text=On%20August%201%2C%20Chief%20Minister%20Pinarayi%20Vijayan%20said%20over%209%2C300%20people%20were%20staying%20in%2091%20relief%20camps%20in%20Wayanad%20district.) was mobilized involving the Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and local authorities, over 9,300 people were accommodated in relief camps across the district. - [Experts](https://india.mongabay.com/2024/08/commentary-on-the-trail-of-the-wayanad-landslide/) have called for implementing site-specific land-use policies and improving drainage management to mitigate future risks. Additionally, establishing local landslide early warning systems (LEWS) has been recommended to enhance community preparedness. The Wayanad landslides highlight the urgent need for improved land management practices and disaster preparedness in vulnerable regions of India. By implementing effective resilience-building strategies, including community engagement and infrastructure improvements, it is possible to mitigate the impacts of future landslides and protect lives and livelihoods. India's unique geographical factors significantly contribute to its vulnerability to natural disasters. The country's diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors create a complex landscape of risks, including earthquakes, coastal vulnerability, floods, droughts, landslides, and avalanches. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events due to global warming. To address these challenges, India must adopt a comprehensive approach that integrates disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into its development plans. Building resilient communities requires a multi-faceted strategy that includes strengthening early warning systems, investing in resilient infrastructure, promoting community engagement, and adopting sustainable practices.

    "full_text": "[Defense & Security](https://southasianvoices.org/sav_channels/defense-security) # India-Pakistan Cyber Skirmishes and the Challenge of Attribution Written by [Kashoon Leeza](https://southasianvoices.org/author/kashoon) October 7, 202513 min read **Editor’s Note:** _This essay is part of a series entitled “ [Cybersecurity Threats, Law, and Norms: Priorities for South Asia](https://southasianvoices.org/collection-cyber-south-asia/),” a collaboration between the Stimson Center [Cyber](https://www.stimson.org/program/cyber/) and [South Asia](https://www.stimson.org/program/south-asia/) programs._ The recent India-Pakistan crisis in May illustrated how cyber and artificial intelligence are being integrated into military combat in the subcontinent, a significant development for South Asia’s fragile strategic stability. Along with an exchange of drone strikes, conventional missile firings, and aerial dogfights, the skirmish continued in the information domain, with Pakistani media reporting that the country’s military cyber wing [disrupted](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546050/security-sources-reveal-details-of-pakistans-massive-cyberattack-against-india) a communications network in India, predominantly affecting power distribution lines and government websites. Meanwhile, hackers sympathetic to the Indian government [leaked](https://x.com/cyberforcex) compromised data from Pakistan’s taxation authority and [targeted](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/how-pro-india-hackers-defended-country-during-cross-border-cyberattacks-amid-op-sindoor/articleshow/121385229.cms) other digital infrastructure. The active incorporation of cyber operations in this recent crisis, at least as acknowledged in public media reporting on both sides, is a departure from the past. It also raises serious concerns about the challenge of attribution on the subcontinent. Assigning responsibility for cyber operations comes with political, legal, and technical challenges. For one, in hostile India-Pakistan ties, there is limited space to entertain an ill-substantiated or inaccurate attribution as it risks escalation or creates domestic pressure for retaliation. Also, public attribution may be limited by the lack of well-established national frameworks for doing so. Neither India nor Pakistan currently have an official public attribution policy, making it difficult to assess their evidentiary standards and the validity of their threat intelligence. Limited official documents on procedures for incident response and forensic capacity suggest caution with regard to the credibility of public attribution. Thirdly, in cyber geopolitics, public attribution is a strategic choice determined by decisionmakers on a case-by-case basis. Cyber operations work best when clandestine and thus attribution is often intentionally restricted to avoid exposing technical capability. This is likely why Pakistan and India have generally approached official public attribution for cyber operations with caution in the past. The deployment of cyber-attacks complementary to kinetic operations along with unverifiable and potentially premature public attribution could set a dangerous precedent for a strategic environment as hostile and fragile as South Asia. Thus, in the absence of credible attribution tools and mechanisms, Islamabad and New Delhi would have to firmly resolve to adhere to responsible state behavior in cyberspace by doing the following: 1) establishing a cyber hotline to ensure communication channels are open, 2) supporting the applicability of international law to cyberspace, and 3) committing to non-proliferation of intrusive cyber technologies to non-state Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups to conduct cyber operations on their behalf. [\\[1\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn1) More broadly for each, institutionalizing their attribution process would ensure transparency and reassurance. **India and Pakistan’s Cyber Doctrines** Even apart from its prominent role in the recent India-Pakistan crisis, cybersecurity has found a significant place in both countries’ national security postures in recent years. In 2019, then Indian Minister of State for Defence [confirmed](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-approves-setting-up-of-defence-cyber-agency/articleshow/72264836.cms) the development of a defense cyber agency to handle cyber threats in a military context as well as budgetary allocations for cyber operations. In 2021, India’s former National Security Advisor acknowledged New Delhi’s capability to conduct “ [cyber sabotage and cyber warfare _._](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/M.-K.-Narayanan-on-India-Pakistan-diplomacy-and-terrorism/article55940567.ece)” And in 2024, the Indian Ministry of Defence [announced](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-formulate-new-doctrine-for-cyberspace-operations/articleshow/111094158.cms) a joint doctrine for cyberspace operations, shifting away from the country’s previous policy of strategic ambiguity on the use of cyber in the warfare domain, and integrating both [defensive and offensive capabilities](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2153626). [\\[2\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn2) While Pakistan does not have a pronounced cyber doctrine, Islamabad’s national security posture reflects the necessity of integrating cyber capabilities with military operations. Inaugurating the Army’s Cyber Division in 2018, the then Chief of Army Staff articulated that “ [firepower and cyber have emerged as the mainstay of future war.”](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369646/firepower-cyber-have-emerged-as-mainstay-of-future-war-coas) Pakistan has also invested in cyber capacity, as the [2021 National Cybersecurity Policy](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) reiterates, to protect national critical infrastructure as well as government information systems. These policy documents underline that India and Pakistan recognize the importance of investing in cyber capability to uphold their national interests. The next section explores how each state potentially uses these capabilities for strategic gain. **Cyber Capability and Operations** Countries are increasingly employing state capabilities to conduct cyber operations to achieve strategic objectives such as intelligence gathering; Pakistan and India are no different. Over the past few years, each state is alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage. This is done either through state capability or threat actors backed by the state. Publicly available information suggests that [APT 36](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/apt-36)—also known as [Transparent Tribe](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/transparent-tribe-apt36-pakistan-aligned-threat-actor-expands-interest-in-indian-education-sector/) and [SideCopy](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/operation_c-major)—is a Pakistan-linked APT group, alleged to have conducted cyber [espionage](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) particularly in India and Afghanistan. Likewise, APT groups such as [Sidewinder](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0121/#%3A~%3Atext%3DSidewinder%20is%20a%20suspected%20Indian%2CChina%2C%20Nepal%2C%20and%20Afghanistan) and [Patchwork](https://medium.com/@Ab_Hussain/indian-apts-target-middle-east-1e4a11b3ce95) are thought to be Indian state-backed threat actors, conducting cyber operations in Pakistan and elsewhere. > “Over the past few years, \\[India and Pakistan are\\] alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage.” While there is limited information publicly available regarding the cyber operations conducted by each side, some sources do point to state acquiescence or support. A report by a Canadian firm [revealed](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/media/27613/ocr) that in 2021, the Indian government had allegedly conducted [cyber surveillance](https://www.dawn.com/news/1636767) on Pakistan’s [political leaders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/) using the Israeli [Pegasus software](https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-pegasus-spyware/). India-based hacking groups reportedly continued to [target](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) Pakistani government entities in the following years aiming to infiltrate systems and access computer controls. Similarly, media reports claimed that Pakistan-based hackers had [deployed](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) malware against Indian government and defense sectors, attempting to gain access to sensitive information. In 2019, the cyber-attack on India’s nuclear facility, the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, was thought by some [analysts](https://www.orfonline.org/research/decoding-motives-behind-the-kudankulam-intrusion-58083) to have been perpetrated by Pakistan, though there was no public attribution. The technical attribution by cybersecurity firms [pointed](https://www.vifindia.org/sites/default/files/cyber-attack-on-kudankulam-nuclear-power-plant.pdf) to a North Korean state-sponsored entity, the Lazarus Group. This complex picture of the potential use of proxies points to the challenge of attribution in an India-Pakistan context. **The Attribution Challenge** Attribution in cyberspace is the process of identifying and assigning responsibility to threat actors behind the cyber operation or malicious activity. However, attribution is rarely straightforward because, unlike physical crimes, cyber actors can hide behind the anonymity of the internet or impersonate other computers. Threat actors can also remain in the system undetected, silently stealing information through stolen passwords or impersonation. In terms of technical challenges, the sophistication of the operation depending on capability could also make it difficult to trace the crime back to an actor. For instance, during the India-Pakistan crisis in May, the Indian cyber agency, Maharashtra Cyber, reported a significant surge in cyber-attacks [originating](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-sindoor-and-india-pakistans-escalated-rivalry-cyberspace#:~:text=noted%20a%20surge%20in%20DDoS,in%20these%20cyberattacks%20as%20it) from Pakistan as well as countries like Indonesia, Morocco, and Bangladesh. Threat actors using the location of a third country is often a deliberate and popular tactic to confuse the perpetrator’s identity and origin, as an IP address is usually the first source of identification. A popular global example is the 2018 [Olympic Destroyer cyberattack in South Korea](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/olympic-destroyer/21494/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20the,uproar%20was%20no%20laughing%20matter.), when the [Russian threat actors](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/) used sophisticated tactics to conceal their identity, enabling the blame to be deflected to North Korea and China. Thus, even if one actor might visibly be responsible, there might be someone else behind the keyboard. Moreover, technical attribution requires advanced threat intelligence capability, without which attribution could be erroneous and enable “false flag” categorization. For example, recently, Russian state-linked cyber group Turla allegedly attempted to access data exfiltrated from Indian military networks. Threat intelligence by Microsoft and Lumen’s BlackLotus Labs indicate that Turla [compromised a network](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) of Pakistan-based group SideCopy to spy on the Indian network. This created a false impression, shifting the blame towards Pakistan. This reiterates that the use of sophisticated techniques in an operation and the lack of advanced capability for forensic analysis can potentially obscure a threat actor’s identity, making attribution a challenge. Even advanced nations struggle with having requisite forensic capacity, so relatively newer cyber entrants like India and Pakistan will have to invest more efforts in this space. The key legal challenge India and Pakistan face regarding attribution is the lack of a transparent, and credible attribution framework. Unlike some countries, India and Pakistan do not have a formal attribution policy, making it difficult for independent analysts to assess the validity of their institutional processes. In practice, the process involves a loose [network of agencies](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/mapping-indias-cybersecurity-administration-in-2025?lang=en) coordinating technical and intelligence findings, raising concerns about the lack of consistent and verifiable evidentiary standards. It was in highlighting some of these challenges that Pakistan’s 2023 [position](https://docs-library.unoda.org/Open-Ended_Working_Group_on_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_-_(2021)/UNODA.pdf) on applicability of international law in cyberspace emphasized cross-border coordination and cooperation globally to ensure substantiated attribution. A lack of consistent evidentiary standards complicates attribution and can leave such efforts open to criticism as being politically motivated, making it critical for India and Pakistan to address this lacuna. This leads to the political challenge of attribution. The United States and [Five Eyes](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/fv-cntry-mnstrl-en.aspx) allies often attribute cyber-attacks when they need to reinforce international pressure on political adversaries or justify policy shifts. New Delhi and Islamabad have approached attribution rather cautiously. Though there are multiple reasons for this, the obvious one is to avoid jumping the gun and pointing to an adversary, which may create a particularly dangerous scenario of escalation. **Redefining Crises and Stability in South Asia** Attribution uncertainty creates costs for stability in South Asia and risks escalation in a future India- Pakistan crisis. Both countries share a hostile past and a tense strategic environment, leaving limited space for misunderstanding and miscalculation. A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing, tarnishing trust on both sides and instilling doubt. Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression. Pakistan’s 2021 Cyber Security Policy explicitly mentions that a cyberattack on critical infrastructure would be regarded as an [act of aggression](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) and be met with an appropriate response. > “A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing \\[…\\] Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression.” Another predicament is the question of proportionate response to an offensive cyber intrusion conducted by a state or state-linked threat actors without clear attribution. This is a conundrum faced by states globally, not just India and Pakistan. Determining what is a proportionate response in cyberspace currently lies at the discretion of the state. Some countries have included the principle of proportionality in formal statements unpacking how they interpret international law as applying to their conduct in cyberspace. According to its 2023 statement, while Pakistan acknowledges proportionality as applying in the context of conflict and international humanitarian law, it does not otherwise present views on response. India has not yet published a national statement. Such norms and behavior are either unaddressed or awaiting legal applicability in international frameworks. For the complicated security environment of South Asia, integration of cyber capability without legal clarity is thus worrisome. In times of active conflict, cyber operations, including information and influence operations, can create a [fog of war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQvsb4ouuI0) for decisionmakers and undermine the process of crisis management. Persistent cyber intrusions could also further compromise trust and impact and possibly backtrack the confidence-building measures (CBMs) already in place between India and Pakistan. Given that nuclear CBMs between India and Pakistan are already tenuous, a potential cyber-attack or even a data breach could be misperceived as altering the balance of power. **Policy Recommendations** To ensure that cyber does not introduce yet another element of uncertainty and that the precarious balance of power is maintained on the subcontinent, policymakers in India and Pakistan should: **_Establish a cyber hotline:_** Cyber operations can perpetuate misperception and misunderstanding, especially with attribution challenges. Therefore, rapid communication during a cyber crisis is critical. Both countries could exchange doctrines, ensure technical cooperation, and maintain a directory in case of crisis. Cyber CBMs, including hotlines and dedicated focal points for exchange, can also potentially enhance a sense of predictability. **_Support the applicability of international law to cyberspace:_** While there is consensus across the board that international law applies to cyberspace, states are still discussing how core legal principles and existing commitments, such as the non-use of force, proportionality, sovereignty, and due diligence, apply to cyberspace. Islamabad and New Delhi are advised to actively adhere to international and bilateral negotiations, such as the UN’s recently launched Global Mechanism on ICTs, successor to the Open-ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies. Pakistan published its national position paper in 2023 outlining the applicability of international law. India could follow suit, to maintain accountability and transparency. **_Commit to restraining proliferation of offensive intrusion capabilities:_** To dodge attribution and accountability, states often employ non-state APT groups to influence cyber operations. This results in proliferation of sophisticated intrusive cyber technologies and capabilities to non-state threat actors, not bound by rules and norms of state responsibility. Cyber operations through non-state APT actors help maintain plausible deniability. India and Pakistan should refrain from transferring capabilities to non-state APT groups to ensure responsible state behavior and maintain stability. **_Institutionalize attribution:_** To ensure responsible state behavior, both India and Pakistan should consider improving their attribution process. Institutionalizing the process and detailing their evidentiary standards to substantiate the findings will build confidence in their intelligence and threat assessments. Publishing a national attribution policy would explain the objectives behind disclosing a breach or attack, beyond merely aiming for political scoring. Further, both states could also benefit from investing in legal and technical capacity-building for attribution, including in collaboration with private entities and multilateral partnerships. As their decades-long hostilities spill over into cyberspace, there is likely a higher probability of cyber operations increasing in an India-Pakistan context. Realizing the serious implications of cyber threats to strategic stability, Pakistan and India are advised to seriously engage in the measures above that would reduce misperception, increase accountability and transparency, and indicate their commitments to the norms and practices of international law and responsible state behavior during conflict and peace time. _Views expressed are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the positions of South Asian Voices, the Stimson Center, or our supporters._ Also Read: [Cyber Quicksand?

Defensive capabilities, as the name suggests, are used for building resilience. The aim is to build capacity to protect and respond, minimizing risks and mitigating cyber threats. Offensive capabilities are used to deny, disrupt, and degrade or destroy the adversary’s systems or networks for military or strategic purposes. However, the nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to neatly distinguish between offensive and defensive actions; some activities, like those carried out by security researchers for the purpose of testing for vulnerabilities, could be viewed as an offensive action. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Image 1: [blickpixel via Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/circuit-board-computer-chip-564814/) Image 2: [Great Norwegian Encyclopedia](https://snl.no/Kjernekraft_i_India) Posted in: [Crisis](https://southasianvoices.org/category/crisis/), [Cybersecurity](https://southasianvoices.org/category/cybersecurity/), [Escalation Control](https://southasianvoices.org/category/escalation-control/), [India](https://southasianvoices.org/category/india/), [India-Pakistan Relations](https://southasianvoices.org/category/india-pakistan-relations/), [Pakistan](https://southasianvoices.org/category/pakistan/), [Technology](https://southasianvoices.org/category/technology/) Share this: ## Subscribe to our newsletter Stay informed about the subcontinent.

Today's spy doesn't wear a trench coat or sneak across borders — they slip into servers. A few lines of malicious code, a cleverly worded phishing email, and one careless click are enough to open a backdoor into power grids, defence networks, or corporate vaults. There's no gunfire, no alarm — just a silent invasion across cyberspace.Modern espionage no longer focuses on state secrets alone. It can paralyse ports, jam telecoms, empty bank accounts, and hold critical infrastructure hostage, all from thousands of miles away. Many of these attacks aren't random pranks but well-coordinated operations by advanced persistent threats (APTs) — hacker groups often backed by nation-states who monitor systems for months and even years — or by ‘Spider gangs', the global cybercrime cartels who chase profit, not politics.In Feb 2025, a hacker collective calling itself ‘Keymous+' targeted Gujarat's civic systems, according to FalconFeeds.io, a threat actor repository. The group overwhelmed the websites of Ahmedabad and Surat municipal corporations with fake web traffic in a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that crashed the portals for hours. Analysts found that Keymous+ boasted of 700 global attacks in 2025, 27.6% of which were govt entities while the rest ranged from finance and telecom to education. **You Can Also Check: [Ahmedabad AQI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-aqi-level-air-quality-index-today/3252) \\| [Weather in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-weather-forecast-today/380001) \\| [Gold Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/gold-rates-today/gold-price-in-ahemadabad) \\| [Silver Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/silver-rates-today/silver-price-in-ahemadabad)** But others aimed far deeper. In 2020, RedEcho, a group suspected to be backed by a nation-state, infiltrated India's power grid. They did not cause blackouts, but mapped out critical systems like the regional and state load despatch centres (RLDCs and SLDCs) — the nerve centres managing electricity supply — in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and several northern states. Cybersecurity experts at Recorded Future's Insikt group believe the hackers were creating digital \"backdoors\" — hidden entry points — \"to cause potential blackouts in the future\".Then came, TAG-38, another elite adversary sponsored by an enemy nation. Between Sep 2021 and March 2022, \"they targeted at least seven SLDCs in northern and western India, including areas near sensitive border zones\", states the Inskit group report. They cleverly hid their tracks by using hacked DVRs and IP cameras in Taiwan and South Korea to control their attacks remotely. These groups use advanced tools like ShadowPad (a modular malware that can be customised for different attacks) and remote access trojan (RAT) software that lets hackers control a computer from afar. They often get in through spear phishing — tricking someone into clicking a fake email link — or by exploiting weak spots in websites.India also faces threats from APT36 known as ‘Transparent Tribe', another group backed by an enemy nation and active since 2013. In March and April 2025, they disguised malware as updates on the ‘Pahalgam terror attack' to trick officials into opening infected files. They even created fake ministry of defence websites and used a sneaky trick called ClickFix, where malicious code is copied from a user's clipboard without them knowing.Meanwhile, SideCopy, another group, used fake social media profiles and phishing emails to target India's defence personnel. And APT41, also backed by an enemy nation, has been spying on India's healthcare and tech sectors, while also [hacking](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hacking) for money, even manipulating virtual currencies in online games.To combat such threats, Gujarat's science and technology department issued a circular this year, urging all govt employees to strengthen cyber hygiene. \"Do not share official photos or documents online, and never link work emails to personal apps,\" warned principal secretary Mona Kandhar. Officials were reminded that one careless click can compromise an entire department.The war is invisible, but it is already here. Every click, download, or forwarded file could be the entry point for a breach waiting to happen.

Course](https://www.pw.live/batches/upsc?utm_source=seo+upsc+batch&utm_medium=seo+upsc&utm_campaign=seo&utm_id=upsc) - **Key Causes of Economic Losses** - **Floods as a Major Cause of Losses**: - Floods account for approximately **63% of annual economic losses in India.** - **Major flood events include:** - The **Mumbai floods** of 2005, which caused economic losses of **$5.3 billion (in 2024 prices).** - The **Uttarakhand floods in 2013**, Jammu and Kashmir floods in 2014, Kerala floods in 2018, and northern India floods in 2023. - The **Chennai floods of 2015**, which caused economic losses of $6.6 billion (in 2024 prices). - **Tropical Cyclones (TC) and Tsunamis** - **Tropical Cyclones**: - **Cyclone Biparjoy (2023)**: Made landfall in Gujarat, shutting down ports (e.g., Mundra, Kandla) and causing widespread damage in Maharashtra and Rajasthan. - **Cyclone Michaung (2023)**: Resulted in extreme rainfall and significant losses in Chennai. - **Tsunamis**: Coastal regions, especially along the eastern coast, are prone to tsunamis. - The **2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami** caused widespread destruction in Tamil Nadu and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. - **Vulnerability**: India’s **5,700 km coastline** is highly exposed to cyclones and tsunamis, impacting urban centers, ports, and industries​​. - **Earthquake Vulnerability:** 58.6% of India’s landmass is prone to moderate to high-intensity earthquakes. - **New Delhi and Ahmedabad** are particularly exposed to earthquake risks. - Potential earthquake **epicentres** include the Himalayas, which could impact Delhi, and regions near urban centres like Mumbai or Delhi. - An earthquake similar to the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** could cause much greater losses today due to increased asset concentration. ## **About Natural Catastrophes** - A natural catastrophe is an **unexpected event, caused by nature**, such as an earthquake or flood, in which there is a lot of suffering, damage, or death. ### **Impacts of Natural Catastrophes** - #### **Economic Impacts** - **Direct losses:** Direct losses include damage to infrastructure, industries, homes, and agricultural lands. For instance, **₹1 lakh crore (USD 12 billion)** in economic loss was recorded in 2023 due to floods and cyclones. - **Indirect losses:** Indirect losses result from the disruption of **industrial and economic activities**, such as the shutdown of ports and supply chains during Cyclone Biparjoy in Gujarat, and a decline in agricultural productivity due to droughts and floods. - **Insurance gap:** Over **90% of natural disaster-related losses in India remain uninsured**, increasing financial strain on households and businesses. - #### **Humanitarian Impacts** - **Loss of Lives and Livelihoods:** Natural catastrophes lead to significant loss of lives and livelihoods. For example, the **2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami** and Northern India floods (2023) caused high casualties and displacement of people. - **Health and Vulnerable Groups**: These disasters also increase the risk of **waterborne diseases** and disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, including economically weaker sections, women, children, and differently-abled individuals.

    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#content) _The second report in ACLED’s_ [_**India Special Election Series**_](https://acled-production.sbx.so/series/india-2024-special-election-series) _covering the parliamentary elections held from 19 April to 1 June focuses on the increased religious polarization — particularly between the majority Hindu population and large Muslim community, among others — as a driver for political violence across India._ On 22 January 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Ram temple in Ayodhya at the site where the Babri mosque once stood, marking the unofficial start of the general elections campaign by his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).[1](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote1)The construction of the temple, which had served as a rallying cry for Hindu nationalists since the mosque’s demolition by a Hindu mob, stirred up sentiments of Hindu pride across the country, with the BJP leading the celebrations.[2](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote2)On the other hand, the principal opposition party, the Indian National Congress (INC), boycotted the ceremony, accusing the BJP of politicizing religion.[3](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote3)The fanfare surrounding the inauguration also overlooked the temple’s deadly origins, prompting concern over the turn toward majoritarianism in Indian society.[4](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote4) The Babri mosque, constructed under the reign of the Mughal emperor Babar, was believed to have stood upon the birthplace of the Hindu Lord Ram, making it a point of contention between India’s Hindu and Muslim communities for nearly two centuries.[5](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote5)Following nationwide mobilization by senior BJP leaders to reclaim the Ram Janmabhoomi (birthplace), a Hindu mob demolished the Babri Masjid on 6 December 1992.[6](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote6)In the years since, the Ram Mandir (temple) remained a focal point of the Hindu nationalist movement, with the BJP at its forefront. A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote7) Close footnote The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote8)The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote9)Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote10)The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote11)The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. Close footnote ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote12)The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote13)By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote14)Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote15) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote16)Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote17)In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote18) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote19)In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote20)In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote21)Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. Close footnote Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows. [22](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote22)Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote23)Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote24) Close footnote A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote25)Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote26)A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote27)ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively. This is despite widespread condemnation from independent human rights bodies and refrains from the judiciary.[28](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote28)Following bulldozer action in the aftermath of the 2023 Nuh riots, the Punjab and Haryana High Court questioned whether the targeted demolitions of Muslim houses amounted to “an exercise of ethnic cleansing … by the State.”[29](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote29) Close footnote ## **Toward a Hindu** _**rashtra**_ **?** Religious polarization is likely to get worse in the run-up to the elections, with the BJP well-positioned to benefit electorally from the consolidation of a Hindu voting bloc.[30](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote30)At a campaign event during the ongoing elections, Modi himself stirred up communal tensions by referring to Muslims as “infiltrators” and raising alarms that the opposition planned to redistribute the country’s wealth to Muslims, a claim that was widely dismissed as misleading.[31](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote31)A recent report by the Washington, DC-based India Hate Lab found that hate speech, mainly directed against Muslims, peaked during campaigning for Indian state elections in 2023; the BJP won three of the five states that went to polls.[32](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote32)Anti-Muslim sentiment in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots, where Hindu mobs reportedly killed hundreds of Muslims, also helped Modi, then the chief minister of Gujarat, remain in power for over a decade before propelling his rise to the national level.[33](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote33)Besides the ‘Hindi heartland’ states of North and Central-West India, which have historically seen high levels of communal violence, religious polarization can also be expected to drive an increase in violence in states such as Kerala and West Bengal, as the BJP seeks to capitalize on Hindu pride to expand its political footprint.[34](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote34)The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote35)The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. Close footnote A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote36)Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote37)For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote38) Close footnote _**Visuals in this report were produced by Ana Marco.**_ ## Footnotes 01.

The two main actors that constitute the best hope for global growth are obviously India and China. Of the two, India is in many ways the better bet. The country’s ‘bottom-up’ economic model (enabling it to better withstand systemic shocks), its demographic composition and its democratic system provide it with a future outlook that is brighter than China’s. Also, it is impressive that, despite endemic corruption, poor infrastructure, and a currently weak and directionless Congress Party-dominated government, India’s economy maintains a growth rate of 6%. Moving into an era of multipolarity, the importance of enhancing ties with a rising power like India is of great strategic importance for the West. At the same time, though, India is facing internal security pressures, albeit largely unknown to many investors and policy makers. Large swaths of Indian territory are plagued by conflict between the state and the long-running Maoist insurgency group known as the Naxalites. If not dealt with effectively, the Naxalites might prove to be too much for New Delhi and turn out to be India’s Achilles heel imperiling its phenomenal global rise. The current manifestation of Maoist-inspired violence in India can be traced back to the period immediately following the country’s independence in 1948. The term Naxal or Naxalite is derived from the Indian village of Naxalbari (West Bengal) where the movement has its roots. The stated goal of the Naxalites was, and remains to this day, to free the poor from the clutches of the landlords, to implement land reforms and destroy the oppressive feudal order in India. A central part their strategy to achieve this goal has been a guerrilla war against government forces in the underdeveloped rural and tribal regions of India. Although the nature of the movement makes it difficult to estimate the group’s size, recent estimates by The Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence service, have placed the numerical strength of the Naxalites at some 20,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. These numbers would suggest that the Naxalites are almost twice as big as the FARC movement in Columbia, which numbered around 11,000 operatives in 2009. The Naxalites’ organizational structure includes an elaborate hierarchy with a Central Committee at the top, followed by Regional Bureaus, Zonal or State Committees, and District or Division Committees. Following a period of internal strife and fractional splits, in 2004 the a merger occurred to create an umbrella organizational structure for the Naxalite insurgency. This reunification was followed by an upswing in the level of violence. Like all successful or enduring insurgent groups, the Naxalites follow a two-tiered strategy, using violence against their opponents as well as engaging in socio-economic initiatives to win the support of the population. With regard to the latter, it is important to note that the Naxalite insurgency puts much effort into addressing the grievances of the marginalised poor, who are disappointed in – or even hostile towards – the Indian government. For instance, Naxalite fighters have campaigned for women’s rights, have tried to improve the housing situation of those in need, have organised railway strikes, and have run irrigation projects to help farmers increase their harvests. The violent actions that make up the other second pillar of he Naxalite strategy are mostly aimed against the police, Indian government officials and transnational corporations. These attacks are intended to shield the population from capitalist influence. The Naxalites are quite successful in this regard, as the group has managed to take control of certain regions, especially in the Red Corridor, where state power has been eroded or has collapsed altogether. Several factors account for the Naxalites’ ability to pull off tours de force of this kind. First, the manpower that the Indian insurgents brings to bear, gives them the organisational clout needed to wage a large-scale campaign. Second, although the Naxalites are geographically dispersed and not centrally led, the group shows a remarkable commitment to the overall strategy. Although the group’s operatives occasionally lash out at the local population, Naxalite actions generally fit the ambition to create Naxalite-controlled areas to encircle the cities and eventually take over the country. The third explanation of the insurgency’s sustainability is the fact that many Naxalite operatives are active in their native areas. From this, they derive knowledge of the terrain, crucial in irregular warfare, as well as familiarity with the local population and its plight, which makes it unlikely that they will be perceived as interlopers. Another factor that makes it unlikely that the Naxalite insurgency will soon be a thing of the past is the inadequacy of the Indian government’s response. While it is clear that discrimination and poverty of the rural population provide the Naxalites with a support base and a pool of potential recruits, the government’s measures to alleviate the living conditions of the rural poor are generally half-hearted and poorly implemented. Rather, the government tries to quell the insurgency by taking a hard approach with a central role for law enforcement agencies. Thus far however, this hard line has not yielded the desired results. The number of police forces deployed against the Naxalites was recently increased to 76,000, but the insurgency is still alive and kicking. And even regardless of the effectiveness of the government line, it remains to be seen whether it is sustainable. India is one of the most underpoliced countries in the world, and there is little chance that the government will deploy the army, reluctant as it is to start a long and messy campaign and to take forces away from Jammu and Kashmir. It appears that the Naxalites are here to stay. All too often, analyses of India are based on the assumption that its rise is inevitable and effortless. For a long time, the western view was that the rest of the world held little allure to the west, but now, the received wisdom on India at business and international relations conferences is an overcompensation of earlier neglect and underestimation. This overly sunny view is as misguided as the prior arrogance. What is needed is a sober analysis of India’s economy and internal security situation. The goal of this article has certainly not been to denigrate the future potential of India or to engage in fear mongering. Rather, we have tried to draw attention to an important actor on the Indian scene that until now has received only minimal international attention. Adding this dimension to current thinking about India will allow investors and policy makers to make informed decisions on when, how and where to invest their money in India. If India is serious about defeating the Naxalites, they will need to deal with the root causes of the group’s appeal in the Red Corridor, which will require addressing poverty, corruption and tribal inclusion issues. Only by doing so can India retain the domestic stability that is a prerequisite for its continued phenomenal rise. ### About The Author ## Article Discussion: ![Small Wars Journal by Arizona State University](https://smallwarsjournal.com/wp-content/themes/swj/images/logo_icon.svg) ### Become a Member To Engage!

India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

According to **Swiss Re’s 2023 analysis, India suffered economic losses amounting to $12 billion (over ₹1 lakh crore) in 2023**, surpassing the 10-year average of $8 billion (2013-2022). Key disasters such as Cyclones Biparjoy and Michaung, as well as devastating floods, underscore the need for robust disaster management strategies. With floods alone accounting for 63% of total annual economic losses, there is a pressing need for improved preparedness, response mechanisms, and long-term mitigation measures. ###### **Admission Open for UPSC Prelims Revision Batch Starts from 13th January 2025 [: https://bit.ly/4jciwCi](http://%20https//bit.ly/4jciwCi)** * * * #### **Table of Contents** 1. **Introduction to Natural Disasters in India** 2. **Major Disasters and Their Impacts (2023)** 3. **Industrial and Urban Vulnerability** 4. **Disaster Management in India** 5. **Challenges in Disaster Management** 6. **Global Best Practices in Disaster Management** 7. **Steps Taken for Disaster Management in India** 8. **Way Forward** 9. **Conclusion** * * * ##### **Introduction to Natural Disasters in India** India’s geographical diversity makes it prone to a range of natural disasters, including cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and droughts. According to the **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), about 58.6% of India’s landmass is vulnerable to earthquakes, 12% to floods, and 8% to cyclones**. This vulnerability, coupled with unplanned urbanization, deforestation, and climate change, exacerbates the scale and impact of disasters. The economic implications are equally significant, with losses mounting annually due to inadequate preparedness and mitigation measures. ###### **Daily Current Affairs available here: [https://bit.ly/3C4SAYw](https://bit.ly/3C4SAYw)** India’s history of catastrophic events, such as the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and the 2013 Uttarakhand floods, highlights the urgent need for a resilient disaster management framework.

Due to its geographical location, seismic risk zone and intertropical convergence point, the Indian subcontinent also faces recurring atmospheric phenomena: heavy monsoon rains, floods, episodes of high heat, drought, etc. In addition, the high population density in risk areas further aggravates the situation. The number of human casualties continues to rise, from 1 674 deaths in 2015 to 2 045 in 2019. According to the report of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the total number of people who died between 2 000 and 2 019 is 79 732. During the same period, India had reported 321 catastrophic events. It is the third country in the world in terms of the number of [natural disasters](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/natural-disasters-in-2021), behind China and the United States. According to the same report, India has suffered nearly 80 billion USD in economic losses in 20 years. ## Breakdown of natural disasters in India per type of event and nature of losses | Natural disasters | Material loss | Human loss | | --- | --- | --- | | **Floods** | 52% | 63% | 32% | | **Hurricanes** | 30% | 19% | 32% | | **Landslides** | 10% | - | 2% | | **Earthquakes** | 5% | 10% | 33% | | **Droughts** | 3% | 5% | 1% | | Total | 100% | 100% | 100% | **Source :** World Bank Some of the most frequent disasters include : **Floods** After China, India is the second country hardest hit by floods with no less than 17 of such events annually, affecting 345 million Indians. This scourge has caused a significant number of casualties and major economic damage to infrastructure, property, livelihoods and crops. Heavy monsoon rains in the eastern part of the country often cause the Brahmaputra River to overflow, with disastrous consequences. According to the 2019 Global Climate Risk Index report, floods account for 52% of the total calamities affecting India, claiming 63% of the material damage and 32% of the human losses reported as natural disasters. On an annual average, 7.500.000 hectares are flooded, and 1.600 lives are lost. **Earthquakes** The probability of an earthquake is high in India, with nearly 60% of the territory being classified as a moderate to severe seismic risk zone. According to seismologists, the Himalayas, one of the regions most exposed to earthquakes, should one day suffer a mega-shock caused by the pressure accumulated in the subsoil of the Himalayan arc. The last earthquake to date occurred in 2015. With a magnitude of 7.8, the earthquake killed 9 000 people and injured more than 20 000 others. More than 600 000 homes were also destroyed by the tremor. **Cyclones** Located in the intertropical convergence zone, the Indian subcontinent is one of the regions most affected by cyclones. Its coastline stretching over more than 8 000 kilometers accounts for nearly 10% of the world's tropical cyclones, the majority of which emerge over the Bay of Bengal and strike the east coast of India. On average, six to eight depressions form each year, two or three of which turn into tropical cyclones. A major cyclone (category 3 or more) develops every two years. In May 2020, [Cyclone Amphan](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/cyclone-amphan-15-billion-usd-of-economic-losses-in-south-asia), devastated India and Bangladesh, killing 84 people and devastating the coastal areas of both countries. It was the most powerful cyclone to hit the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 cyclone that killed 10 000 people in Odisha State (northeast India). **Heat waves and droughts** Extreme temperatures and resulting weather conditions significantly affect the health of residents and the agricultural sector. With global warming, these episodes of intense heat, more than 50 degrees, are becoming increasingly frequent. According to Indian authorities, in the last four years the country has reported no less than 4 620 deaths caused by heat waves which generally occur between March and June. The last event of this kind occurred in June 2019, claiming the lives of 50 people in 24 hours. Over the past 20 years, India has also sustained the two most severe droughts in the world. They took place in 2002 and 2015 and affected 300 and 330 million Indians, respectively. Despite the affordability of coverage and the intensity and frequency of natural events, the penetration rate of natural catastrophe insurance in India is almost nil, with less than 1% of the population contracting an insurance policy for this type of risk. For several years, the authorities have been planning to set up a national pool dedicated to natural disasters, a structure struggling to see the light of day. ## List of major natural disasters that have occurred over the last 20 years in India | Date | Place | Nature of the event | Economic losses | Insured losses | Number of fatalities | Number of affected persons | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | (in billion USD) | | **May 2020** | West Bengal | Hurricane Amphan | 13.5 | ND | 103 | 500 000 homeless | | **August 2018** | Kerala | Floods | 3.52 | 0.37 | 504 | 223 139 homeless | | **November 2015** | Chennai (Tamil Nadu) | Floods | 2.37 | 0.98 | 289 | -

REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead) WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department's 2023 [religious freedom report on India, opens new tab](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-report-on-international-religious-freedom/india/) noted violent attacks on minority groups, especially Muslims and Christians, including killings, assaults and vandalism of houses of worship. The report on international religious freedom released on Wednesday said that in 2023, senior U.S. officials continued to \"raise concerns about religious freedom issues\" with their Indian counterparts. Sign up [here.](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/us-religious-freedom-report-notes-violence-against-indian-minorities-2024-06-26/undefined?location=article-paragraph) Human rights experts say India has seen a rise in attacks on minorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently won a third term, and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \"In India, we see a concerning increase in anti-conversion laws, hate speech, demolitions of homes and places of worship for members of minority faith communities,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken [said, opens new tab](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-2023-international-religious-freedom-report-rollout/) when the report was released, in a rare direct rebuke of India. Criticism of India by the U.S. is usually restrained due to close economic ties and New Delhi's importance for Washington [to counter China](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-wishes-india-luck-with-structural-issues-strained-china-ties-2024-06-12/), political analysts say. The U.S. report listed dozens of incidents. Among them was a fatal shooting of a security official and three Muslims on a train near Mumbai by a suspect who was a railway security official. A probe by Indian authorities into that case is ongoing and the suspect was in jail, according to the Indian Express newspaper. The report cited examples of attacks against Muslims based on allegations that Muslim men were participating in the slaughter of cows or beef trading. The Indian embassy in Washington had no immediate comment. The Indian government denies [discriminating](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-will-talk-human-rights-rule-law-with-modi-2023-06-22/) against minorities, and says its welfare policies - like food subsidy schemes and electrification drives - [aim to benefit all Indians](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-modi-denies-stoking-divisions-win-election-files-nomination-2024-05-14/).

The State Department report also cited violence in the northeastern state of Manipur that started in May last year between minority, mostly Christian, Kuki and majority, mostly Hindu, Meitei ethnic groups. Hindu and Christian places of worship were destroyed in Manipur. Citing a local tribal leaders' forum, the report said over 250 churches were burnt down, more than 200 people were killed and over 60,000 were displaced.

These states also face heightened risks: - **Gujarat:** Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. - **Maharashtra:** Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. - **Tamil Nadu:** Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. ## **Earthquake Risks** - Urban centres like **Delhi** and **Ahmedabad** face significant earthquake hazards. - A major earthquake in the **Himalayas** or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** in Gujarat. ## **Challenges in Resilience and Insurance** - Despite the scale of economic losses, **underinsurance** remains a critical issue: - **Protection Gaps:** Over **90%** of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. - **Costliest Flood Events:** - **Mumbai floods (2005):** Losses of **$5.3 billion** (2024 prices) - **Chennai floods (2015):** Losses of **$6.6 billion** (2024 prices) ## **Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach** - Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: - **Hotspot Identification:** - Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. - Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. - **Risk Assessment:** - Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. - Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. - **Reinsurance Solutions:** - Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. - Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. ## **Conclusion** - India's rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. - The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. - By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. * * * ### **Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods?** Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. ### **Q2. When was NDMA constituted?** In December 2005, the Government of India enacted the Disaster Management Act, which envisaged the creation of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers. **Source :** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-economic-losses-natural-catastrophes-9779008/) * * * ​ ​ ​ Submit * * * ![logo](https://www.vajiramandravi.com/_next/static/media/badge_logo.5fb7c7f1.svg) © 2025 Vajiram & Ravi.

[**Inflationary Pressures**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/inflation/) **:** Energy or fuel disruptions drive commodity prices up (e.g., Colonial Pipeline case). - **National Security Impacts:** 1. **Strategic Sabotage Risk:** Adversaries may infiltrate grids or water systems to cause covert damage. 2. **Plausible Deniability in Warfare:** Cyberattacks are hard to trace, complicating retaliatory diplomacy. 3. **Civilian Harm:** Attacks on water treatment or hospitals can directly **endanger** [**public health**.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2025/03/17/public-health-education/) **World Economic Forum (WEF) Recommendations:** - [**Internal Network Security Monitoring**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/security-issues/internal-security/) **(INSM):** Adopt models like US FERC’s CIP-015-1, mandating real-time OT traffic surveillance. - **Integrated Cyber-Physical Governance:** Treat OT security as national infrastructure, not an IT subset. - **Invest in Detection Technologies:** Deploy AI-driven anomaly detection and forensic data recorders for rapid attribution. - **Public–Private Coordination:** Build sectoral cyber fusion centers to share threat intelligence across energy, transport, and health. - **Workforce Capacity-Building:** Upskill engineers in OT cybersecurity through global WEF–NATO–ITU partnerships. **Conclusion:** Critical infrastructure lies at the heart of national resilience — yet its cybersecurity lag leaves nations exposed to both economic paralysis and strategic coercion. The WEF warns that without urgent investment in OT visibility and [cross-sector coordination](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2024/09/26/q10-what-type-of-cooperation-between-the-government-ngos-and-private-sectors-would-be-most-effective-in-tackling-socio-economic-issues-of-development-10m/), the next major cyberattack could shut down cities, not just servers.

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "# CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report: A New Era of Threats Emerges ## CrowdStrike Intelligence observes a thriving Chinese-language underground ecosystem and the rise of AI-developed ransomware operations. October 20, 2025 \\| [Counter Adversary Operations](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/author.counter-adversary-operations/) \\| [Threat Hunting & Intel](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/category.counter-adversary-operations/) The eCrime threat landscape in the Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) region is quickly evolving, driven by a mix of regional and global adversaries. From Chinese-language underground marketplaces facilitating the sale of stolen data and illicit services, to a rise in AI-developed ransomware campaigns, threat actors across the region are seeking new ways to scale and accelerate their operations. The CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report provides a definitive view of these threats, based on frontline intelligence from CrowdStrike’s elite threat hunters and intelligence analysts. The report combines analysis of adversary tradecraft, underground economies, and monetization trends with observations from CrowdStrike analysts who track malicious activity. In a rapidly changing threat landscape, the CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report provides the clarity and context organizations need to anticipate attacks, strengthen their defenses, and outpace the eCrime adversaries targeting their operations. **Learn more:** Download the [CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/resources/reports/2025-apj-ecrime-landscape-report/) ## Tools and Techniques Fueling eCrime Operations Highly active Chinese-language underground marketplaces are core to eCrime operations across the APJ region, despite the Chinese government’s internet restrictions and eCrime crackdown. This ecosystem provides Chinese-speaking threat actors — many of whom have prioritized operational security in light of government control — with an anonymous place to buy and sell stolen data, phishing kits, malware, and money laundering services. The most prominent Chinese-language marketplaces, which include Chang’an, FreeCity, and Huione Guarantee, enable cybercriminals to operate anonymously through clearnet, darknet, and Telegram channels. Huione Guarantee, which built a reputation for transparency and trustworthiness among eCrime actors, facilitated an estimated $27 billion USD in transactions over its lifespan. eCrime adversaries operated with a strong focus on high-value targets. India, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore were the most affected countries; manufacturing, technology, industrials and engineering, financial services, and professional services were the most affected sectors. Between January 2024 and April 2025, 763 APJ-based victims were named on ransomware and data theft and extortion dedicated leak sites (DLSs). CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the rise of AI-developed ransomware across the region. _KillSec_ and _FunkLocker_, both ransomware-as-a-service providers, named a disproportionate number of APJ-based victims on their DLSs, comprising 35% and 32% of their total victims, respectively. Of these victims, most were based in India (21% for _FunkLocker_; 33% for _KillSec_). eCrime service providers support APJ activity by supplying the tools, infrastructure, and support cybercriminals need to scale phishing, malware distribution, and monetization operations. The report examines CDNCLOUD (bulletproof hosting), Graves International SMS (global SMS spam service), and _Magical Cat_ (phishing-as-a-service). In terms of tools used, CrowdStrike Intelligence has identified likely Chinese-speaking eCrime actors using remote access tools (RATs) to target Chinese and Japanese speakers. _ChangemeRAT_, _ElseRAT_, and _WhiteFoxRAT_ were among the tools deployed through SEO poisoning, malvertising, and phishing attacks disguised as purchase orders. ## Meet the SPIDERs Operating in APJ CrowdStrike tracks several eCrime adversaries targeting the region and four active eCrime adversaries based in the region, all tracked under the SPIDER moniker. These include: - **CHARIOT SPIDER**: Vietnam-based adversary that has compromised Microsoft IIS and Adobe ColdFusion web servers - **RADIANT SPIDER**: Chinese adversary that uses formjacking to harvest payment card data - **SINFUL SPIDER**: Chinese adversary that uses password spraying and vulnerability exploitation in internet-facing applications - **SOLAR SPIDER**: Targets banking and foreign exchanges using finance-themed phishing Apart from SOLAR SPIDER, these adversaries are primarily opportunistic and have not been observed concertedly targeting the region. While CrowdStrike Intelligence has not seen APJ eCrime actors explicitly prohibit regional targeting, Chinese-speaking marketplaces’ rules and emphasis on anonymity indicate they hope to avoid law enforcement attention. Organizations in the region should prioritize defending against these adversaries by focusing on their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), while strengthening identity protections, securing cloud and SaaS environments, and preparing for ransomware and social engineering threats.

The incident occurred at a reactor in the Bateias substation operated by Eletrobras, which is part of a 500-kilovolt (kV) high-voltage transmission line. The fire caused the shutdown of about 10 gigawatts (GW) of power. While some regions experienced only brief outages, others were left without electricity for over two hours. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met with Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira at the presidential palace just hours after returning from an overseas trip to discuss the incident. The blackout activated the Regional Load Relief Scheme (ERAC), a safety protocol that automatically disconnects parts of the system to prevent broader damage. Authorities downplayed the event and rejected the notion of a systemic crisis. Mr. Silveira called it a one-off infrastructure issue, saying Brazil’s national grid operator, ONS, responded promptly. - [Generation mismatch puts Brazil at risk of blackout](https://valorinternational.globo.com/economy/news/2025/09/22/generation-mismatch-puts-brazil-at-risk-of-blackout.ghtml) - [BNDES to review debt standstill requests from energy companies](https://valorinternational.globo.com/business/news/2025/10/14/bndes-to-review-debt-standstill-requests-from-energy-companies.ghtml) ONS said the fire severed the connection between the southern grid and the Southeast and Central-West regions, prompting a preventive supply cut across the country in varying degrees. The Ministry of Mines and Energy classified the incident as a “severe contingency.” In a statement, ONS said it began a coordinated response to restore power as soon as the situation was identified. Electricity was reestablished in the North, Northeast, Southeast, and Central-West regions within 90 minutes. Full restoration in the South took about two and a half hours. ONS Director-General Marcio Rea said in the statement that the agency quickly reestablished the system, “demonstrating the robustness of the National Interconnected System (SIN).” He described the event as a controlled power interruption caused by a “fortuitous incident,” the type of failure that could happen in any country. Eletrobras said the shutdown was triggered by a “reactor incident” and that power was restored shortly after. “ONS will determine what led to the larger disturbance in the national system. Eletrobras will collaborate in identifying the causes,” the company said. **System resilience** While experts acknowledged the system’s general robustness, the scale of the outage raised concerns. Luiz Carlos Ciocchi, former ONS director-general, said the blackout was “very different” from a 2023 incident that did not involve a fire. “The first question that needs answering is what exactly happened at the substation and why a fire in one component shut down an entire plant,” he said. Mr. Ciocchi added that the automatic protection scheme worked as intended, but further analysis was needed. “System security must always be a top priority in the power sector,” he said. He noted that the fire happened during low consumption hours and in a region without high renewable output. “The key is understanding what went wrong.” Power systems engineer Celso Torino pointed out that the 10GW outage was almost equivalent to power plant Itaipu’s capacity of 14 GW. “We need to better understand why a reactor fire at a 500kV substation caused the complete shutdown of 750kV lines connecting Itaipu’s 60-hertz output to Southeast Brazil,” said Mr. Torino, a former Itaipu operations director. “The N-1 security criterion tells us this shouldn’t happen.” He referred to the N-1 standard, which requires the grid to withstand the loss of a key component without triggering cascading failures. Mr. Torino said the episode calls for a broader governance review of the national grid, including planning, operational stability, and consumer cost structures. Carlos Adolfo Pereira, who heads the transmission division at the Brazilian Infrastructure and Basic Industry Association (ABDIB), said it was too soon to conclude there was a substation failure and a more detailed assessment was needed. He noted that the industry has been investing in modernizing transmission systems, especially replacing outdated equipment. “Transmission companies are expected to invest about R$40 billion through 2034 to upgrade old infrastructure,” he said. **“Reliability issue”** Edvaldo Santana, former director at energy regulator ANEEL and a columnist for Valor, said the blackout was one of the most significant in recent memory. The August 2023 outage cut 22.5GW of supply, while a 2010 failure involving Itaipu lines knocked out about 11GW. Mr. Santana questioned how a fire in a single reactor—typically considered a minor contingency—could affect the entire country, especially during low demand at around 12:30 a.m. “Even for a critical substation, a reactor fire should have been contained locally. This is a serious reliability issue,” he said. Industry sources described the Bateias substation as strategically important, part of a high-capacity 500kV line, but said it should have withstood the failure. The widespread impact indicates the system is “sensitive” to minor incidents, they said. Experts warned the event reinforces a troubling conclusion: Brazil’s grid remains “on a knife’s edge,” not due to energy shortages but because of a combination of structural weaknesses. These include fragile transmission infrastructure, equipment failures, excessive daytime solar generation followed by steep nighttime demand ramps, and networks that remain ill-equipped for extreme weather events. **Repeat of a known pattern** The event echoed a familiar pattern seen since the August 15, 2023 blackout. An ONS report blamed that outage on voltage control failures in wind and solar farms. Since then, the operator has adopted a more conservative management approach. Still, Brazil has experienced at least five major blackouts since then. Even minor incidents have had an impact. In August last year, a short circuit at an Eletrobras substation caused by a stray kite left 942,000 households without power in São Paulo and Guarulhos. Heavy rains also knocked down transmission lines and damaged dams in Rio Grande do Sul, while storms cut power to millions in the São Paulo metro area. In both cases, authorities struggled to respond quickly, leaving consumers in the dark for days. Specialists advocate for capacity auctions and technologies such as batteries and reversible power plants to improve grid resilience. “Until 2021, utilities invested R$18 billion a year. By 2025, that number will rise to R$46 billion. From 2025 to 2029, we expect R$235 billion in total investments, with 40% focused on modernizing networks,” said Ricardo Brandão, executive director for regulation at the Brazilian Association of Electricity Distributors (ABRADEE). The blackout comes just as Brazil prepares to transition from the dry season to the rainy period, which starts in November. There is still uncertainty over rainfall patterns and the recovery of hydropower reservoirs. Operational challenges are compounded by the rapid growth of renewables and pricing distortions that create additional costs for consumers and threaten the sector’s balance. Brazil narrowly avoided two national blackouts this year, one in April and another on Father’s Day, August 10. With low daytime demand, rooftop and small-scale solar generation surged to record levels, forcing ONS to disconnect large wind and solar parks to avoid overloads. Such incidents occur when the grid lacks infrastructure to carry excess generation, or when supply outpaces demand.

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. ## Document Type Book ## Publication Date 10-2016 ## Publisher National Defense University Press ## City Washington, DC ## Recommended Citation Lynch, Thomas F.

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

The final phase of the investigations was scheduled by the Commission following notification of preliminary determinations by Commerce that imports of aluminum extrusions from China, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey were subsidized within the meaning of section 703(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1671b(b)) and that imports of aluminum extrusions from China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam were sold at LTFV within the meaning of 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the scheduling of the final phase of the Commission’s investigations and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the Federal Register on May 23, 2024 (89 FR 45677).4 The Commission conducted its hearing on October 1, 2024. All persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to participate. 4 The Commission subsequently revised its schedule in a notice published in the Federal Register on August 16, 2024 (89 FR 66738). 3 Views of the Commission Based on the record in the final phase of these investigations, we determine that an industry in the United States is not materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports of aluminum extrusions from China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), and Vietnam found by the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) to be sold at less than fair value (“LTFV”) and subsidized by the governments of China, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey. 1 2 Background The petitions in these investigations were filed on October 4, 2023, by the U.S. Aluminum Extruders Coalition, consisting of extruders of aluminum,3 and the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (“the USW”), a union representing workers at domestic extruders’ production facilities (collectively, “Petitioners”).

Responding U.S. importers also accounted for *** percent of nonsubject imports and *** percent of total imports in 2023.7 The Commission received responses to its questionnaires from 61 foreign producers of subject merchandise: six firms in China; two firms in Colombia; two firms in Ecuador; five firms in India; five firms in Indonesia; seven firms in Italy; four firms in Malaysia; 12 firms in Mexico; one firm in Taiwan; two firms in Thailand; 10 firms in Turkey; one firm in the UAE; and four firms in Vietnam.8 6 Confidential Staff Report, INV-WW-130 (Oct 17, 2024), as revised by INV-WW-134 (Oct. 23, 2024) and INV-WW-135 (Oct. 30, 2024) (“CR”) at III-1. 7 CR/PR at IV-2. The percentages reflect the volume of imports reported in importer questionnaire responses for each country source (or sources) as a percentage of adjusted official import statistics entering under the primary HTS numbers under which imports are believed to have entered as indicated in Commerce’s scope definition. Official import statistics for imports entering under the primary HTS numbers data were adjusted using data submitted in Commission questionnaires to break out nonsubject imports from China subject to existing orders, add in reported in-scope imports under the non-primary HTS statistical reporting numbers, and subtract out-of-scope merchandise. Proprietary Census-edited, Customs records were used to subtract out-of-scope merchandise and merchandise imported by firms that certified their imports did not include in-scope products. These data were also used to report subject and nonsubject imports from India, Italy, Malysia, South Korea, and Taiwan. See CR/PR at IV-1 n.2. 8 CR/PR at VII-3. These firms’ exports are estimated to account for the following shares of subject imports during 2023: *** percent of subject imports from China; *** percent of subject imports from Colombia; *** percent of subject imports from Ecuador; *** percent of subject imports from India; *** percent of subject imports from Indonesia; *** percent of subject imports from Italy; *** percent of subject imports from Malaysia; *** percent of subject imports from Mexico; *** percent of subject (Continued...) 6 Domestic Like Product A. In General In determining whether an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports of subject merchandise, the Commission first defines the “domestic like product” and the “industry.”9 Section 771(4)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (“the Tariff Act”), defines the relevant domestic industry as the “producers as a whole of a domestic like product, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product.”10 In turn, the Tariff Act defines “domestic like product” as “a product which is like, or in the absence of like, most similar in characteristics and uses with, the article subject to an investigation.”11 By statute, the Commission’s “domestic like product” analysis begins with the “article subject to an investigation,” i.e., the subject merchandise as determined by Commerce.12 Therefore, Commerce’s determination as to the scope of the imported merchandise that is subsidized and/or sold at less than fair value is “necessarily the starting point of the Commission’s like product analysis.”13 The Commission then defines the domestic like product in light of the imported articles Commerce has identified.14 The decision regarding the imports from South Korea; *** percent of subject imports from Taiwan; *** percent of subject imports from Thailand; *** percent of subject imports from Turkey; *** percent of subject imports from the UAE; and *** percent of subject imports from Vietnam. CR/PR at VII-4. Shares are based on the shares of adjusted imports as presented in Table IV-2. CR/PR at VII-4 n.5. 9 19 U.S.C. § 1677(4)(A). 10 19 U.S.C. § 1677(4)(A). 11 19 U.S.C. § 1677(10). 12 19 U.S.C. § 1677(10). The Commission must accept Commerce’s determination as to the scope of the imported merchandise that is subsidized and/or sold at less than fair value. See, e.g., USEC, Inc. v. United States, 34 Fed. App’x 725, 730 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (“The ITC may not modify the class or kind of imported merchandise examined by Commerce.”); Algoma Steel Corp. v. United States, 688 F. Supp. 639, 644 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1988), aff’d, 865 F.3d 240 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 919 (1989). 13 Cleo Inc. v. United States, 501 F.3d 1291, 1298 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Hitachi Metals, Ltd. V. United States, 949 F.3d 710, 715 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (the statute requires the Commission to start with Commerce’s subject merchandise in reaching its own like product determination). 14 Cleo, 501 F.3d at 1298 n.1 (“Commerce’s {scope} finding does not control the Commission’s {like product} determination.”); Hosiden Corp. v. Advanced Display Mfrs., 85 F.3d 1561, 1568 (Fed. Cir. (Continued...) 7 appropriate domestic like product(s) in an investigation is a factual determination, and the Commission has applied the statutory standard of “like” or “most similar in characteristics and uses” on a case-by-case basis.15 No single factor is dispositive, and the Commission may consider other factors it deems relevant based on the facts of a particular investigation.16 The Commission looks for clear dividing lines among possible like products and disregards minor variations.17 B. Product Description Commerce defined the scope of the imported merchandise under investigation as follows: The merchandise subject to this investigation are aluminum extrusions, regardless of form, finishing, or fabrication, whether assembled with other parts or unassembled, whether coated, painted, anodized, or thermally improved. Aluminum extrusions are shapes and forms, produced by an extrusion process, made from aluminum alloys having metallic elements corresponding to the alloy series designations published by the Aluminum Association commencing with 1996) (the Commission may find a single like product corresponding to several different classes or kinds defined by Commerce); Torrington Co. v. United States, 747 F. Supp. 744, 748–52 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1990), aff’d, 938 F.2d 1278 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (affirming the Commission’s determination defining six like products in investigations where Commerce found five classes or kinds). 15 See, e.g., Cleo Inc. v. United States, 501 F.3d 1291, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2007); NEC Corp. v. Department of Commerce, 36 F. Supp. 2d 380, 383 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1998); Nippon Steel Corp. v.

Cir. 1991) (“every like product determination ‘must be made on the particular record at issue’ and the ‘unique facts of each case’”). The Commission generally considers a number of factors, including the following: (1) physical characteristics and uses; (2) interchangeability; (3) channels of distribution; (4) customer and producer perceptions of the products; (5) common manufacturing facilities, production processes, and production employees; and, where appropriate, (6) price. See Nippon, 19 CIT at 455 n.4; Timken Co. v. United States, 913 F. Supp. 580, 584 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1996). 16 See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 96-249 at 90-91 (1979). 17 Nippon, 19 CIT at 455; Torrington, 747 F. Supp. at 748-49; see also S. Rep. No. 96-249 at 90-91 (Congress has indicated that the like product standard should not be interpreted in “such a narrow fashion as to permit minor differences in physical characteristics or uses to lead to the conclusion that the product and article are not ‘like’ each other, nor should the definition of ‘like product’ be interpreted in such a fashion as to prevent consideration of an industry adversely affected by the imports under consideration.”). 8 the numbers 1, 3, and 6 (or proprietary equivalents or other certifying body equivalents). Specifically, subject aluminum extrusions made from an aluminum alloy with an Aluminum Association series designation commencing with the number 1 contain not less than 99 percent aluminum by weight. Subject aluminum extrusions made from an aluminum alloy with an Aluminum Association series designation commencing with the number 3 contain manganese as the major alloying element, with manganese accounting for not more than 3.0 percent of total materials by weight. Subject aluminum extrusions made from an aluminum alloy with an Aluminum Association series designation commencing with the number 6 contain magnesium and silicon as the major alloying elements, with magnesium accounting for at least 0.1 percent but not more than 2.0 percent of total materials by weight, and silicon accounting for at least 0.1 percent but not more than 3.0 percent of total materials by weight. The scope also includes merchandise made from an aluminum alloy with an Aluminum Association series designation commencing with the number 5 (or proprietary equivalents or other certifying body equivalents) that have a magnesium content accounting for up to but not more than 2.0 percent of total materials by weight. The country of origin of the aluminum extrusion is determined by where the metal is extruded (i.e., pressed through a die). Aluminum extrusions are produced and imported in a wide variety of shapes and forms, including, but not limited to, hollow profiles, other solid profiles, pipes, tubes, bars, and rods. Aluminum extrusions that are drawn subsequent to extrusion (drawn aluminum) are also included in the scope. Subject aluminum extrusions are produced and imported with a variety of coatings and surface treatments, and types of fabrication. The types of coatings and treatments applied to aluminum extrusions include, but are not limited to, extrusions that are mill finished (i.e., without any coating or further finishing), brushed, buffed, polished, anodized (including bright dip), liquid painted, electroplated, chromate converted, powder coated, sublimated, wrapped, and/or bead blasted. Subject aluminum extrusions may also be fabricated, i.e., prepared for assembly, or thermally improved. Such operations would include, but are not limited to, 9 extrusions that are cut-to-length, machined, drilled, punched, notched, bent, stretched, stretch-formed, hydroformed, knurled, swedged, mitered, chamfered, threaded, spun, etched, and engraved. Performing such operations in third countries does not otherwise remove the merchandise from the scope of the investigation. The types of products that meet the definition of subject merchandise include but are not limited to, the aluminum extrusion portions of vehicle roof rails and sun/moon roof framing, solar panel racking rails and framing, tradeshow display fixtures and framing, parts for tents or clear span structures, fence posts, drapery rails or rods, electrical conduits, door thresholds, flooring trim, electric vehicle battery trays, heat sinks, signage or advertising poles, telescoping poles, or cleaning system components. Aluminum extrusions may be heat sinks, which are fabricated aluminum extrusions that dissipate heat away from a heat source and may serve other functions, such as structural functions. Heat sinks come in a variety of sizes and shapes, including but not limited to a flat electronic heat sink, which is a solid aluminum extrusion with at least one flat side used to mount electronic or mechanical devices; a heat sink that is a housing for electronic controls or motors; lighting heat sinks, which dissipate heat away from LED devices; and process and exchange heat sinks, which are tube extrusions with fins or plates used to hold radiator tubing. Heat sinks are included in the scope, regardless of whether the design and production of the heat sinks are organized around meeting specified thermal performance requirements and regardless of whether they have been tested to comply with such requirements. For purposes of the investigations on aluminum extrusions from the People’s Republic of China, only heat sinks designed and produced around meeting specified thermal performance requirements and tested to comply with such requirements are included in the scope. Excluded from the scope of the investigation are large, multifinned extruded aluminum heat sinks designed to dissipate heat, meeting the following criteria: (1) an aspect ratio (defined as the ratio of the area of a void in an extrusion to the size of the smallest gap opening at the entrance of that void and calculated by dividing the void area by the square of the gap 10 opening) greater than 15 to 1; or (2) the circumscribing circle diameter (defined as the diameter of the smallest circle that will entirely enclose the extrusion’s cross-sectional profile) rounded up to the next half inch, exceeds 10 inches, and the weight-per-foot (defined as the theoretical weight of the profile as extruded prior to any machining that may remove material and calculated by multiplying the area of the profile in square inches by 1.2) exceeds 3.50 pounds per foot. Merchandise that is comprised solely of aluminum extrusions or aluminum extrusions and fasteners, whether assembled at the time of importation or unassembled, is covered by the scope in its entirety. A fastener is any material or part that serves an attachment function, fastens two or more components, or serves to prevent or restrict movement of a component or another item. Examples of fasteners include, but are not limited to, nuts, bolts, clamps, and end caps. The scope also includes aluminum extrusions contained in merchandise that is a part or subassembly of a larger whole, whether or not the merchandise also contains a component other than aluminum extrusions that is beyond a fastener. Such merchandise may be either assembled or unassembled at the time of importation. A ‘‘part or subassembly’’ is defined as a unit designed to be attached to, or incorporated with, one or more other units or components into a larger completed product. Only the aluminum extrusion portion of the merchandise described in this paragraph, whether assembled or unassembled, is subject merchandise included in the scope and subject to duties. Examples of merchandise that is a part or subassembly of a larger whole include, but are not limited to, window parts or subassemblies; door unit parts or subassemblies; shower and bath parts or subassemblies; solar panel mounting systems; fenestration system parts or subassemblies, such as units which make up a curtain wall, and window walls and window wall units, which collectively make up a fenestration system on the side of a building; and parts or subassemblies of storefronts; furniture parts or subassemblies; appliance parts or subassemblies, such as fin evaporator coils and systems for refrigerators; railing or deck system parts or subassemblies; fence system parts or subassemblies; motor vehicle parts or subassemblies, such as bumpers for motor vehicles; trailer parts or 11 subassemblies, such as side walls, flooring, and roofings; electric vehicle charging station parts or subassemblies; or signage or advertising system parts or subassemblies. Parts or subassemblies described by this paragraph that are subject to duties in their entirety pursuant to existing antidumping and countervailing duty orders (defined as those antidumping and countervailing duty orders that are in effect as of the date of publication of order resulting from this investigation) are excluded from the scope of this investigation. Any part or subassembly that otherwise meets the requirements of this scope and that is not covered by other antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders remains subject to the scope of the investigation. The scope excludes aluminum extrusions contained in fully and permanently assembled merchandise, if the assembled merchandise is not a part or subassembly of a larger whole. To be excluded under this paragraph, the assembled merchandise must also contain a component other than aluminum extrusions, beyond fasteners. In addition, to be excluded under this paragraph, the assembled merchandise must be ready for use as imported, without undergoing after importation any processing, fabrication, finishing, or assembly or the addition of parts or material (with the exception of consumable parts or material or interchangeable media or tooling). The scope also excludes aluminum extrusions contained in unassembled merchandise if the unassembled merchandise is not a part or subassembly of a larger whole. To be excluded under this paragraph, the unassembled merchandise must also contain a component other than aluminum extrusions, beyond fasteners. In addition, to be excluded under this paragraph, the unassembled merchandise must be a packaged combination of parts that is ready to be assembled as imported, without undergoing after importation any processing, fabrication, or finishing or the addition of parts or material (with the exception of consumable parts or material or interchangeable media or tooling). To be excluded under this paragraph, the unassembled merchandise must be sold and enter as a discrete kit on one Customs entry form. 12 Examples of such excluded assembled and unassembled merchandise include windows with glass, door units with door panel and glass, motor vehicles, trailers, furniture, appliances, and solar panels and solar modules. Window walls and window wall units are not considered windows with glass for purposes of this exclusion. The scope also excludes merchandise containing multiple subassemblies of a larger whole with non-extruded aluminum components beyond fasteners. A subassembly that meets the definition of subject merchandise, including any product expressly identified as subject merchandise in this scope, can only be excluded if it is fully and permanently assembled with at least one other different subassembly, and where (1) at least one of the subassemblies, if entered individually, would not itself be subject to the scope; (2) the aluminum extrusions within the merchandise collectively account for 50 percent or less of the actual weight of the combined multiple subassemblies (without including any non-extruded aluminum fasteners in the calculations); and (3) the aluminum extrusions within the merchandise collectively account for 50 percent or less of the number of pieces of the combined multiple subassemblies (without including any non-extruded aluminum fasteners in the calculations). The scope also includes aluminum extrusions that have been further processed in a third country, including, but not limited to, the finishing and fabrication processes described above, assembly, whether with other aluminum extrusion components or with non-aluminum extrusion components, or any other processing that would not otherwise remove the merchandise from the scope if performed in the country of manufacture of the in-scope product. Third country processing; finishing; and/or fabrication, including those processes described in the scope, does not alter the country of origin of the subject aluminum extrusions. The following aluminum extrusion products are excluded: aluminum extrusions made from an aluminum alloy with an Aluminum Association series designations commencing with the number 2 (or proprietary equivalents or other certifying body equivalents) and containing in excess of 1.5 percent copper by weight; 13 aluminum extrusions made from an aluminum alloy with an Aluminum Association series designation commencing with the number 5 (or proprietary equivalents or other certifying body equivalents) and containing in excess of 2.0 percent magnesium by weight; and aluminum extrusions made from an aluminum alloy with an Aluminum Association series designation commencing with the number 7 (or proprietary equivalents or other certifying body equivalents) and containing in excess of 2.0 percent zinc by weight.

They are produced with various finishes, coatings, and surface treatments.22 The scope definition covers all in-scope aluminum extrusions, regardless of whether the extrusion has been fabricated. The scope definition indicates that fabrication includes, but is not limited to, cutting to length, machining, drilling, punching, notching, bending, stretching, knurling, swedging, mitering, chamfering, threading, and spinning, except as otherwise specified in Commerce’s scope definition.23 18 See, e.g., Aluminum Extrusions From the People’s Republic of China: Final Affirmative Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, 89 Fed. Reg. 80,506, 80,509-11 (Oct. 3, 2024). 19 The scope now defines a ‘‘part or subassembly’’ as a “unit designed to be attached to, or incorporated with, one or more other units or components into a larger completed product.” 20 The revised scope also excludes aluminum extrusions contained in unassembled merchandise if the unassembled merchandise is not a part or subassembly of a larger whole. Examples of such excluded assembled and unassembled merchandise include windows with glass, door units with door panel and glass, motor vehicles, trailers, furniture, appliances, and solar panels and solar modules. The scope also excludes merchandise containing multiple subassemblies of a larger whole with non-extruded aluminum components beyond fasteners if they satisfy a three-part weight and piece test. See also Hearing Tr. at 76-78, 154-55 (DeFrancesco). Also excluded from the scope are extruded drawn solid profiles meeting certain specifications. Also excluded from the scope are extruded tubing and drawn over a ID plug and through a OD die made from an aluminum alloy meeting certain specifications. The scope also excludes fully and permanently assembled glass refrigerator shelves with decorative aluminum trim meeting certain characteristics. Also excluded are large, multifinned extruded aluminum heat sinks meeting certain specifications. 21 CR/PR at I-36. Aluminum alloys include other elements such as iron, silicon, copper, magnesium, manganese, and zinc in order to enhance alloys’ properties. CR/PR at Table I-21. 22 CR/PR at I-36. 23 CR/PR at I-36. 19 Aluminum extrusions can be imported with other components attached in addition to fasteners.24 Aluminum extrusions are in-scope merchandise if contained in merchandise that is a part or subassembly of a larger whole, whether or not the merchandise also contains a component other than aluminum extrusions that is beyond a fastener.25 The scope clarifies that it excludes “aluminum extrusions contained in fully and permanently assembled merchandise, if the assembled merchandise is not a part or subassembly of a larger whole.” The scope definition excludes merchandise subject to the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on aluminum extrusions from China issued in May 2011, but the scope states that certain merchandise not subject to the existing orders on aluminum extrusions from China, such as finished heat sinks, are included in the scope definition in these China investigations.26 C. Arguments of the Parties Petitioners’ Arguments. Petitioners ask the Commission to define a single domestic like product coextensive with the scope, as it did in the preliminary phase of these investigations. It contends that aluminum extrusions are a product that exists on a broad continuum without clear dividing lines, as the Commission has consistently found with respect to this product. Petitioners assert that the scope language now more clearly states that only the aluminum extrusion portion of subassemblies falls within the scope of the investigations.27 Petitioners argue that there is no clear dividing line between Crash Relevant extrusions (“CR extrusions”) and all other in-scope aluminum extrusions (“OCR extrusions”), contrary to Tesla’s argument. It submits that CR extrusions share the same general physical characteristics 24 The scope defines a fastener as any material or part that serves an attachment function, fastens two or more components, or serves to prevent or restrict movement of a component or another item. Examples of fasteners include, but are not limited to, nuts, bolts, clamps, and end caps. 25 The scope gives the following examples of a part or subassembly of larger whole: window parts or subassemblies; door unit parts or subassemblies; shower and bath parts or subassemblies; solar panel mounting systems; fenestration system parts or subassemblies, such as units which make up a curtain wall, and window walls and window wall units, which collectively make up a fenestration system on the side of a building; and parts or subassemblies of storefronts; furniture parts or subassemblies; appliance parts or subassemblies, such as fin evaporator coils and systems for refrigerators; railing or deck system parts or subassemblies; fence system parts or subassemblies; motor vehicle parts or subassemblies, such as bumpers for motor vehicles; trailer parts or subassemblies, such as side walls, flooring, and roofings; electric vehicle charging station parts or subassemblies; or signage or advertising system parts or subassemblies. 26 See CR/PR at I-24 to I-25. 27 Petitioners’ Prehearing Br. at 5-7. 20 as other aluminum extrusions and are produced by the same U.S. extruders, in the same facilities, with the same workers, and on the same equipment as other aluminum extrusions. They argue CR extrusions are sold to the same automotive customers as many other aluminums extrusions and are perceived by producers and customers to fall within the same general product category of aluminum extrusions. Finally, they claim that pricing data show that CR extrusions are within the same range of prices as other aluminum extrusions.28 Respondents’ Arguments. Tesla argues that the Commission should define CR extrusions as a separate domestic like product. It contends that CR extrusions are engineered to absorb or deflect energy in the event of a collision, thereby protecting vehicle occupants. Because of CR extrusions’ vital role in vehicle safety, it contends that there is a clear dividing line between CR extrusions and all other in-scope extrusions under each of the six like product factors considered by the Commission.29 Tesla contends that CR extrusions must be produced to more exacting specifications than other extrusions. It further claims that the production process for CR extrusions differs significantly from that of other extrusions. It claims that the majority of domestic extrusion facilities cannot and do not produce CR extrusions, because they lack the required equipment, processes, and labor. 30 Tesla also claims that CR extrusions sell at higher prices than other extrusions because of the greater time required for their production and more expensive raw materials.31 Reflection argues that its window wall units or systems32 should be defined as a separate domestic like product. It argues that, despite scope language to the contrary, the Commission should consider the whole window wall unit assembly as subject merchandise because window wall units are the product that is actually imported, and then define a separate domestic like product corresponding to window wall units.33 It further contends that 28 Petitioners’ Posthearing Br., Answers to Questions at 62. 29 Tesla’s Prehearing Br. at 21. 30 Tesla’s Prehearing Br. at 23-24 and Attachment A (*** Declaration); Tesla’s Posthearing Br., Answers to Questions at 6. 31 Tesla’s Prehearing Br. at 32-34. 32 Fenestration systems, commonly referred to as window wall systems or window wall units are used to install windows in high-rise buildings.

Domestic Like Product Analysis Based on the record in the final phase of these investigations, we define a single domestic like product consisting of all aluminum extrusions, coextensive with the scope, as the Commission did in its preliminary determinations.35 In its preliminary determinations, the Commission found that the scope encompassed a variety of aluminum alloy products in different shapes and forms that were subjected to varying amounts of finishing and fabrication processes but generally manufactured in the same facilities using the same processes and employees, at least at the extrusion stage but often in additional stages of finishing and fabrication. It found that all in-scope aluminum extrusions shared similar channels of distribution, were perceived by producers and customers as a general category of products and were priced along a continuum according to the same pricing formula. While recognizing that certain aluminum extrusions designed for specific end uses were not interchangeable with other aluminum extrusions, the Commission found this lack of interchangeability to be characteristic of products on a continuum. It noted that when faced with such a continuum of products, the Commission generally does not define each type of product as a separate domestic like product, as the only product “like” the corresponding subject imported product, but rather considers the continuum itself to constitute a single domestic like product. The Commission therefore concluded that it was appropriate to include all aluminum extrusions in a single domestic like product.36 The Commission also rejected respondents’ arguments that subassemblies containing aluminum extrusions (such as window wall units) are entirely in-scope merchandise and should 34 Reflection’s Prehearing Br. at 4-7. 35 See Aluminum Extrusions from China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, Inv.

Respondents contended that, notwithstanding that only the aluminum extrusion portion of subassemblies would be subject to any duties, the Commission should consider the subassemblies in their entirety as in-scope merchandise. Rejecting this argument, the Commission found that the subject merchandise relevant to its like product analysis included the aluminum extrusion components of subassemblies, but not the entire subassemblies.37 Because the entire subassemblies, such as window wall systems, assemblies, and complex aluminum parts, were not subject merchandise, the Commission would not define the domestically produced products corresponding to such subassemblies as separate domestic like products. While recognizing that the definition of the domestic like product may be expanded to include out-of-scope merchandise when no clear dividing line separates such merchandise from in-scope merchandise, the Commission explained that it would be inappropriate to define a separate domestic like product corresponding to out-of\u0002scope merchandise.38 The Commission also rejected respondents’ arguments that finished heat sinks, water heater anodes, and aluminum pipe and tubes should be defined as separate domestic like products. It found that these products, and other aluminum extrusions, were part of a single domestic like product comprising a continuum of products. The particular products argued by respondents primarily differed from other types of domestically produced aluminum extrusions in terms of their distinctive physical characteristics and end uses. It found that such 37 The Commission also observed that this is not the only instance in which Commerce defined the scope of an investigation to encompass only portions of a subassembly.

It observed that for the Commission to include out-of\u0002scope merchandise in its domestic like product definition, the Commission would need to find that there is no clear dividing line between in-scope and out-of-scope merchandise. Then, in order to find separate domestic like products, the Commission would need to find that there is a clear dividing line between the in-scope and out-of-scope merchandise. Id. at 23 n.51. 23 distinctions, and the resulting lack of interchangeability with other types of aluminum extrusions, were typical of products that exist on a continuum.39 We discuss below whether window wall units or CR extrusions should be defined as separate domestic like products. 1. Whether Window Wall Units Should be Defined as a Separate Domestic Like Product As in the preliminary phase of the investigations, Reflection urges the Commission to define window wall units as a separate domestic like product. The Commission in its Preliminary Determinations explained why it would be inappropriate to define a separate domestic like product corresponding to out-of-scope merchandise. Defining a separate domestic like product corresponding to out-of-scope merchandise would be internally inconsistent because the Commission would first need to find that there is no clear dividing line between in-scope and out-of-scope merchandise and then, to define the out-of-scope merchandise as a separate like product, find that there is a clear dividing line between the in\u0002scope and out-of-scope merchandise.40 Reflection does not challenge the Commission’s reasoning or conclusion from the preliminary determinations based on its finding that only the aluminum extrusion portion of the window wall unit is subject merchandise.41 Indeed, Commerce’s final determination clearly indicates that “{o}nly the aluminum extrusion portion of the merchandise described in this paragraph . . . is subject merchandise included in the scope and subject to duties.”42 Therefore, for the same reasons the Commission provided in its 39 Preliminary Determinations at 30-31, 33-35. 40 Preliminary Determinations at 22-23 & n.51. 41 In its initiation notice, Commerce indicated that “{o}nly the aluminum extrusion portion of the merchandise described in this paragraph, whether assembled or unassembled, is subject to duties.” Respondents argued that this language did not indicate that only the aluminum extrusion portion of the subassembly is subject merchandise.

Reg. 80,506, 80,509-11 (Oct. 3, 2024). 24 preliminary determinations, we do not define window wall units as a separate domestic like product. 2. Whether CR Extrusions Should be Defined as a Separate Domestic Like Product In its comments on the draft questionnaires for the final phase of the investigations, Tesla argued that because CR extrusions have distinct physical properties and are produced by different manufacturing processes, they should be defined as a separate domestic like product.43 Accordingly, the Commission collected trade and financial data on CR extrusions and OCR extrusions, and asked questionnaire respondents to rate the comparability and comment on the similarities and differences between CR extrusions and OCR extrusions with respect to the Commission’s six like product factors.44 We discuss below the information that industry participants reported with respect to the domestic like product factors. Physical Characteristics and Uses. The majority of U.S. producers (18 of 27) reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are fully comparable with respect to physical characteristics and uses.45 The majority of U.S. importers (12 of 22) reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are never comparable with respect to physical characteristic and uses, although five importers indicated that they are fully comparable, and five importers indicated that they are somewhat comparable.46 Three U.S. purchasers reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are sometimes comparable with respect to physical characteristic and uses, one purchaser reported that they are fully comparable, one reported that they are mostly comparable, and one reported that they are never comparable.47 Domestic producers most frequently commented on the similarities of CR extrusions and OCR extrusions.48 Of the U.S. producers of CR extrusions, nine of ten indicated they overlap in physical characteristics because both are often produced with series 6000 alloys. 49 While CR extrusions are typically produced to particular yield and tensile strengths, several 43 Tesla’s Comments on Draft Questionnaires (Feb. 2, 2024). 44 See CR/PR at Table I-22, Appendix D. 45 CR/PR at Table I-22. 46 CR/PR at Table I-22. 47 CR/PR at Table I-22. 48 See CR/PR at Appendix D. 49 See CR/PR at Appendix D. The vast majority of domestic producers indicated that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions have similar physical characteristics. See Id. 25 domestic producers noted that OCR extrusions may also be produced to the same yield and tensile strengths as CR extrusions.50 Domestic producers acknowledged different uses of CR extrusions and OCR extrusions but they also noted that OCR extrusions, like CR extrusions, may be used for automobile production.51 The ***, stated that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions “can share similar attributes” but the “physical profile designs, alloys, production methodologies, performance characteristics, and quality requirements are distinctly different.”52 Although many U.S. importers did not provide relevant information because they were unfamiliar with CR extrusions, several importers that reported importing CR extrusions (***) commented on the similarities and differences of CR and OCR extrusions.53 Most of these importers indicated that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are generally similar in physical attributes.54 *** indicated that there are “{s}imilar features between CR and non-CR parts however end results and applications differ.”55 *** stated that “all products are produced with 6000 series alloys but some products have similar shape but less than 240 Mpa and less than 260 Mpa tensile strength.”56 *** indicated that “CR extrusions and other extrusions share many of the same physical characteristics - alloys, strength, etc.”57 *** indicated that they are “fully comparable with customer specific requirements and IATF standards.”58 ***, however, emphasized the differences, stating that “CR extrusions must meet significantly different and more exacting physical characteristics as compared to other in-scope extrusions, including other automotive grade extrusions.”59 Manufacturing Facilities, Production Processes, and Production Workers. The majority of U.S. producers (18 of 27) reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are fully comparable with respect to manufacturing facilities, processes and workers.60 The majority of 50 See CR/PR at Table D-1 (***). 51 See e.g. CR/PR at Table D-1 (***). 52 CR/PR at Table D-1. 53 CR/PR at Table D-2.

The majority of U.S. producers (16 of 27) reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are fully interchangeable.70 The majority of U.S. importers (16 of 21) reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are never interchangeable.71 Three U.S. purchasers reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are never interchangeable, two reported that they are mostly interchangeable, and one purchaser reported that they are fully 61 CR/PR at Table I-22. 62 CR/PR at Table I-22. 63 See CR/PR at Table D-1. 64 See CR/PR at Table D-1 (***). *** at another facility in order to produce CR extrusions.

The majority of U.S. producers (21 of 26) reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are fully or mostly comparable with respect to customer and producer perceptions.74 The majority of U.S. importers (14 of 21) reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are never comparable with respect to customer and producer perceptions.75 Five purchasers reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are somewhat comparable with respect to customer and producer perceptions, two purchasers reported that they are fully comparable, and two reported that they are never comparable.76 Most domestic producers described similar customer and producer perceptions for CR and OCR extrusions. They reported that CR extrusions are marketed in the same manner to the same automotive customers as OCR extrusions.77 They also indicated that all aluminum extrusions are perceived to be different products with different uses, to a certain extent, and that CR extrusions are no different from OCR extrusions in this regard.78 *** reported that CR extrusions are viewed by producers and customers as similar to other structural aluminum extrusions, and *** explained that although “customers may view an individual product differently from another product, that is the case with all extrusions.”79 Of producers of CR extrusions, only *** reported that CR extrusions are perceived to be a unique product with special performance characteristics.80 Five importers (in addition to ***) reported that CR extrusions are viewed as a unique product because of their specifications and use.81 *** stated that “{b}oth producers and automotive OEMs recognize that CR extrusions are a wholly different product than other types of extrusions.”82 On the other hand, *** emphasized *** in terms of customer and producer 72 CR/PR at Table I-22. 73 CR/PR at Tables D-1, D-2, and D-3. 74 CR/PR at Table I-22. 75 CR/PR at Table I-22. 76 CR/PR at Table I-22. 77 See CR/PR at Table D-1. 78 See CR/PR at Table D-1. 79 CR/PR at Table D-1. 80 See CR/PR at Table D-1. 81 See CR/PR at Table D-2 (responses of ***). 82 See CR/PR at Table D-3. 28 perceptions.83 *** indicated that the products are “somewhat comparable since either will need to meet safety specifications.” 84 *** commented that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions differ in end use.85 Channels of Distribution. The majority of U.S. producers (21 of 26) reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are fully comparable with respect to channels of distribution.86 The majority of U.S. importers (12 of 19) reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are never comparable with respect to channels of distribution.87 Two purchasers reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are fully or mostly comparable with respect to channels of distribution, and one purchaser reported that they are never comparable.88 Domestic producers reported that CR extrusions are sold through the same channels of distribution as other automotive extrusions.89 *** noted that OCR extrusions are sold to a *** of end users; *** indicated that “CR extrusions are sold in distinct distribution channels to automotive original equipment manufacturers.”90 Importers *** indicated that the channels of distribution for CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are similar.91 The record indicates that approximately *** of CR extrusions are sold to automotive end users with the remainder sold to “other end users.”92 Approximately *** of OCR extrusions are sold to “other end users” with roughly *** sold to distributors, and the remaining *** percent of OCR extrusions sold to automotive end users.93 Price. The majority of U.S. producers (21 of 25) reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are fully or mostly comparable with respect to price.94 The majority of U.S. importers (12 of 18) reported that CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are never comparable with 83 See CR/PR at Table D-3. *** commented that “***.” Id. 84 See CR/PR at Table D-3. 85 See CR/PR at Table D-3. 86 CR/PR at Table I-22. 87 CR/PR at Table I-22. 88 CR/PR at Table I-22. 89 CR/PR at Table D-1. 90 CR/PR at Table D-1. 91 CR/PR at Table D-2. 92 See CR/PR at Table I-23. 93 See CR/PR at Table I-23.

Some CR extrusions have a price premium but that is no different from other non-CR extrusions that also have a price premium.”98 Among producers of CR extrusions, only *** indicated that CR extrusions are priced higher than OCR extrusions.99 Three importers in addition to *** reported that CR extrusions command higher prices than OCR extrusions.100 The Commission collected pricing information for CR extrusions.101 This information indicates that CR extrusions are priced similarly to OCR extrusions.102 Conclusion. We do not find a clear dividing line between CR extrusions and OCR extrusions. The record shows that there are substantial similarities between CR extrusions and OCR extrusions with respect to the Commission’s traditional domestic like product factors. CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are both primarily produced in series 6000 alloys and may overlap in specifications, such as yield strength and tensile strength.103 The majority of domestic producers manufacture CR extrusions and OCR extrusions in the same facilities with the same equipment and employees using the same production process.104 While some importers reported that CR extrusions are perceived to be a unique product, most domestic producers reported that producers and customers view CR extrusions as one type of aluminum extrusion.105 CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are both mostly sold directly to end users of 95 CR/PR at Table I-22. 96 CR/PR at Table I-22. 97 See CR/PR at Table D-1. 98 See CR/PR at Table D-1. 99 See CR/PR at Table D-1. 100 See CR/PR at Table D-2 (***). 101 See CR/PR at V-7 (pricing product 5). 102 See CR/PR at Tables I-24 and I-25 and Fig. I-3 103 See CR/PR at IV-25 and Table D-1; Petitioners’ Posthearing Br., Answers to Questions at 64 and Exhibit 31. 104 CR/PR at Table D-1. 105 CR/PR at Tables D-1 and D-2. 30 some type, with most CR extrusions and some OCR extrusions sold to automotive end users.106 Finally, CR extrusions and OCR extrusions are sold at comparable prices based on the same pricing formula.107 Furthermore, while CR extrusions are produced to particular specifications according to their end use, OCR extrusions are also produced to their own specifications for their particular end uses.108 For this reason, CR extrusions lack interchangeability with OCR extrusions, but this is generally true of all aluminum extrusions designed for specific end uses. Such a lack of interchangeability is typical of products that exist on a continuum.109 Based on the preponderance of similarities between CR extrusions and OCR extrusions, we do not define CR extrusions as a separate domestic like product for the final phase of these investigations. In sum, we define a single domestic like product consisting of all aluminum extrusions, coextensive with Commerce’s scope definition. Domestic Industry The domestic industry is defined as the domestic “producers as a whole of a domestic like product, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product.”110 In defining the domestic industry, the Commission’s general practice has been to include in the industry producers of all domestic production of the like product, whether toll-produced, captively consumed, or sold in the domestic merchant market. A. Related Parties We must determine whether any producer of the domestic like product should be excluded from the domestic industry pursuant to section 771(4)(B) of the Tariff Act. This provision allows the Commission, if appropriate circumstances exist, to exclude from the domestic industry producers that are related to an exporter or importer of subject merchandise 106 See CR/PR at Table I-23, D-1 and D-2. 107 CR/PR at Tables I-24, I-25, and D-1. 108 See CR/PR at Table D-1. 109 See Certain Steel Nails from China and the United Arab Emirates, Inv. Nos. 731-TA-1114-1115 (Preliminary), USITC Pub. 3939 at 8 (Aug. 2007); Carbon and Certain Alloy Steel Wire Rod from China, Germany, and Turkey, Inv.

We address each U.S. producer below. 111 See Torrington Co. v. United States, 790 F. Supp. 1161, 1168 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1992), aff’d without opinion, 991 F.2d 809 (Fed. Cir. 1993); Sandvik AB v.

Int’l Trade 1987). 112 The primary factors the Commission has examined in deciding whether appropriate circumstances exist to exclude a related party include the following: (1) the percentage of domestic production attributable to the importing producer; (2) the reason the U.S. producer has decided to import the product subject to investigation (whether the firm benefits from the LTFV sales or subsidies or whether the firm must import in order to enable it to continue production and compete in the U.S. market); (3) whether inclusion or exclusion of the related party will skew the data for the rest of the industry; (4) the ratio of import shipments to U.S. production for the imported product; and (5) whether the primary interest of the importing producer lies in domestic production or importation.

A domestic producer that does not itself import subject merchandise or does not share a corporate affiliation with an importer may nonetheless be deemed a related party if it controls a purchaser of large volumes of subject imports. See Statement of Administrative Action (“SAA”) at 858. The Commission has found such control to exist, for example, where the domestic producer’s purchases were responsible for a predominant proportion of an importer’s subject imports and the importer’s subject imports were substantial. See, e.g., Iron Construction Castings from Brazil, Canada, and China, Inv. Nos. 701-TA-248, 731-TA-262-263, 265 (Fourth Review), USITC Pub. 4655 at 11 (Dec. 2016); Chlorinated Isocyanurates from China and Spain, Inv.

In light of these considerations, and in the absence of any contrary argument, we find that appropriate circumstances do not exist to exclude *** from the domestic industry. Accordingly, consistent with our definition of the domestic like product, we define the domestic industry to include all domestic producers of aluminum extrusions. Negligible Imports Pursuant to Section 771(24) of the Tariff Act, imports from a subject country of merchandise corresponding to a domestic like product that account for less than 3 percent of all such merchandise imported into the United States during the most recent 12 months for which data are available preceding the filing of the petition shall be deemed negligible.163 The statute further provides that subject imports from a single country which comprise less than 3 percent of total such imports of the product may not be considered negligible if there are several countries subject to investigation with negligible imports and the sum of such imports from all those countries collectively accounts for more than 7 percent of the volume of all such merchandise imported into the United States.164 165 Imports from five of the 14 subject countries are above the statutory negligibility threshold for purposes of the antidumping duty investigations. Specifically, adjusted official import data indicate that from October 2022 through September 2023, the most recent 12- month period preceding the filing of the petitions, subject imports from China accounted for *** percent of total imports, subject imports from Indonesia accounted for *** percent of total imports, subject imports from Mexico accounted for *** percent of total imports, subject imports from Turkey accounted for *** percent of total imports, and subject imports from Vietnam accounted for *** percent of total imports.166 Because the relevant imports from each of these subject countries exceed the three percent negligibility threshold, we find that 163 19 U.S.C. §§ 1671b(a), 1673b(a), 1677(24)(A)(i), 1677(24)(B); see also 15 C.F.R. § 2013.1 (developing countries for purposes of 19 U.S.C. § 1677(36)). 164 19 U.S.C. § 1677(24)(A)(ii). 165 Petitioners stated that subject imports from all subject countries are not negligible. Petitioners’ Prehearing Br. at 28. Respondents do not address the issue. 166 CR/PR at Table IV-5. 38 imports from China, Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey, and Vietnam subject to the antidumping duty investigations are not negligible. Subject imports from China, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey are also above the statutory negligibility threshold for purposes of the countervailing duty investigations.167 Adjusted official import data indicate that from October 2022 through September 2023, subject imports from China accounted for *** percent of total imports, subject imports from Indonesia accounted for *** percent of total imports, subject imports from Mexico accounted for *** percent of total imports, and subject imports from Turkey accounted for *** percent of total imports.168 Because the relevant imports from each of these subject countries exceed the three percent negligibility threshold, we find that imports from China, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey subject to the countervailing duty investigations are not negligible. Subject imports from nine subject countries are below the 3 percent individual subject country statutory negligibility threshold in antidumping duty investigations and may be aggregated. Adjusted official import data indicate that subject imports from Colombia accounted for *** percent of total imports during the relevant period, subject imports from Ecuador accounted for *** percent of total imports, subject imports from India accounted for *** percent of total imports, subject imports from Italy accounted for *** percent of total imports, subject imports from Malaysia accounted for *** percent of total imports, subject imports from South Korea accounted for *** percent of total imports, subject imports from Taiwan accounted for *** percent of total imports, subject imports from Thailand accounted for *** percent of total imports, and subject imports from the UAE accounted for *** percent of total imports.169 In the aggregate, imports from these nine countries subject to the antidumping duty investigations accounted for *** percent of total imports.170 Because this exceeds the 7 percent statutory threshold pertinent to aggregated imports from individually negligible sources, we find that subject imports are not negligible with respect to the antidumping duty investigations on aluminum extrusions from Colombia, Ecuador, India, Italy, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the UAE. 167 CR/PR at Table IV-5. 168 CR/PR at Table IV-5. 169 CR/PR at Table IV-6. 170 CR/PR at Table IV-6. 39 Cumulation For purposes of evaluating the volume and effects for a determination of material injury by reason of subject imports, section 771(7)(G)(i) of the Tariff Act requires the Commission to cumulate subject imports from all countries as to which petitions were filed and/or investigations self-initiated by Commerce on the same day, if such imports compete with each other and with the domestic like product in the U.S. market. In assessing whether subject imports compete with each other and with the domestic like product, the Commission generally has considered four factors: (1) the degree of fungibility between subject imports from different countries and between subject imports and the domestic like product, including consideration of specific customer requirements and other quality related questions; (2) the presence of sales or offers to sell in the same geographic markets of subject imports from different countries and the domestic like product; (3) the existence of common or similar channels of distribution for subject imports from different countries and the domestic like product; and (4) whether the subject imports are simultaneously present in the market.171 While no single factor is necessarily determinative, and the list of factors is not exclusive, these factors are intended to provide the Commission with a framework for determining whether the subject imports compete with each other and with the domestic like product.172 Only a “reasonable overlap” of competition is required. 173 171 See Certain Cast-Iron Pipe Fittings from Brazil, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan, Inv.

Arguments of the Parties Petitioners argue that the Commission should cumulate subject imports from all subject countries for its analysis of present material injury by reason of subject imports. They contend that subject imports from all sources are fungible with each other and with domestically produced aluminum extrusions, as confirmed in their view by the questionnaire responses of U.S. producers, importers, and purchasers. They also highlight that responding purchasers indicated that subject imports and the domestic product are comparable with respect to all purchasing factors except price. Finally, they argue that subject imports from all sources and domestically produced aluminum extrusions compete in the same geographic markets and in the same channels of distribution, and that subject imports and domestically produced aluminum extrusions were simultaneously present in the U.S. market.174 The Government of Turkey argues that the Commission should not cross-cumulate subject imports in countervailing duty investigations with those in antidumping duty investigations for the Commission’s present material injury analysis.175 B. Analysis We consider subject imports from China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UAE, and Vietnam on a cumulated basis because the statutory criteria for cumulation are satisfied. As an initial matter, Petitioners filed the antidumping and countervailing duty petitions with respect to the subject countries on the same day, October 4, 2023.176 statutory requirement is satisfied if there is a reasonable overlap of competition.” H.R. Rep. No. 103- 316, Vol. I at 848 (1994) (citing Fundicao Tupy, S.A. v. United States, 678 F. Supp. at 902; see Goss Graphic Sys., Inc. v. United States, 33 F. Supp. 2d 1082, 1087 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1998) (“cumulation does not require two products to be highly fungible”); Wieland Werke, AG, 718 F. Supp. at 52 (“Completely overlapping markets are not required.”). 174 Petitioners’ Prehearing Br. at 31-38. 175 Government of Turkey’s Posthearing Br. at 9; Hearing Tr. at 26 (Basibug). Cross-cumulation is not an issue in these investigations. There are antidumping investigations with respect to all subject countries, and there are no producers excluded from any antidumping investigation for a country in which there is also a countervailing duty investigation. As a result, there are no imports subject to a countervailing duty investigation that are not also subject to an antidumping investigation. 176 None of the statutory exceptions to cumulation applies in these investigations. See 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(G)(ii). 41 Fungibility. Most responding U.S. producers, U.S. importers, and purchasers reported that subject imports from each source were either “always” or “frequently” interchangeable with the domestic like product and imports from other subject sources.177 With the exception of pricing, most responding purchasers rated domestically produced aluminum extrusions as comparable to aluminum extrusions imported from each subject country with respect to 16 enumerated factors that influence purchasing decisions.178 In addition, the Commission’s pricing data indicate overlap and head-to-head competition in sales of pricing product 1, the pricing product accounting for the largest volume of sales reported by domestic producers and importers, between domestically produced aluminum extrusions and subject imports from nine subject countries, and in sales of pricing product 2 between domestically produced aluminum extrusions and subject imports from eight subject countries.179 Moreover, most responding purchasers reported shifting purchases from the domestic industry to subject imports from one or more of the 14 subject countries during the POI, again indicating fungibility between domestically produced aluminum extrusions and subject imports.180 Furthermore, the record indicates that subject imports from each subject country for which data are available overlapped with the domestic like product in terms of alloy series and finish. In 2023, the vast majority of U.S. shipments of domestically produced aluminum extrusions (*** percent) and subject imports (*** percent) consisted of aluminum extrusions made from 6000 series alloys.181 Indeed, over two-thirds of U.S. shipments of domestically produced aluminum extrusions and subject imports consisted of aluminum extrusions made from 6061 or 6063 series alloys that year.182 Only for two sources of subject imports, China at 177 See CR/PR at Tables II-16-18. 178 See CR/PR at Table II-15. The domestic product was usually rated inferior to subject imports with respect to price. See Id. In addition, a plurality of purchasers reported that the delivery time of the domestic product was superior to subject imports from China, and a plurality of purchasers rated the availability of the domestic product as comparable to subject imports from China. See Id. 179 See CR/PR at Table V-11. 180 CR/PR at Table V-16. Of the 55 responding purchasers, 37 reported that, since 2021, they had purchased imported aluminum extrusions from 13 of the 14 subject countries instead of U.S.- produced product. Id. 181 CR/PR at Table IV-9. 182 CR/PR at Table IV-9. 42 *** percent and Ecuador at *** percent, was the percentage of aluminum extrusions produced from 6000 series alloys under *** percent.183 With respect to finish, U.S. producers shipped both anodized/finished and unworked aluminum extrusions in 2023, with most U.S. shipments from U.S. producers being unworked OCR extrusions (*** percent).184 A substantial portion of U.S. shipments of imports from subject sources was also unworked OCR extrusions (*** percent) that year. 185 Anodized/finished aluminum extrusions accounted for over *** percent of the domestic industry’s U.S. shipments and over *** of the U.S. shipments from each subject source.186 Thus, the record indicates that there was a sufficient degree of fungibility between subject imports and the domestic like product for purposes of cumulation. Channels of Distribution. Although the majority of U.S. producers’ shipments were to “other” end users (i.e., other than automotive), they also sold significant quantities to distributors. During the 2021-2023 period, the percentage of the domestic industry’s U.S. shipments going to “other” end users ranged from 64.1 percent to 64.8 percent and the percentage going to distributors ranged from 27.2 percent to 28.3 percent.187 With the exception of subject imports from the UAE, a substantial share of importers’ U.S. shipments of imports from each subject source, ranging from *** percent to *** percent, were made to “other” end users during the 2021-2023 period.188 Responding importers made substantial shares of their U.S. shipments of subject imports from Ecuador, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan, Turkey, and Vietnam to distributors, ranging from *** percent to *** percent during the 2021-2023 period.189 Thus, the domestic like product and subject imports from seven of 14 countries substantially overlapped for shipments to both other end users and distributors.190 183 CR/PR at Table IV-9. 184 CR/PR at Table IV-10. 185 CR/PR at Table IV-10. 186 CR/PR at Table IV-10. 187 CR/PR at Table II-1. 188 CR/PR at Table II-1.

U.S. producers reported selling aluminum extrusions to all regions in the contiguous United States, as did importers of subject merchandise from the 14 subject countries.191 Official import statistics also indicate that imports from each subject country entered the United States through ports located in the East, West, and South regions.192 Imports from each subject source mostly entered in the South and West regions, except for subject imports from China, which primarily entered in the East and West regions, and subject imports from India, which primarily entered in the East region.193 Subject imports from Italy, Turkey, and UAE also entered mostly in the East region.194 Simultaneous Presence in Market. The domestic like product was present in the U.S. market throughout the POI.195 Imports from all subject sources were present in the U.S. market in all 39 months of the POI.196 Conclusion. The record indicates that subject imports from China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UAE, and Vietnam are fungible with domestically produced aluminum extrusions and each other. The record also indicates that imports from each of the subject countries and domestically produced aluminum extrusions were sold in overlapping channels of distribution and geographic markets and were simultaneously present in the U.S. market during the POI. Because there is a reasonable overlap of competition between and among subject imports from China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UAE, and Vietnam and domestically produced aluminum extrusions, we cumulate subject imports from these sources for our analysis of whether there is material injury by reason of subject imports. shipped to automotive end users. See Id. The domestic industry and importers of subject imports from India, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, and Vietnam also made shipments to automotive end users, though such shipments accounted for a smaller share of their total shipments.

Legal Standards In the final phase of antidumping and countervailing duty investigations, the Commission determines whether an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of the imports under investigation.198 In making this determination, the Commission must consider the volume of subject imports, their effect on prices for the domestic like product, and their impact on domestic producers of the domestic like product, but only in the context of U.S. production operations.199 The statute defines “material injury” as “harm which is not inconsequential, immaterial, or unimportant.”200 In assessing whether the domestic industry is materially injured by reason of subject imports, we consider all relevant economic factors that bear on the state of the industry in the United States.201 No single factor is dispositive, and all relevant factors are considered “within the context of the business cycle and conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.”202 Although the statute requires the Commission to determine whether the domestic industry is “materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of” unfairly traded imports,203 it does not define the phrase “by reason of,” indicating that this aspect of the injury 197 Chair Karpel does not join this statement and determines that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of cumulated subject imports.

The Commission “may consider such other economic factors as are relevant to the determination” but shall “identify each {such} factor ... and explain in full its relevance to the determination.” 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(B). 200 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(A). 201 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(C)(iii). 202 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(C)(iii). 203 19 U.S.C. §§ 1671d(b), 1673d(b). 45 analysis is left to the Commission’s reasonable exercise of its discretion.204 In identifying a causal link, if any, between subject imports and material injury to the domestic industry, the Commission examines the facts of record that relate to the significance of the volume and price effects of the subject imports and any impact of those imports on the condition of the domestic industry. This evaluation under the “by reason of” standard must ensure that subject imports are more than a minimal or tangential cause of injury and that there is a sufficient causal, not merely a temporal, nexus between subject imports and material injury.205 In many investigations, there are other economic factors at work, some or all of which may also be having adverse effects on the domestic industry. Such economic factors might include nonsubject imports; changes in technology, demand, or consumer tastes; competition among domestic producers; or management decisions by domestic producers. The legislative history explains that the Commission must examine factors other than subject imports to ensure that it is not attributing injury from other factors to the subject imports, thereby inflating an otherwise tangential cause of injury into one that satisfies the statutory material injury threshold.206 In performing its examination, however, the Commission need not isolate 204 Angus Chemical Co. v. United States, 140 F.3d 1478, 1484-85 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (“{T}he statute does not ‘compel the commissioners’ to employ {a particular methodology}.”), aff’g, 944 F. Supp. 943, 951 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1996). 205 The Federal Circuit, in addressing the causation standard of the statute, observed that “{a}s long as its effects are not merely incidental, tangential, or trivial, the foreign product sold at less than fair value meets the causation requirement.” Nippon Steel Corp. v. USITC, 345 F.3d 1379, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003). This was further ratified in Mittal Steel Point Lisas Ltd. v. United States, 542 F.3d 867, 873 (Fed. Cir. 2008), where the Federal Circuit, quoting Gerald Metals, Inc. v. United States, 132 F.3d 716, 722 (Fed. Cir. 1997), stated that “this court requires evidence in the record ‘to show that the harm occurred “by reason of” the LTFV imports, not by reason of a minimal or tangential contribution to material harm caused by LTFV goods.’” See also Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, 458 F.3d 1345, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Ass’n v. USITC, 266 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2001). 206 SAA at 851-52 (“{T}he Commission must examine other factors to ensure that it is not attributing injury from other sources to the subject imports.”); S. Rep. 96-249 at 75 (1979) (the Commission “will consider information which indicates that harm is caused by factors other than less\u0002than-fair-value imports.”); H.R. Rep. 96-317 at 47 (1979) (“in examining the overall injury being experienced by a domestic industry, the ITC will take into account evidence presented to it which demonstrates that the harm attributed by the petitioner to the subsidized or dumped imports is attributable to such other factors;” those factors include “the volume and prices of nonsubsidized imports or imports sold at fair value, contraction in demand or changes in patterns of consumption, trade restrictive practices of and competition between the foreign and domestic producers, developments in technology and the export performance and productivity of the domestic industry”); accord Mittal Steel, 542 F.3d at 877. 46 the injury caused by other factors from injury caused by unfairly traded imports.207 Nor does the “by reason of” standard require that unfairly traded imports be the “principal” cause of injury or contemplate that injury from unfairly traded imports be weighed against other factors, such as nonsubject imports, which may be contributing to overall injury to an industry.208 It is clear that the existence of injury caused by other factors does not compel a negative determination.209 Assessment of whether material injury to the domestic industry is “by reason of” subject imports “does not require the Commission to address the causation issue in any particular way” as long as “the injury to the domestic industry can reasonably be attributed to the subject imports.”210 The Commission ensures that it has “evidence in the record” to “show that the harm occurred ‘by reason of’ the LTFV imports,” and that it is “not attributing injury from other 207 SAA at 851-52 (“{T}he Commission need not isolate the injury caused by other factors from injury caused by unfair imports.”); Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Ass’n, 266 F.3d at 1345 (“{T}he Commission need not isolate the injury caused by other factors from injury caused by unfair imports ... .

Conditions of Competition and the Business Cycle The following conditions of competition inform our analysis of whether there is material injury by reason of subject imports. 1. Demand Considerations Aluminum extrusions are used in a wide variety of applications, including building and construction (e.g., windows, door railings, curtain walls, highway and bridge construction), transportation (e.g., automotive and electric vehicles, aircraft, rail, recreation vehicles, aerospace, marine, and other mass transit vehicles), renewable energy projects (e.g., solar module frames, racking systems, and structural fasteners), and engineered production applications (e.g., air conditioners, appliances, lighting, furniture, refrigeration, medical and laboratory equipment, and display structures).215 Aluminum extrusions are extensively used in residential and non-residential construction and automobile production, but because of the wide variety of applications for aluminum extrusions, a variety of industries influence 211 Mittal Steel, 542 F.3d at 873 (quoting from Gerald Metals, 132 F.3d at 722), 877-79. We note that one relevant “other factor” may involve the presence of significant volumes of price-competitive nonsubject imports in the U.S. market, particularly when a commodity product is at issue. In appropriate cases, the Commission collects information regarding nonsubject imports and producers in nonsubject countries in order to conduct its analysis. 212 Nucor Corp. v. United States, 414 F.3d 1331, 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2005); see also Mittal Steel, 542 F.3d at 879 (“Bratsk did not read into the antidumping statute a Procrustean formula for determining whether a domestic injury was ‘by reason’ of subject imports.”). 213 We provide in our discussion below a full analysis of other factors alleged to have caused any material injury experienced by the domestic industry. 214 Mittal Steel, 542 F.3d at 873; Nippon Steel Corp., 458 F.3d at 1350, citing U.S. Steel Group, 96 F.3d at 1357; S.

New housing starts, an indicator of residential construction demand, declined irregularly by 4.3 percent from January 2021 to December 2023, initially increasing from January 2021 to March 2022, and then decreasing after April 2022 through December 2023.221 Non-residential construction spending increased steadily during the POI, suggesting increased demand for aluminum extrusions.222 Domestic automobile production generally decreased from 2021 to 2023, due in part to a global semiconductor chip shortage that began in September 2021.223 Responding domestic producers and purchasers generally reported declining demand during the POI, while responding importers views were mixed. 224 Domestic producers generally reported increased demand from 2021 and 2022, followed by a decrease from 2023 to 2024.225 Purchasers generally reported declining demand during the POI, especially from 2022 to the end of the POI.226 On the other hand, most importers reported increased demand since the 216 CR/PR at II-19. 217 CR/PR at II-17. 218 CR/PR at II-18. 219 CR/PR at II-18. 220 CR/PR at II-25 to II-26. 221 CR/PR at II-19, Figure II-2. 222 CR/PR at II-22; CR/PR at Figure II-3.

Supply Considerations The domestic industry was the largest source of supply to the U.S. market during the POI, and its share of apparent U.S. consumption decreased over the three full years of the period.231 The domestic industry’s share of apparent U.S. consumption decreased from *** percent in 2021 to *** in 2022 and *** percent in 2023, for an overall decrease of *** percentage points between 2021 and 2023.232 Its market share was *** percent in interim 2024, as compared with *** percent in interim 2023.233 The domestic industry reported several plant openings and upgrades of existing facilities to add capacity during the POI. In 2021, domestic producers Dajcor Aluminum and Western Extrusions began operations at new facilities, Alexandria Industries completed installation of a new extrusion press line, and APEL Extrusions and Aluminum Insights each announced plans to open new production facilities.234 In 2022, Bunting announced it would open a production 227 CR/PR at II-25; Table II-8. 228 Hearing Tr. at 28 (Peisch), 43-44 (Dillett), 173-74 (Colonna) (testifying that demand increased post-COVID until 2022, but that demand declined in 2023), 129 (DeFrancesco) (“I think what the witnesses would tell you is that certainly as demand is softening, there’s going to be demand effects”); 208 (Levy) (stating “from 2021 to 2022, there’s no doubt demand soars” but that “to briefly look ahead to 2023, what happens there is demand plummets”). 229 Petitioners’ Prehearing Br. at 105-06; Petitioners’ Posthearing Br., Response to Commission Questions at 41. 230 CR/PR at Table IV-14; Table C-1. 231 CR/PR at Table IV-14. 232 CR/PR at Tables IV-14 and C-1. 233 CR/PR at Tables IV-14 and C-1. 234 CR/PR at Table III-3. 50 facility and Western Extrusions announced the reopening of a previously idled facility.235 That same year, Pries Enterprises completed its expansion to add a new extrusion line, Tri-City Extrusion announced an expansion of its production facility, and Hydro Extrusion announced an expansion to its billet casting facility that it expected to be operation in late-2024.236 Also in 2022, International Extrusions installed new extrusion press and fabrication lines that expanded its production capacity, and Momentum Manufacturing Group began operating a new automated extrusion press that it projected would double its custom aluminum manufacturing production.237 In 2023, Tower Extrusions installed new equipment at its Texas facility that increased its aluminum extrusion productivity.238 There were also plant closures, reductions in production, and layoffs of workers by the domestic industry during the POI. In 2021, Aluminum Shapes, LLC declared bankruptcy and closed its aluminum extrusion facility in New Jersey.239 In 2022, Kaiser Aluminum Corp.’s production was disrupted due to an explosion and fire at its Texas facility.240 That same year, Bonnell and Custom Aluminum each announced layoffs of employees that they attributed to declining sales.241 In 2023, MI Metals reported that it was not utilizing capacity that it had added through a completed expansion plan that it began in 2021, due to lost sales.242 MI Metals also reduced shifts and days of operations at all four of the firm’s aluminum extrusion facilities.243 That same year, Brazeway announced that it idled an extrusion press, reduced shifts, and laid off workers, and Western Extrusions announced layoffs.244 In 2024, Tubelite USA announced that it would close a Michigan aluminum extrusion facility, lay off workers, and transfer existing operations to facilities in other states.245 Also in 2024, Kaiser Aluminum laid off 75 employees ahead of eventual closure of its aluminum extrusion facility in Texas.246 235 CR/PR at Table III-3. 236 CR/PR at Table III-3. 237 CR/PR at Table III-3. 238 CR/PR at Table III-3. 239 CR/PR at Table III-3.

These reasons included insufficient domestic supplier capacity, international shipping availability constraints, labor shortages, demand exceeding capacity, and supply chain issues.260 U.S. purchasers also reported supply constraints in each year of the POI, with 27 of 54 purchasers reporting supply constraints in 2021, 31 of 55 purchasers reporting supply constraints in 2022, nine of 54 purchasers reporting supply constraints in 2023 prior to the 257 CR/PR at II-14.

Substitutability and Other Conditions Based on the record, we find that there is a moderate-to-high degree of substitutability between domestically produced aluminum extrusions and subject imports when made to the same specifications.263 Most responding U.S. producers, U.S. importers, and purchasers reported that subject imports from each source were either “always” or “frequently’ interchangeable with the domestic like product and imports from other subject sources.264 With the exception of pricing, most responding purchasers rated domestically produced aluminum extrusions as comparable to aluminum extrusions imported from each country with respect to 16 factors that influence purchasing decisions.265 266 Most responding purchasers reported that subject and domestic sources always or usually met minimum quality specifications.267 Factors that may limit the substitutability of domestically produced aluminum extrusions and subject imports include purchaser preferences for aluminum extrusions based 261 CR/PR at II-14. 262 Chair Karpel discusses the record evidence regarding supply constraints and their effects in the market in her dissent. 263 See CR/PR at II-27. 264 CR/PR at Tables II-16-II-18. 265 CR/PR at Table II-15.

At least two purchasers listed U.S.-produced aluminum extrusions as inferior compared to subject imports from China, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey UAE, Vietnam in terms of delivery times. Five purchasers listed U.S.-produced aluminum extrusions as inferior to subject imports from Mexico in terms of reliability of supply. Three purchases listed U.S.- produced aluminum extrusions as inferior to subject imports from Taiwan in terms of quality exceeding industry standards. CR/PR at Table II-15 (II-45).

CR/PR at Table II-15. 267 CR/PR at Table II-13. 54 on past performance, brand, origin of products, and advanced processing within specific end\u0002uses.268 We find that price is an important factor in purchasing decisions for aluminum extrusions, but often not the most important factor. 269 Responding purchasers most frequently ranked quality (46 firms) followed by price (37 firms) and availability/supply (17 firms) as among their top three factors in purchasing decisions for aluminum extrusions.270 The majority of purchasers (38 of 55) reported that price was a very important purchasing factor, while sixteen reported price was somewhat important, and one purchaser reported that price was not an important purchasing factor.271 Purchasers most often cited availability, reliability of supply, product consistency, quality meets industry standards, delivery time, availability of grades and price as “very important” in their purchasing decisions.272 In comparing the domestic like product with subject imports, domestic producers, importers, and purchasers disagreed concerning the significance of factors other than price. Most domestic producers reported that factors other than price were never significant in purchasing decisions.273 In contrast, responses of importers and purchasers were more mixed. In most country comparisons, most importers and purchasers reported that factors other than price were always or frequently significant in purchasing decisions. 274 Only two purchasers reported that they always purchase the lowest-priced product, while most, 44 of 54, reported that they usually or sometimes do, and eight reported that they never do.275 Domestic producers reported that *** percent of their commercial U.S. shipments were made-to-order, with lead times averaging *** days.276 The remaining *** percent of their 268 CR/PR at II-28. 269 Chair Karpel does not join this statement and instead finds that price is an important factor in purchasing decisions, among other factors. 270 CR/PR at Table II-10. 271 CR/PR at Table II-11. 272 CR/PR at Table II-11. We also note that, as discussed below, while a majority of purchasers that purchased subject imports instead of U.S.-produced products reported that subject import prices were lower than the prices of the U.S.-produced products, only a minority of these purchasers reported that price was a primary reason for their decision to purchase the imported products, and that reported non-price reasons for purchasing imported products rather than U.S.-produced products included U.S. supply constraints, U.S. producers’ lead times, and quality.

Aluminum extrusions from China subject to the existing orders are excluded from the scope of the investigations. Such imports are classified as nonsubject imports in these investigations and entered the U.S. market in limited quantities during the POI.298 During the POI, subject merchandise from China entering under HTS subheading 7610.90.00 were subject to additional 25 percent ad valorem duties pursuant to section 301 of the Tariff Act of 1974299 (“Section 301”).300 Since February 2020, subject merchandise from China entering under HTS subheadings 7604.10.10, 7604.10.30, 7604.10.50, 7604.21.00, 604.29.10,7604.29.30, 7604.29.50, 7608.10.00, 7608.20.00, 7609.00.00, and 7610.10.00 have been subject to an additional 7.5 percent ad valorem duties pursuant to Section 301.

Id. 312 In the final phase of these investigations, Petitioners argue that the Commission lacks questionnaires from firms importing merchandise entering under non-primary HTS numbers. Petitioners’ Prehearing Brief at 64. In the preliminary phase of these investigations, Petitioners argued the Commission should not consider imports entering under the non-primary HTS categories that importers reported because the data were “distortive.” Petitioners’ Postconference Brief at 16-17 (official import statistics represent the best information to measure subject import volumes). In the final phase of the investigations, the Commission used a combination of official import statistics and questionnaire data for imports entering under the non-primary HTS numbers in order to consider the most comprehensive data possible given the expansive scope definition in these investigations. 313 Chair Karpel also finds that the increase in the volume of cumulated subject imports relative to apparent U.S. consumption was significant. As discussed above, cumulated subject imports as a share of apparent U.S. consumption increased by *** percentage points from *** percent in 2021 to *** percent in 2023 and were *** percentage points higher in interim 2024, at *** percent, than in interim 2023, at *** percent – a level *** percentage points higher than observed at the beginning of the POI in 2021. CR/PR at Tables IV-14 and C-1. 314 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(C)(ii). 60 As discussed in section VI.B.4 above, we find that there is a moderate-to-high degree of substitutability between cumulated subject imports and the domestic like product when made to the same specifications, and that price is an important factor in purchasing decisions for aluminum extrusions, but purchasers sometimes considered one or more other factors, such as quality, availability, and reliability of supply, to be more important. 315 The Commission collected quarterly quantity and f.o.b. pricing data on sales of five pricing products shipped to unrelated U.S. customers during the POI.316 Seventeen U.S. producers and 18 importers provided usable pricing data for sales of the requested products, although not all firms reported pricing for all products for all quarters.317 The pricing data reported by these firms accounted for approximately *** percent of U.S. producers’ U.S. shipments of domestically produced aluminum extrusions, and *** percent of importers’ U.S. shipments of cumulated subject imports, in 2023. 318 Given that aluminum extrusions are 315 See CR/PR at Tables II-10 and II-11. 316 CR/PR at V-7.

Nevertheless, we find these pricing data, carefully developed to ensure apples-to-apples price comparisons as discussed below, probative of the relative prices of domestic and subject aluminum extrusions in the U.S. market, particularly given the absence of published prices or price leaders. 319 Cumulated subject imports undersold the domestic like product in 107 of 274 quarterly comparisons, or 39.1 percent of the time, with underselling margins ranging up to 74.7 percent, and averaging 26.6 percent.320 Cumulated subject imports oversold the domestic like product in the remaining 167 quarterly comparisons, or 60.9 percent of the time, with overselling margins ranging between 0.2 percent and 395.2 percent and averaging 45.3 percent.321 Quarters in which there was underselling accounted for 36.7 percent of total reported subject import sales volume (22.0 million pounds) covered by the Commission’s pricing data during the POI, and quarters in which there was overselling accounted for 63.3 percent of reported total reported subject import sales volume (37.9 million pounds).322 percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Thailand, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Turkey, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from the UAE, and *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Vietnam. CR/PR at Table V-5. 319 Petitioners in their comments on the draft questionnaires argued that the pricing products provide sufficient coverage and data representative of the aluminum extrusions market. Petitioners’ Comments on the Draft Questionnaires (Feb. 2, 2024) at 5. In particular, pricing product data collected in the preliminary phase (like pricing product data collected in the final phase) covered approximately 6 percent of domestic producers’ commercial shipments and 5 percent of importers’ commercial shipments, and Petitioners asserted, “Given the nature of aluminum extrusions and the large variety and volume of products covered by these investigations, this coverage was representative of the market and adequate to convey that ‘subject imports predominantly undersold the domestic product.’” Id. at 5 (quoting Preliminary Determination at 63). Although Petitioners requested collection of purchase cost data to “more comprehensively assess pricing trends,” the Commission did not collect these additional data because, in addition to Petitioners’ assertions that pricing product data were representative of the market, it is unclear the extent to which importers import aluminum extrusions for their own use and the additional burden that would be imposed on importers. Importers had indicated that they found it difficult to respond to the questionnaire in the preliminary phase of the investigations, and they continued to report problems in the final phase. See, e.g., CR/PR at IV-2 n.3 and V-7 n.6. 320 CR/PR at Table V-12 (as revised by Memorandum INV-WW-135). 321 CR/PR at Table V-12. 322 CR/PR at Table V-12. 62 The extent of underselling decreased irregularly during the course of the POI. The share of reported subject import sales in quarters of underselling increased from 37.9 percent in 2021 to 41.7 percent in 2022, but declined to 33.1 percent in 2023, and was 19.2 percent in interim 2024. 323 Thus, the pricing data show predominant overselling by the subject imports that generally increased in terms of reported sales volume over the POI.324 We have also considered lost sales information reported by responding purchasers. Of 55 responding purchasers, 36 reported that, since January 1, 2021, they had purchased or imported aluminum extrusions from subject sources instead of purchasing domestically produced aluminum extrusions. 325 Thirty-one of these purchasers reported that the price of subject imports was lower than the price of the domestically produced product. 326 Eleven of those purchasers reported that price was a primary reason for their decision to obtain aluminum extrusions from the subject countries rather than the domestic like product.327 These purchasers indicated they purchased (or imported) *** short tons of aluminum extrusions from subject sources because of price, 328 equivalent to *** percent of the reported purchases and imports of aluminum extrusions from subject sources over the POI (*** short tons). 329 The record also indicates that one purchaser misreported its purchases of subject 323 See CR/PR at Table V-14 (as revised by Memorandum INV-WW-135). 324 We have also considered the purchase cost data Petitioners have constructed and presented as an exhibit to their posthearing brief.

Derived from CR/PR at Tables V-15 , V-16, and C-1. We also do not find the fact that 31 of 36 purchasers that purchased subject imports instead of the domestic like product indicated that subject imports were priced lower persuasive evidence that subject imports were priced lower during the POI. See CR/PR at V-47. The tally of 31 of 36 purchasers only indicates that 31 purchasers indicated that they made a purchase when subject imports were lower priced, but it does not indicate what fraction of their purchases were lower priced. Moreover, the tally does not account for purchasers’ imports or purchases from multiple subject sources. Only imports from one source may have been lower priced according to the purchaser, yet the tally counts the response as indicating the purchaser reported subject imports are generally lower priced. 63 imports, and as a result, the data indicating a *** percentage point increase in subject import share substantially overstate any change in import share. 330 Petitioners argue that the product pricing data are distorted because importers reported pricing data for sales of products unrelated to the pricing product definitions, omitted data that they had reported in the preliminary phase of the investigations, or reported pricing data at different levels of trade.331 They contend that many importers reported sales prices by backing out the value-added to the aluminum extrusion through its use in the production of an assembled product or kit (i.e., deriving prices), as opposed to reporting the sales price of the simple extrusion used to produce the assembled product or kit.332 We are unpersuaded by Petitioners’ arguments that the pricing data should be disregarded in these investigations. 333 Commission staff confirmed that pricing data do not 330 *** reported purchases of *** short tons of subject merchandise over the POI. CR/PR at Table V-15. These purchases accounted for over half of the total imports and purchases of subject imports during the POI.

U.S. Purchasers’ Questionnaire at II-1b and CR/PR at Table IV-2. It likely inadvertently reported its purchases in units or pounds instead of short tons. Because its purchases are likely vastly overstated, the data underlying the *** percentage point increase in subject import purchases or imports over the POI significantly overstate any increase in imports and purchases of subject merchandise over the POI. 331 Petitioners’ Posthearing Br. at 8; Hearing Tr. 29 (Peisch), 82-83 (DeFrancesco). 332 Petitioners’ Posthearing Br. at 8.

Nos. 701-TA-656 and 731-TA-1533 (Final), USITC Pub. 5218 (Aug. 2021)). In Metal Lockers from China, the Commission used revised pricing products suggested by Petitioners, but even in the final phase, the parties agreed the pricing products were not sufficiently defined, and there was a wide variation in prices that suggested the pricing products were too broadly defined. Id. at 28-29. In these investigations, Petitioners have argued that the pricing products generally provide pricing data representative of the market. Prices for the domestic product and subject imports generally tracked each other during the POI and there was no “unusually wide range of quarterly sales prices” as observed in Metal Lockers from China. Id. See CR/PR at Figures V-3 (as revised), V-5, V-7, and V-9. Petitioners also suggest that the Commission should use pricing data collected in the preliminary phase of the investigations. Petitioners’ Posthearing Br., Response to Commission Questions at 17-18. The Commission has on occasion utilized questionnaire data from the preliminary phase of the investigations, but unlike in the preliminary phase of the investigations, the importers’ questionnaire in the final phase of the investigations instructed importers to include transportation costs to the United States in their reported prices when the U.S. sales are valued on an ex works basis in the country of export. 64 include data for products not matching the pricing products or prices derived from sales of downstream products that contain aluminum extrusions.334 Petitioners also contend that purchasers generally indicated that subject imports are lower‐priced than the domestic like product. We recognize that most responding purchasers reported that subject imports were lower priced, and that domestically produced aluminum extrusions are “inferior” to subject imports with respect to price.335 Nevertheless, we find the pricing data a more instructive measure of relative prices than purchasers’ subjective ratings of relative price levels. While purchaser responses to the question about the comparability of prices provide important purchaser‐specific information about pricing, the pricing product data are based on objective evidence of actual prices paid, and are specific to each quarter of the POI, unlike the question about the comparability of prices. Among other considerations, purchasers’ subjective ratings of relative price levels do not illustrate trends over the POI, and have not been as carefully reviewed by Commission staff to ensure both that they do not reflect assessments of aluminum extrusion products that are outside the scope and that they reflect apples‐to‐apples comparisons of the same type of product. Further, 16 of 28 purchasers indicated that subject imports from Mexico, the largest source of subject merchandise, were generally comparably or higher priced than the domestic like product.336 We have also considered the average unit values (“AUVs”) of U.S. shipments of subject imports and the domestic like product by type, showing that the AUVs of subject import shipments were generally lower than the AUVs of U.S. shipments of the domestic like 334 See CR/PR at V‐6 n.6. Commission staff excluded data provided by several importers and continued to verify that data are correct after the staff report issued. For instance, pricing data were revised in a revision memo issued on October 30, 2024, after an importer contacted the Commission to explain an error in its questionnaire response. See INV‐WW‐135 (Oct. 30, 2024). Data from *** were removed after it explained that it had inadvertently reported data for sales of products that did not meet the pricing product definitions. See ***. Petitioners urge the Commission to retain these data because the timing of the importer’s revision was “highly suspicious.” See Final Comments at 7. Notwithstanding Petitioners’ claims, *** provided a reasonable explanation that it mistakenly believed it was required to report all of its sales under the pricing products that most closely matched its products. In fact, it indicated that the products that it had erroneously reported as sales of pricing product 1 “***.” See ***. 335 See CR/PR at Table II‐15. A majority of purchasers reported that subject imports from China, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the UAE were priced lower than the domestic product. Half of purchasers also indicated that imports from Vietnam are lower priced. See Id. 336 See CR/PR at Table II‐15. 65 product. 337 We attach little weight to these AUV comparisons because they are based on approximations of the value of the aluminum extrusions in annual shipments of window wall units and heat exchangers, and would be influenced by differences in product mix and changes in product mix over time. 338 We have also considered anecdotal evidence of underselling provided by Petitioners, but the evidence does not demonstrate significant underselling or pricing pressure by subject imports. 339 Given the predominant and increasing overselling shown by the pricing data, the *** volume of confirmed lost sales by reason of price, and, as well as the importance most purchasers attach to non-price factors in purchasing decisions, analysis of the lost sales data described above, we find that subject imports did not undersell the domestic like product to a significant degree. 340 337 Domestic producers and importers reported average unit values for their annual shipments of CR extrusions and all other aluminum extrusions, as well as aluminum extrusions embodied in window wall units and heat exchangers.

Int’l Trade 2008) (“AUV data is not dispositive proof of underselling because this data is only reliable if the product mix is constant over time.”). Petitioners also provided emails that purport to demonstrate that domestic producers were told that their prices were above import prices or that the purchasers sourced aluminum extrusions abroad. 339 Petitioners’ Prehearing Br. at 73-74 and Exhibits 19-25. Petitioners’ Exhibit 19, for instance, does not contain contemporaneous communications with purchasers. Exhibit 19 consists of an email from the president of *** in these investigations. Exhibit 20 consists of ***. Exhibit 21 also pertains to a period after the POI and concerns ***. Exhibit 22 consists of ***. The correspondence consists of a request for and provision of a quote. There is no contemporaneous mention of competing price points of subject imports, any pressure on domestic prices, or evidence of lost sales. The description of pricing is contained in a more recent email collecting information for use in these investigations. Exhibit 23 indicates a purchaser switched from a domestic producer to subject imports from Mexico due to lower prices and the domestic producer’s long lead times. Exhibit 24 provides ***. The exhibit fails to identify any pricing pressure that can be reasonably attributed to subject imports. Exhibit 25 consists of communications between representatives of ***. One email indicates that ***. Another email from *** contains a chart showing ***. In sum, the communications attached as exhibits to Petitioners’ Prehearing Brief do not demonstrate a pattern of significant underselling or lost sales that undermines the pricing data and lost sales information collected in these investigations. 340 We also note that since most extrusions are produced to order according to individual customers’ specifications using a large number of different molds, and there are generally not published prices or price leaders, there is not evidence that information relating to pricing is particularly transparent or transmissible in this market. 66 We have also examined price trends during the POI. Between the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2024, U.S. producers’ sales prices for aluminum extrusions increased for all products for which data are available, with the exception of product 2.341 The domestic industry’s sales prices for pricing products 1, 3, 4, and 5 increased from *** to *** percent, depending on the product.342 The sales prices of pricing product 2 decreased by *** percent.343 Sales prices for subject imports of pricing products 1-4 all increased from between *** and *** percent.344 The sales prices of imports from virtually all subject countries for which there are pricing data reflected increases over the POI.345 Only the sales prices of pricing product 4 from Indonesia declined over the POI, decreasing by *** percent.346 Further, only two of 25 responding purchasers indicated that domestic producers had reduced prices during the POI to compete with lower-priced subject imports.347 Based on this evidence, we find that subject imports did not depress domestic producers’ prices to a significant degree. We have also considered whether subject imports prevented price increases which would otherwise have occurred to a significant degree. As noted above, apparent U.S. consumption, by quantity, fluctuated, but declined overall during the POI.348 Nonetheless, pricing data indicate that domestic sales prices increased for four of the five pricing products over the POI.349 Moreover, the increase in the domestic industry’s net sales values between 2021 and 2023 was more than the increase in its unit COGS over the period, causing the domestic industry’s COGS to net sales ratio to decrease by 0.6 percentage points from 88.3 341 CR/PR at Table V-11. 342 CR/PR at Table V-11. 343 CR/PR at Table V-11. 344 CR/PR at Table V-11.

The industry’s unit COGS increased from $4,370 per short ton in 2021 to $5,477 per short ton in 2022, and then fell to $4,979 per short ton in 2023; unit COGS were $4,628 per short ton in interim 2024, compared with $5,097 per short ton in interim 2023. CR/PR at Tables C-1 and VI-1. The industry’s unit net sales values increased from $4,950 per short ton in 2021 to $6,211 per short ton in 2022, and then declined to $5,676 per short ton in 2023; they were $5,373 per short ton in interim 2024, compared with $5,932 per short ton in interim 2023.

From 2021 to 2022, the domestic industry’s unit net sales value increased by $1,267 per short ton (25.5 percent) while its unit COGS increased by $1,107 per short ton (25.3 percent).360 Only in interim 2024 did the domestic industry’s COGS to net sales ratio increase slightly to 86.1 percent, compared to 85.9 percent in interim 2023, as apparent U.S. consumption declined and the industry’s net sales value decreased by more than its unit COGS.361 Even so, the domestic industry’s COGS to net sales ratio was lower in interim 2024 than in 2021. Petitioners argue that the Commission should find significant price suppression because the differential between domestic conversion prices and conversion costs decreased in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2022, based on data from the preliminary phase of the investigations, as subject imports increased.362 We are unpersuaded by this argument. As an initial matter, we decline to rely on data from the preliminary phase of the investigations instead of the more comprehensive data collected in the final phase absent a compelling reason to do so, and Petitioners have not established that the data on the record of the final phase investigations are inaccurate or incomplete.363 We also decline to compare data from the first and second halves of 2022 when the record indicates that demand for aluminum 360 See CR/PR at Table VI-2. 361 See CR/PR at Table VI-2. The domestic industry’s unit COGS and net sales values were $469 per short ton (9.2 percent) and $559 per short ton (9.4 percent) lower, respectively, in interim 2024 than in interim 2023. Id. 362 Petitioners’ Final Comments at 8-9. 363 Thirty-one domestic producers provided data in the final phase of the investigations compared to 29 producers that provided information in the preliminary phase. See CR/PR at III-1 and INV-VV-097 (Nov. 13, 2023) at III-1. Accordingly, the sources of data for the preliminary phase and final phase are different, making the data not suitable for comparison. Petitioners also argue that the Commission should restrict its analysis to other factory costs and direct labor when analyzing the industry’s ability to pass through its costs to purchasers. They argue the ratio of other factory costs and direct labor to net sales values increased from 2021 to 2023. Petitioners’ Final Comments at 8-9. The record indicates that the ratio of other factory costs and direct labor to net sales values decreased from 2021 to 2022 when subject imports increased. The ratio was higher in 2023 when subject imports and apparent U.S. consumption declined. See CR/PR at Table VI-1. These trends do not indicate that subject imports account for the increase in the ratio from 2022 to 2023. Petitioners also did not ask in their comments on the draft questionnaires that the Commission collect information concerning their conversion prices in these investigations. 69 extrusions is seasonal, with demand increasing during warmer months, particularly in the automotive, construction and solar industries.364 Because of the domestic industry’s increasing sales prices and ability to pass through its increased costs to purchasers through higher prices during the POI, including in 2022 when subject imports increased, we find that subject imports did not suppress prices for the domestic like product to a significant degree. We have found that subject imports did not significantly undersell the domestic like product, and neither depressed nor suppressed prices for the domestic like product to a significant degree. We therefore conclude that subject imports did not have significant adverse price effects on the domestic industry during the POI. E. Impact of the Subject Imports365 Section 771(7)(C)(iii) of the Tariff Act provides that examining the impact of subject imports, the Commission “shall evaluate all relevant economic factors which have a bearing on 364 See CR/PR at II-5 and II-18. As a general matter, “partial year data are only probative if compared to the similar segment for the previous calendar year.” Polyvinyl Alcohol from Germany and Japan, Inv. Nos. 731-TA-1015-1016 (Final), USITC Pub. 3604 at 24 (June 2003). In certain instances, the Commission will compare different months of different years such as when by statute the Commission considers pre-petition and post-petition periods for its analysis of critical circumstances, but Petitioners do not identify any compelling reason to use such comparisons in this case. 365 The statute instructs the Commission to consider the “magnitude of the dumping margin” in an antidumping proceeding as part of its consideration of the impact of imports. 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(C)(iii)(V). In its final antidumping duty determination with respect to aluminum extrusions from China, Commerce found dumping margins of 4.25 percent for dozens of Chinese producers/exporters, and a China-wide entity rate of 376.85 percent. CR/PR at Table I-6.

No single factor is dispositive and all relevant factors are considered “within the context of the business cycle and conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.”367 Many of the domestic industry’s indicators declined over the POI. The domestic industry’s production, capacity utilization, sales, and shipments declined overall during the period. These declines, however, reflected the industry’s persistent production constraints in 13.19 percent. Id. at Table I-11. In its final antidumping duty determination with respect to aluminum extrusions from Malaysia, Commerce found dumping margins ranging from of 0.00 percent (de minimis) to 27.51 percent, and an all others rate of 16.51 percent.

Id. at Table I-19. We take into account in our analysis the fact that Commerce has made final findings that subject producers in all subject countries are selling subject imports in the United States at less than fair value. In addition to this consideration, our impact analysis has considered other factors affecting domestic prices. Our analysis of the absence of significant underselling or adverse price effects of subject imports, described in both the price effects discussion and below, is particularly probative to an assessment of the impact of the subject imports. 366 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(C)(iii); see also SAA at 851 and 885 (“In material injury determinations, the Commission considers, in addition to imports, other factors that may be contributing to overall injury. While these factors, in some cases, may account for the injury to the domestic industry, they also may demonstrate that an industry is facing difficulties from a variety of sources and is vulnerable to dumped or subsidized imports.”). 367 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(C)(iii). 71 2021 and 2022 and the decline in apparent U.S. consumption from 2022 to 2023.368 The industry’s financial performance fluctuated over the POI, strengthening when apparent U.S. consumption increased from 2021 to 2022 and weakening when apparent U.S. consumption declined from 2022 to 2023 and in interim 2024 compared to interim 2023. Generally declining apparent U.S. consumption and significant volumes of subject imports did not prevent the domestic industry from increasing its capacity, raising its sales prices for four of five pricing products, and covering its increased costs through higher prices during the POI. The industry increased its practical capacity by 0.7 percent between 2021 and 2023, from 1.80 million short tons in 2021 to 1.81 million short tons in 2022 and to 1.82 million short tons in 2023; it was higher in interim 2024, at 466,443 short tons, compared with interim 2023, at 462,969 short tons.369 The domestic industry’s production quantity decreased by 15.4 percent between 2021 and 2023, decreasing from 1.51 million short tons in 2021 to 1.47 million short tons in 2022 and 1.27 million short tons in 2023; production was lower in interim 2024, at 315,766 short tons, compared with interim 2023, at 338,878 short tons.370 Capacity utilization decreased by 13.4 percentage points between 2021 and 2023, decreasing from 83.5 percent in 2021 to 81.4 percent in 2022 and 70.1 percent in 2023; capacity utilization was lower in interim 2024, at 67.7 percent, compared with interim 2023, at 73.2 percent.371 The domestic industry’s number of production and related workers (“PRWs”) decreased irregularly by 0.9 percent from 2021 to 2023, increasing from 15,205 in 2021 to 16,139 in 2022, and then decreasing to 15,064 in 2023. 372 The number was 5.8 percent lower in interim 2024, at 14,540 PRWs, compared with interim 2023, at 15,430 PRWs.373 Hours worked decreased by 1.2 percent between 2021 and 2023, increasing from 32.7 million hours in 2021 to 35.7 million hours in 2022, before declining to 32.3 million hours in 2023; hours worked were 5.8 percent lower in interim 2024, at 7.9 million hours, compared with interim 2023, at 8.4 million hours.374 Wages paid increased by 3.2 percent between 2021 and 2023, rising from $967.6 million in 2021 to $1.0 billion in 2022, and then declining to $998.1 million in 2023; wages paid were 3.5 percent lower in interim 2024, at $249.8 million, compared with interim 2023, at $258.8 368 See CR/PR at Table C-1. 369 CR/PR at Tables III-5 and C-1. 370 CR/PR at Tables III-5 and C-1. 371 CR/PR at Tables III-5 and C-1. 372 CR/PR at Tables III-19 and C-1. 373 CR/PR at Tables III-19 and C-1. 374 CR/PR at Tables III-19 and C-1. 72 million.375 Productivity (in short tons per thousand hours) decreased between 2021 and 2023, decreasing from 46.0 short tons per thousand hours in 2021 and 41.2 short tons per thousand hours in 2022 to 39.4 short tons per thousand hours in 2023; productivity was lower in interim 2024, at 39.8 short tons per thousand hours, as compared with interim 2023, at 40.3 short tons per thousand hours.376 The domestic industry’s U.S. shipments decreased 15.4 percent from 2021 to 2023, decreasing from 1.42 million short tons in 2021 to 1.40 million short tons in 2022 and 1.20 million short tons in 2023; U.S. shipments were lower in interim 2024, at 301,744 short tons, compared with interim 2023, at 320,807 short tons.377 The industry’s share of apparent U.S. consumption decreased by *** percentage points between 2021 and 2023, decreasing from *** percent in 2021 to *** percent in 2022 and *** percent in 2023.378 The industry’s market share was lower in interim 2024, at *** percent, compared with interim 2023, at *** percent.379 Many of the financial indicators of the domestic industry declined irregularly from 2021 to 2023, reflecting reduced sales and shipments, improving from 2021 to 2022 with increased apparent U.S. consumption before declining with apparent U.S. consumption through the end of the POI. The industry recovered its increased costs by increasing its prices from 2021 to 2023, but declining demand limited its ability to entirely pass through its costs to its customers during interim 2024 when its costs were lower compared to interim 2023. Reflecting its decreased shipments and sales, the industry’s net sales decreased irregularly by 2.4 percent between 2021 and 2023, rising from $7.4 billion in 2021 to $9.1 billion in 2022, and then declining to $7.2 billion in 2023; the industry’s net sales were lower in interim 2024, at $1.7 billion, compared with interim 2023, at $2.0 billion, reflecting the industry’s reduced sales and revenues.380 The domestic industry’s gross profit increased by 2.4 percent between 2021 and 2023, increasing from $868.0 million in 2021 to $1.1 billion in 2022 before declining to $889.1 million in 2023; the industry’s gross profit was lower in interim 2024, at $235.8 million, compared with 375 CR/PR at Tables III-19 and C-1. 376 CR/PR at Tables III-19 and C-1. 377 CR/PR at Tables III-9 and C-1 378 CR/PR at Tables IV-14 and C-1. 379 CR/PR at Tables IV-14 and C-1. 380 CR/PR at Tables VI-1 and C-1. 73 interim 2023, at $284.7 million.381 The industry’s operating income declined irregularly by 10.2 percent from 2021 to 2023, increasing from $452.3 million in 2021 to $614.3 million in 2022 and then declining to $406.0 million in 2023; the domestic industry’s operating income was $116.8 million in interim 2024, compared with $169.1 million in interim 2023.382 The industry’s net income decreased by 16.4 percent from 2021 to 2023, increasing from $415.0 million in 2021 to $581.0 million in 2022 before decreasing to $346.8 million in 2023; the domestic industry’s net income was $110.0 million in interim 2024, compared with $156.8 million in interim 2023.383 The domestic industry’s ratio of operating income to net sales improved from 6.1 percent in 2021 to 6.7 percent in 2022 and then decreased to 5.6 percent in 2023; it was 6.9 percent in interim 2024, compared with 8.4 percent in interim 2023.384 The domestic industry’s net income margin improved from 5.6 percent in 2021 to 6.4 percent in 2022 and then decreased to 4.8 percent in 2023; it was 6.5 percent in interim 2024, compared with 7.7 percent in interim 2023.385 The industry’s net assets increased by 4.6 percent between 2021 and 2023, rising from $3.4 billion in 2021 to $3.6 billion in 2022 and 2023.386 The domestic industry’s return on assets increased from 13.3 percent in 2021 to 17.1 percent in 2022 and then decreased to 11.4 percent in 2023.387 The domestic industry made substantial capital investments during the POI in new plants, expansions, and new equipment.388 The industry’s capital expenditures decreased irregularly by 17.3 percent between 2021 and 2023, increasing from $285.3 million in 2021 to $327.5 million in 2022, and then falling to $235.9 million in 2023; capital expenditures were higher in interim 2024, at $60.7 million, compared with interim 2023, at $52.0 million.389 The domestic industry’s R&D expenses increased by *** percent between 2021 and 2023, increasing from $*** in 2021 to $*** in 2022 and to $*** in 2023; the industry’s R&D expenses were $*** in interim 2024, compared to $*** in interim 2023.390 381 CR/PR at Tables VI-1 and C-1. 382 CR/PR at Tables VI-1 and C-1. 383 CR/PR at Tables VI-1 and C-1. 384 CR/PR at Tables VI-1 and C-1. 385 CR/PR at Tables VI-1 and C-1. 386 CR/PR at Tables VI-1 and C-1. 387 CR/PR at Table VI-4. 388 CR/PR at Table III-3. 389 CR/PR at Tables VI-4 and C-1. 390 CR/PR at Tables VI-4 and C-1. 74 We do not find a causal nexus between cumulated subject imports and declines in the domestic industry’s performance during the POI. The domestic industry’s financial performance improved from 2021 to 2022 even as subject import volume and market share increased, but declined from 2022 to 2023 as subject import volume and market share declined.391 Despite apparent U.S. consumption that declined irregularly by *** percent during the 2021-2023 period, the domestic industry was able to increase its capacity, increase its sales prices for four of five pricing products, and fully recover its increased costs through higher prices, reducing its COGS to net sales ratio, and its ratio of operating income to net sales declined by just 0.5 percentage points despite the *** percent decline in apparent consumption. 392 Although the domestic industry’s financial performance was slightly weaker in the three-month interim period of 2024, compared to interim 2023, as subject import volume and market share increased, the industry’s ratios of operating and net income to net sales remained higher in interim 2024 than in 2021. The absence of any clear correlation between subject imports and the domestic industry’s financial performance is consistent with the pricing data showing predominant overselling by subject imports, as well as the *** volume of confirmed lost sales.393 We find that the increase in cumulated subject import volume and market share from 2021 to 2022 resulted from the domestic industry’s supply constraints as apparent U.S. consumption increased in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.394 Responding domestic producers acknowledged experiencing supply constraints during the period due to labor and 391 See CR/PR at Table C-1. 392 Subject imports increased during 2022 in response to a demand surge after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, coupled with domestic producers experiencing documented supply constraints. CR/PR at II-26. 393 See CR/PR at Table C-1. The trends in the volume and market share of the subject imports do not correlate with an increase in the domestic industry’s COGS to net sales ratio. The volume of subject imports and their market share increased from 2021 to 2022, yet the domestic industry’s COGS to net sales ratio decreased. When the volume of subject imports and their market share decreased from 2022 to 2023, the domestic industry’s COGS to net sales ratio decreased further. In interim 2024, when subject imports were higher both in volume and market share than in interim 2023, the industry’s COGS to net sales ratio was almost unchanged. Id. 394 See Table C-1. 75 raw material shortages.395 A majority of responding domestic producers reported supply constraints in 2021 and nearly half reported such constraints in 2022,396 while increasing numbers of responding purchasers reported supply constraints during this period.397 The record further indicates that the supply constraints significantly affected the ability of the domestic industry to supply the U.S. market, forcing purchasers to turn to subject imports. Four of the five largest producers, ***, which accounted for over *** of the industry’s sales by quantity in 2023, reported supply constraints during 2021 and 2022.398 The largest domestic producer, accounting for over *** of the industry’s sales in 2023, explained that “***.”399 It also indicated that its ***. 400 A majority of domestic producers and purchasers indicated that lead times changed in 2021 and 2022.401 During this same period, responding purchasers reported that domestic producers were unable or unwilling to supply aluminum extrusions, placed them on allocation, or had unacceptable lead times.402 Most large purchasers of domestically produced aluminum 395 In 2021, U.S. producers *** reported facing heightened demand from customers who were over-ordering or requesting historically high volumes as part of post-pandemic recovery efforts. Similarly, U.S. producers *** reported difficulties meeting the massive surge in demand, leading to extended lead times and strategic reviews of customer viability to prioritize long-term commitments. They added that labor shortages and raw material procurement difficulties, particularly aluminum billets and paints, added to these constraints. In 2022, as the COVID-19 pandemic's effects began to subside, U.S. producers *** reported that their supply constraints eased. CR/PR at II-15 and II-16. 396 See CR/PR at Table II-4. 397 See CR/PR at Table II-4. Half of purchasers reported supply constraints in 2021, and more than half of purchasers reported supply constraints in 2022. Id. 398 U.S. Producers’ Questionnaires at IV-18. 399 *** U.S. Producers’ Questionnaires at IV-18. 400 *** U.S. Producer’s Questionnaires at IV-8(b). 401 See CR/PR at Table II-12. Purchasers generally indicated increasing lead times in 2021 and 2022. In 2023, several purchasers indicated that lead times were decreasing. See U.S. Purchasers’ Questionnaires. 402 See Mexican Coalition’s Prehearing Br. at 9-10 (quoting from 12 U.S. purchasers’ questionnaires describing supply constraints). 76 extrusions (***, 403 ***,404 ***,405 ***,406 ***,407 ***,408 ***,409 ***,410 and ***411) reported supply problems. These nine purchasers accounted for over *** of the *** short tons of reported purchases of the domestic like product.412 We have also considered the questionnaire responses from nine purchasers that increased their purchases or imports of subject imports from 2021 to 2022 while at the same time decreasing their purchases from domestic producers. Eight of these nine purchasers reported constrained supply in 2021 and 2022, increasing lead times, or other supply problems. 413 Importers did not report problems with supply constraints or extended lead times to the same extent as the domestic industry. 414 The record therefore shows that the domestic industry’s reduced sales and shipments between 2021 and 2022 resulted from its supply constraints and extended lead times rather than subject imports underselling to gain market share. Pricing data show that subject imports oversold the domestic like product in 55.8 percent of quarterly comparisons in 2022, corresponding to 58.3 percent of reported subject import sales volume.415 As a result of the domestic industry’s inability to supply the market as demand recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, subject imports increased during the first five months of 2022, before irregularly 403 Purchasers’ Questionnaire at III-14 (“***.”). 404 U.S. Purchasers’ Questionnaire at III-14 (reported supply constraints during 2021, 2022, and 2023) (“***.”). 405 Purchasers’ Questionnaire at III-14 (reported supply constraints in 2022) (“***.”). 406 Purchasers’ Questionnaire at III-14 (reported supply constraints in 2021 and 2022) (“***.”). 407 Purchasers’ Questionnaire at III-14 (reported supply constraints 2021 and 2022) (“***.”). 408 Purchasers’ Questionnaire at III-14 (reported supply constraints during 2021 and 2022). 409 Purchasers’ Questionnaire at III-30 (“***.) 410 Purchasers’ Questionnaire at III-14 (indicated supply problems with ***). 411 Purchasers’ Questionnaire at III-14 (reported supply constraints in 2022) (“***.”). 412 See CR/PR at Table V-15 (showing purchasers and volumes purchased). 413 The nine purchasers are ***. Of the nine purchasers, only one ***, did not report supply constraints in 2021 and 2022. See U.S. Purchasers’ Questionnaire at III-14. The other eight purchasers reported supply constraints in 2021 and 2022 as well as supply issues that included extended lead times, supply allocations, declined orders, no acceptance of new customers and specific producer supply problems. See U.S. Purchasers’ Questionnaires (described in Section VI.B.3.). See also Mexican Coalition’s Posthearing Br. at I-9 to I-11, II-25 to II-34, and Attachment 1 (showing purchasers’ purchases of the domestic product and imports by year). 414 Only small minorities of importers reported supply constraints during 2021 (19 versus 68 reporting no supply constraints), 2022 (13 versus 75), or 2023 (6 versus 83 in the pre-petition period). See CR/PR at Table II-4. Likewise, they did not report changing lead times nearly as often as domestic producers did during 2021 and 2022. See CR/PR at Table II-12. 415 See CR/PR at Table V-14 (revised by INV-WW-135). 77 declining back to their 2021 volume levels by the end of the year.416 Yet, despite the increase in subject imports from 2021 to 2022 and consistent with the absence of significant price effects, the domestic industry’s financial performance improved as it passed on its increased costs to purchasers through higher prices.417 From 2022 to 2023, the post-pandemic spike in demand eased and apparent U.S. consumption declined *** percent.418 As a consequence, subject imports declined by *** percent during and the domestic industry’s shipments declined by 14.2 percent over the same period.419 Nonsubject imports only declined by *** percent from 2022 to 2023, however, taking market share from both the domestic industry and cumulated subject imports.420 Thus, from 2022 to 2023, the domestic industry’s reduced sales and shipments resulted from declining apparent U.S. consumption, and its reduced market share resulted from nonsubject imports. Nor do we find a causal nexus between cumulated subject imports and any declines in the domestic industry’s performance in the first three months of 2024 compared to the first three months of 2023. Although cumulated subject import volume and market share were higher in interim 2024 than in interim 2023, the record does not show that the increase was driven by subject import underselling, given that subject imports oversold the domestic like product in 13 of 21 quarterly comparisons corresponding to 80.8 percent of reported subject import sales volume in interim 2024, and given the relative importance of non-price factors in purchasing decisions and the paucity of confirmed lost sales due to price. 421 As discussed in section VI.B.3 above, U.S. importers make a substantial portion (*** percent) of their sales through contracts, and aluminum extrusions are usually made-to-order for specific purchasers, to their exacting specifications.422 Having entered into contracts to purchase subject imports in 2022 due to domestic supply constraints, purchasers would have continued to purchase subject imports pursuant to such contracts and would not have reason to switch suppliers during the duration of the contracts. A purchaser may also be reluctant to switch suppliers when it is 416 See CR/PR at Fig. IV-8. 417 See CR/PR at Tables VI-1 and VI-2. 418 After initially strong demand during the POI, several producers and purchasers reported declining demand in 2023. See CR/PR at II-25 to II-26. 419 See CR/PR at Table C-1. 420 See CR/PR at Table C-1. 421 See CR/PR at Table V-14 (revised by INV-WW-135). 422 CR/PR at Table V-4. Further, 44 of 55 responding purchasers require their suppliers to become certified or qualified. Certification can take up to a year. See CR/PR at II-32. 78 arduous to find and qualify a new supplier. 423 Accordingly, even after the domestic industry’s supply constraints eased, we would not have expected the industry to rapidly regain the market share lost in 2022. Moreover, as during the 2021-2022 period, the increased volume of cumulated subject imports in interim 2024 compared to interim 2023 did not prevent the domestic industry from continuing to recover its costs. The industry’s COGS to net sales ratio in interim 2024 was almost unchanged compared to interim 2023.424 Thus, despite decreased sales volume relative to interim 2023, the industry’s financial performance remained relatively stable in interim 2024 compared to interim 2023. Indeed, the industry’s financial performance in interim 2024, although weaker than in interim 2023, was stronger than in any of the full years of the 2021- 2023 period. We therefore do not find that the increase in subject imports during interim 2024 compared to interim 2023 resulted in material injury to the domestic industry. The record shows that the decline in domestic producers’ output indicators and consequent decline in financial indicators are explained by their supply constraints from 2021 to 2022 and the decline in apparent U.S. consumption from 2022 to 2023. Given this, the absence of significant underselling or adverse price effects, and the lack of any clear correlation between cumulated subject imports and the domestic industry’s performance during the POI, which improved by many measures when subject imports increased from 2021 to 2022, we find that subject imports did not have a significant adverse impact on the domestic industry. Petitioners argue that subject imports led to declines in most of the industry’s trade and financial indicators during the POI. They contend that the domestic industry reported increasing excess capacity during the POI, that many producers did not report supply constraints, and that purchasers reported that domestically produced aluminum extrusions and 423 Hearing Tr. at 259 (Stajich) (“So the ability to switch back and forth and the extreme cost it takes to validate these vehicle components is cost-prohibitive. So, once we have to switch, it's very hard to switch back unless you have a new vehicle program, which the OEMs do every five to seven years.”); Hearing Tr. at 260 (Crandell) (“{Qualification is} not quick, and it requires a lot of engineering support from the supplier, from the manufacturer, and from the end user, in this case, an OEM customer. All those boxes have to be filled before that new supplier can come online, and it takes a matter of time.”). See also Hearing Tr. at 241 (Crandell) (“They're going to maintain and continue our business throughout the life cycle of our programs, which typically are four to seven years. So we didn't return to our domestic supplier. We continued on with our existing relationship and we do to this day. And I believe that a large part of our industry is doing quite the same thing.”). See also Mexican Coalition’s Posthearing Br. at II-40 to II-42. 424 See CR/PR at Tables VI-1 and C-1. The ratio was 86.1 percent in interim 2024 compared to 85.9 percent in interim 2024. Id. 79 subject imports were comparable in terms of availability. They argue that the industry’s production and shipments declined throughout the POI, even after the industry’ supply problems had allegedly been resolved,425 and that inventories of the domestic product and subject merchandise increased during the period.426 We are unpersuaded by these arguments for several reasons. First, the record shows that domestic supply constraints were reported by producers representing at least half of the industry’s sales, and nine large purchasers representing over *** of reported purchases confirmed they experienced problems obtaining domestically produced aluminum extrusions.427 The fact that purchasers rated the domestic product as generally comparable to subject imports with respect to availability and reliability of supply does not undermine the other, more specific evidence on the record pertaining to domestic supply constraints during 2021 and 2022. Notwithstanding the domestic industry’s declining capacity utilization rate, domestic producers reported several expansion projects and new plants during the POI that resulted in an overall increase to their production capacity,428 reflecting their conclusion that additional capacity was needed to serve the U.S. market.429 Second, we have found no clear correlation between cumulated subject imports and any significant declines in the domestic industry’s performance after 2022. Although the domestic industry’s supply issues were largely resolved in 2023, apparent U.S. consumption declined and nonsubject imports increased their market share from 2022 to 2023. Cumulated subject imports, by contrast, declined absolutely and relative to apparent U.S. consumption during the period. As we have found, declining apparent U.S. consumption and nonsubject imports, not cumulated subject imports, accounted for the domestic industry’s reduced shipments and sales from 2022 to 2023. While cumulated subject imports gained market share from the domestic industry in interim 2024 compared to interim 2023, they did so while predominantly overselling the domestic like product and the industry’s financial performance remained stronger in interim 2024 than in any full year of the 2021-2023 period. 425 Petitioners’ Posthearing Br. at 9-11. 426 Final Comments at 10-11. 427 Other purchasers, in addition to the large ones referenced above, also cited supply problems. See CR/PR at Table II-15 to II-16. 428 See CR/PR at Tables III-3 and III-5. 429 See CR/PR at Table III-7. Ten firms reported adding to their capacity. Id. Although *** reported relatively low capacity utilization during 2021 and 2022, they also reported supply constraints. Id.; U.S. Producers’ Questionnaires at IV-18. This suggests that U.S. producers’ reports of available capacity were not indicative of their ability to increase production and serve customers. 80 Finally, with respect to increasing inventories, aluminum extrusions are usually produced to order and not shipped from inventory, so inventories typically consist of aluminum extrusions produced and held for specific customers. 430 The domestic industry’s inventories increased by only 1.1 percent from 2021 to 2023 and were lower in interim 2024 than interim 2023.431 For a product that is produced to order and held in inventory for specific customers, this increase does not support a finding of material injury. For the foregoing reasons, we find that cumulated subject imports did not have a significant adverse impact on the domestic industry. Accordingly, we find that the domestic industry is not materially injured by subject imports from China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UAE, and Vietnam found by Commerce to be sold at LTFV and subsidized by the governments of China, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey. No Threat of Material Injury by Reason of Subject Imports A. Legal Standard Section 771(7)(F) of the Tariff Act directs the Commission to determine whether the U.S. industry is threatened with material injury by reason of the subject imports by analyzing whether “further dumped or subsidized imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of imports would occur unless an order is issued or a suspension agreement is accepted.”432 The Commission may not make such a determination “on the basis of mere conjecture or supposition,” and considers the threat factors “as a whole” in making its determination whether dumped or subsidized imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of subject imports would occur unless an order is issued.433 In making our 430 CR/PR at II-32. See, e.g., Hearing Tr. at 88 (Dillett). 431 CR/PR at Table III-10 and C-1. Domestic producer inventories increased from 60,438 short tons in 2021 to 61,095 short tons in 2023. Id.

They also were 8.8 percent higher in interim 2024 at 26,729 than in interim 2023, at 24,567. Id. As discussed above however, U.S. importers generally do not ship aluminum extrusions from inventory, and the record does not indicate that an inventory “overhang” suppressed prices for the domestic like product from 2021 to 2023 as Petitioners contend.

Cumulation for Threat Under section 771(7)(H) of the Tariff Act, the Commission may “to the extent practicable” cumulatively assess the volume and price effects of subject imports from all countries as to which petitions were filed on the same day if the requirements for cumulation in the material injury context are satisfied.435 Petitioner’s Arguments. Petitioner argues that the Commission should cumulate subject imports from all three sources in its analysis of threat of material injury because the reasonable 434 These factors are as follows: (I) if a countervailable subsidy is involved, such information as may be presented to it by the administering authority as to the nature of the subsidy (particularly as to whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement) and whether imports of the subject merchandise are likely to increase, (II) any existing unused production capacity or imminent, substantial increase in production capacity in the exporting country indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports, (III) a significant rate of increase of the volume or market penetration of imports of the subject merchandise indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports, (IV) whether imports of the subject merchandise are entering at prices that are likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices and are likely to increase demand for further imports, (V) inventories of the subject merchandise, (VI) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products, … (VIII) the actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and (IX) any other demonstrable adverse trends that indicate the probability that there is likely to be material injury by reason of imports (or sale for importation) of the subject merchandise (whether or not it is actually being imported at the time). 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(F)(i). To organize our analysis, we discuss the applicable statutory threat factors using the same volume/price/impact framework that applies to our material injury analysis. Statutory threat factors (I), (II), (III), (V), and (VI) are discussed in the analysis of subject import volume. Statutory threat factor (IV) is discussed in the analysis of subject import price effects. Statutory factors (VIII) and (IX) are discussed in the analysis of impact. Statutory factor (VII) concerning agricultural products is inapplicable to this investigation. 435 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(H). 82 overlap of competition during the POI between and among imports from all the subject countries and the domestic like product is likely to continue. Petitioners also claim that there is no basis to conclude that imports from different subject sources are likely to compete under different conditions of competition in the imminent future.436 Respondents’ Arguments. Tecnoglass argues that the Commission due to their limited fungibility with U.S.-produced aluminum extrusions and limited geographic overlap, the Commission should decline to exercise its discretion to cumulate subject imports from Colombia.437 CEDAL argues that the Commission should decline to exercise its discretion to cumulate subject imports from Ecuador with other subject imports for its threat analysis because subject imports from Ecuador showed different volume trends and market shares during the POI than imports from other subject countries.438 Istanbul Ferrous argues that the Commission should decline to cumulate subject imports from Turkey with imports from other subject countries in its threat analysis, arguing that Commerce calculated low subsidy rates for subject imports from Turkey, Turkish producers are responsive to market conditions and maintained a consistent and low share of apparent U.S. consumption during the POI, and Turkish producers accounted for a small portion of total imports, which decreased during the POI.439 New Age Aluminum argues that the Commission should decline to cumulate subject imports from Malaysia because, unlike other subject imports, they are primarily sold to distributors and displayed distinct volume trends440 The Mexican Coalition argues that the Commission should decline to exercise its discretion to cumulate subject imports from Mexico with imports from other subject countries because they oversold the domestic like product *** than other subject imports; decreased in volume and market share from 2022 to 2023 and between the interim periods, unlike imports from other subject sources; and that Mexican producers are more focused on their home market due to recent trade measures on imports of Chinese-origin aluminum extrusions that will create increased demand for their aluminum extrusions in the Mexican market.441 436 Petitioner’s Prehearing Br. at 102-103. 437 Tecnoglass Prehearing Br. at 2-11. 438 CEDAL Prehearing Br. at 2-5.

We have found that there is a reasonable overlap of competition between subject imports of aluminum extrusions from China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UAE, and Vietnam, and between subject imports from each subject source and the domestic like product. Moreover, there is no information on the record to suggest that the reasonable overlap of competition between and among subject imports and the domestic like product that now exists will not continue into the imminent future. We recognize the potential for some differences in conditions of competition from subject countries but find that they are not significant enough to warrant not cumulating subject imports from any one of the countries. We also observe that there is a moderate-to\u0002high degree of substitutability between subject imports and the domestic like product. For these reasons, we exercise our discretion to cumulate subject imports from China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UAE, and Vietnam for our analysis of whether there is a threat of material injury to the domestic industry. C. Likely Volume of Subject Imports Cumulated subject imports, by volume, decreased by *** percent between 2021 and 2023, but were *** percent higher in interim 2024 compared with interim 2023.442 Cumulated subject imports as a share of apparent U.S. consumption increased from *** percent in 2021 to *** percent in 2022, but declined to *** percent in 2023, for an overall increase of *** percentage points.443 Their market share was *** percentage points higher in interim 2024, at *** percent, than in interim 2023, at *** percent.444 The record indicates that subject imports 442 CR/PR at Tables IV-2 and C-1. Certain aluminum extrusions have been subject to section 301 tariffs since August 2019. Aluminum extrusions were also subject to Section 232 tariffs beginning in March 2018; however, most aluminum extrusions were excluded from Section 232 tariffs in December 2020. CR/PR at II-4. Because both Section 301 and Section 232 tariffs have been in effect throughout the POI, market participants have likely already adjusted to their effects. Most responding producers, importers, and purchasers reported that the Section 301 tariffs did not have an impact or were unaware of the 301 tariffs’ effect on the aluminum extrusion market. CR/PR at II-4. With respect to the Section 232 tariffs, most responding producers reported that the 232 tariffs had impacted the U.S. aluminum extrusion market. In contrast, most responding importers and purchasers reported that the 232 tariffs did not have an impact or that they were unaware of the 232 tariffs’ impact on the aluminum extrusion market. CR/PR at II-5. 443 CR/PR at Tables IV-14 and C-1. 444 CR/PR at Tables IV-14 and C-1. 84 increased absolutely and gained market share from 2021 to 2022 when the domestic industry faced supply constraints.445 When apparent U.S. consumption weakened in 2023, subject imports declined to a greater extent than apparent U.S. consumption and their market share declined.446 Because cumulated subject imports entered in response to domestic producers’ supply problems, their increase from 2021 to 2022 does not indicate that there is a likelihood of a significant increase in cumulated subject imports in the imminent future absent relief.447 We recognize subject imports’ market share was higher in interim 2024, at *** percent, than in interim 2023, at *** percent.448 The increase reflects elevated subject imports during one month, March 2024, when subject imports were higher than in any month since August 2022, and would have been influenced by Commerce’s impending preliminary determinations and possible imposition of provisional measures, as well as the seasonality of demand. 449 We therefore do not find that the increase in subject imports in interim 2024 relative to interim 2023 indicates that substantially increased subject imports are likely. Other record evidence also indicates that no significant increase in subject imports is likely to occur in the imminent future. U.S. importers reported arranging for declining volumes of subject imports in the second quarter of 2024 through the first quarter of 2025.450 Although U.S. importers’ inventories increased during the POI, aluminum extrusions are usually made-to\u0002order as opposed to sold from inventory and inventories are generally produced an held for 445 See CR/PR at Tables IV-1 and C-1. Nonsubject imports gained *** percentage points of market share from subject imports from 2021 to 2023. Id. 446 See CR/PR at Table C-1. 447 The record indicates that subject imports increased during the first half of 2022 in response to unusual market conditions in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic: a demand surge coupled with domestic producers experiencing supply constraints. CR/PR at II-26 and Fig. IV-8. Subject imports were otherwise relatively stable from 2021 to 2023. See CR/PR at Fig. IV-8. 448 CR/PR at Table C-1. 449 See CR/PR at Table IV-13 and Fig. IV-8. Demand for aluminum extrusions is also seasonal which can influence import patterns. This further suggests interim 2024 data should be given less weight than other data, which cover full-year periods. 450 CR/PR at Table VII-15. U.S. importers’ arranged imports of subject merchandise were *** short tons in April-June 2024, *** short tons in July-September 2024, *** short tons in October\u0002December 2024, and *** short tons in January-March 2025. Id. Further, the total of arranged imports for the last three quarters of 2024, *** short tons, combined with the volume of subject imports in the first quarter of 2024, *** short tons, suggests that subject imports in 2024 are likely to decline from their level of *** short tons in 2023. See CR/PR at Table IV-2 and VII-15. 85 specific customers.451 Foreign producers’ inventories accounted for only a small share of subject imports during the POI.452 Foreign producers also project that their inventories will decrease in 2024 and 2025.453 Additional information regarding subject producers lends further support to our finding that there is unlikely to be an imminent increase in subject import volumes.454 Subject producers increased their production capacity and production from 2021 to 2023 and in interim 2024 compared to interim 2023, and project increased capacity and production in 2024 and 2025.455 Subject producers’ cumulated capacity utilization declined from 90.3 percent in 2021 451 See CR/PR at II-32 and Table VII-14. U.S. importers’ inventories increased from 18,110 short tons in 2021, to 26,656 short tons in 2022, and 27,026 short tons in 2023. They were higher in interim 2024, at 26,729 short tons, than in interim 2023, at 24,567 short tons. Id. Inventories as a ratio to subject imports increased from *** percent in 2021 to *** percent in 2022 and *** percent in 2023. Id.

Foreign producers’ production capacity increased from 2.0 million short tons in 2021 to 2.2 million short tons 2022 and 2.3 million short tons in 2023. Subject producers’ production also increased; it was 1.83 million short tons in 2021 and 1.84 million short tons in 2022 and 2023. Id. Subject producers’ capacity was 660,687 short tons in interim 2024, compared to 639,112 short tons in interim 2023. Id. Subject producers project their capacity to increase to 2.4 million short tons in 2024 and 2.6 million short tons in 2025. Production was 469,354 short tons in interim 2024 and 454,338 short tons in interim 2023; production was projected to be 1.9 million short tons in 2024 and 2.1 million short tons in 2025. Id. 86 to 80.6 percent in 2023, and capacity utilization was lower, at 71.0 percent, in interim 2023 and interim 2024.456 These increases in production and capacity did not result in a significant increase in subject imports during the POI, however.457 Although subject producers reported a 41.4 percent increase in their excess capacity from 2022 to 2023, this additional excess capacity was accompanied by a 10.9 percent decline in their exports to the United States over the period.458 Excess capacity is projected to increase in 2024 before decreasing in 2025.459 Because virtually all of the subject producers’ production consists of subject merchandise, their ability to shift production from out-of-scope products to the subject merchandise is limited.460 Although the subject producers are export oriented, they made the vast majority of their shipments to home market customers and the share of their total shipments exported to the United States fluctuated within a narrow band during the POI and is projected to decline.461 The subject foreign industries’ exports to the United States increased irregularly from 2021 to 2023 both in absolute terms and as a share of their total shipments, but were lower in interim 2024 than in interim 2023, or 2021, and are projected to remain below the levels of the 2021- 2023 period in 2024 and 2025.462 The foreign industries’ total exports increased from 2021 to 456 CR/PR at Table VII-9. Subject producers projected increases in capacity utilization rates to 79.8 percent in 2024 and 82.0 percent in 2025. Id. 457 As noted, subject imports generally declined from mid-2022 until early 2023. See CR/PR at Fig. IV-8. 458 See CR/PR at Tables IV-2 and VII-9. The foreign producers’ excess capacity was 313,487 short tons in 2022 and 443,178 short tons in 2023, equivalent to *** percent of apparent U.S. consumption that year. Id. Yet, the subject producers’ exports to the United States declined 10.9 percent from 2022 to 2023. Id. 459 Excess capacity is projected to increase to 490,881 short tons in 2024 and decrease to 459,863 short tons in 2025. See CR/PR at Table IV-14 and VII-9. Given the other factors we have considered, including the downward trend in subject import volumes we do not find that this excess capacity indicates that substantially increased subject imports are likely in the imminent future. 460 See CR/PR at Table VII-11. The predominant share of overall production was accounted for by aluminum extrusions. Out-of-scope products accounted for between *** percent and *** percent of the foreign industries’ total production during the POI.

In January 2020, Canada continued antidumping and countervailing duty orders on certain aluminum extrusions from China that were initially imposed in 2009. In March 2021, the European Union imposed antidumping duties between 21.2 percent and 32.1 percent on aluminum extrusions from China. In December 2022, the United Kingdom imposed antidumping duties up to 35.1 percent on aluminum extrusions from China. In October 2022, Australia continued antidumping and countervailing duty orders on aluminum extrusions from China that were initially imposed in 2010. Australia also imposed anti-dumping duties on aluminum extrusions “as-extruded” (i.e., mill finish) or with surface finishes from Malaysia in June 2021. In April 2024, Mexico imposed temporary duty increases ranging from 5 percent to 50 percent ad valorem on 544 HS classifications, effective for two years from April 23, 2024, through April 23, 2026, “to provide certainty and fair market conditions to sectors of the national industry that face situations of vulnerability, derived from practices that alter and affect international trade, and thus promote the development of the national industry and support the domestic market.” The increased duties are 25 percent or 30 percent on extruded aluminum bars, rods, profiles, tubes and pipes, and fittings, originating in countries that are not otherwise free trade agreement (“FTA”) partners with Mexico. Id. 88 result in increased subject import volume from 2021 to 2023.466 Furthermore, Mexico’s imposition of duties on certain imports of aluminum extrusions from countries that do not have an FTA with Mexico in April 2024, for a period of two years, would advantage subject Mexican producers in their home market, making them less likely to direct exports to the United States.467 Mexico was the largest single source of subject imports during the POI.468 466 See CR/PR at VII-47. 467 See CR/PR at VII-47 to VII-48.

Commerce found the following five subsidy programs in Turkey to be countervailable: (1) Regional Investment Incentive Scheme (RIIS); (2) Rediscount Program; (3) Exemption of Exchange Tax for Foreign Exchange Transactions; (4) Deductions from Taxable Income for Export Revenue; and (5) Support for Opening Branches, Trademark Registration and Promotional Activities Abroad. Department of Commerce Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Affirmative Determination of the Countervailing Duty Investigation of Aluminum Extrusions from the Republic of Türkiye from Scot Fullerton to Abdelali Elouaradia, Sep. 26, 2024. Although Commerce did not characterize any of these programs as export subsidies, the descriptions of the third, fourth, and fifth programs in Turkey suggest that they might be export subsidies. Nonetheless, as none of these subsidies resulted in increased subject import volumes from the four countries from 2021 to 2023, CR/PR at IV-2, we find that the record does not otherwise support that they will likely result in increased subject imports in the imminent future. 89 In light of the foregoing, including the decline in subject import volume over much of the POI, the modest volume of arranged imports, subject producers’ stable exports and large home market shipments, and the subject producers’ limited ability to shift their production from other products to subject merchandise or use inventories to increase exports to the United States, we do not find a likelihood of substantially increased cumulated subject imports in the imminent future.469 D. Likely Price Effects of Subject Imports As explained in section VI.D above, pricing data indicate that there was predominant overselling by cumulated subject imports that increased over the POI.470 We further found that domestic sales prices generally increased over the POI and that subject imports did not depress domestic prices to a significant degree.471 We found that the domestic industry had been able to pass through its increased costs to purchasers notwithstanding weak market conditions. We also observed that although the subject imports’ market share was higher in interim 2024 than in interim 2023, the industry’s COGS to net sales ratio was almost unchanged. We therefore found that subject imports did not suppress prices for the domestic like product to a significant degree. We concluded that cumulated subject imports did not have significant adverse price effects on the domestic industry during the POI. Given our finding that cumulated subject import volumes are not likely to increase significantly in the imminent future, the absence of significant underselling or adverse price effects during the POI, the fact that subject imports increasingly oversold the domestic like product over the POI (with underselling declining to just 19.2 percent by volume in the interim period), and the absence of any evidence that subject import pricing patterns are likely to change significantly in the imminent future, we further find that the lack of significant underselling and price effects observed during the POI will likely continue in the imminent future. 469 We recognize that the subject industries have increased their production and capacity and project further increases. These trends did not result in increased exports to the United States except in 2022 when U.S. market conditions led purchasers to turn to imports. The record does not indicate that such circumstances are likely to recur in the imminent future. 470 CR/PR at Tables V-16-V-18. 471 CR/PR at Figs. V-3-V-10. 90 Accordingly, we find that cumulated subject imports are unlikely to enter at prices that would be likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices or are likely to increase demand for such imports. E. Likely Impact of Subject Imports As discussed in section VI.E above, the domestic industry’s declines in production and shipments, which resulted in some declines in financial performance, stemmed from supply constraints, declines in apparent U.S. consumption, and increased nonsubject import market share, rather than subject import competition. Subject imports declined absolutely and as a share of apparent U.S. consumption from 2022 to 2023 as the domestic industry’s supply issues resolved.472 Subject imports increasingly oversold the domestic like product throughout the POI and had no significant adverse price effects on the domestic industry. The domestic industry’s financial performance improved from 2021 to 2022 when cumulated subject imports increased. Although the domestic industry’s trade indicators declined during the period, the declines resulted from supply constraints in 2021 and 2022 and declining apparent U.S. consumption and increased nonsubject import market share from 2022 to 2023.473 Over the interim periods, despite an increase in cumulated subject import volume and market share, the domestic industry COGS to net sales ratio increased only slightly, and the domestic industry’s financial performance in interim 2024 was stronger than during any full year of the POI, though slightly weaker than in interim 2023.474 Thus, the record indicates that any declines in the domestic industry’s performance during the POI resulted from factors other than cumulated subject imports. Petitioners argue that the domestic industry is highly vulnerable to the threat of additional material injury from subject imports because the industry lost market share despite efforts to meet demand by increasing its capacity, production, and employment.475 The record is mixed as to the vulnerability of the domestic industry. On the one hand, its operating and net margins in interim 2024 are better than at the beginning of the POI, and the industry is increasing its investments. On the other hand, its capacity utilization has declined significantly. On balance, we conclude that the industry is not vulnerable. 472 See CR/PR at Tables IV-14 and C-1. 473 CR/PR at Table C-1. 474 CR/PR at Table C-1. 475 Petitioners’ Prehearing Br. at 103-04. 91 The industry’s reduced sales and shipments resulted from supply constraints, declining demand, and increased nonsubject import market share. While demand conditions may remain weak in 2024 and 2025, the domestic industry was profitable in 2023, despite the *** percent decline in apparent U.S. consumption from 2022 to 2023. The industry was more profitable in interim 2024 than in any full year of the POI notwithstanding the poor demand conditions in 2024 described in ***. 476 When cumulated subject imports increased during the POI, they were not injurious. There is no evidence of any change in conditions of competition that would cause cumulated subject imports to become injurious in the imminent future. As noted, much of the domestic industry’s declining production and shipments resulted not from cumulated subject imports, but from supply constraints that have resolved and falling demand for aluminum extrusions. Given our findings that cumulated subject imports are unlikely to increase significantly in volume or have significant adverse price effects, we find that cumulated subject imports are not likely to have a significant adverse impact on the domestic industry in the imminent future. Accordingly, we find that subject imports from China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UAE, and Vietnam found by the U.S. Department of Commerce to be sold at LTFV and subsidized by the governments of China, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey do not threaten material injury to an industry in the United States in the imminent future. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, we determine that an industry in the United States is not materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of subject imports of aluminum extrusions from China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UAE, and Vietnam found by the U.S. Department of Commerce to be sold at LTFV and subsidized by the governments of China, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey. 476 Petitioners’ Prehearing Br. 104-106 and Exhibits 15 and 29. 93 Dissenting Views of Chair Amy A. Karpel Based on the record in the final phase of these investigations, I determine that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports of aluminum extrusions from China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), and Vietnam found by the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) to be sold at less than fair value (“LTFV”) and subsidized by the governments of China, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey. Except as otherwise noted, I join sections I.-VI.C. of the Views of the Commission. Price Effects of Subject Imports Section 771(7)(C)(ii) of the Tariff Act provides that, in evaluating the price effects of the subject imports, the Commission shall consider whether (I) there has been significant price underselling by the imported merchandise as compared with the price of domestic like products of the United States, and (II) the effect of imports of such merchandise otherwise depresses prices to a significant degree or prevents price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree.1 As discussed in Section VI.B.3. of the Views of the Commission, I join the Commission in finding that there is a moderate-to-high degree of substitutability between domestically produced aluminum extrusions and subject imports, and I separately find that price is, among others, an important factor in purchasing decisions for aluminum extrusions. Based on these findings and the following, I further find that cumulated subject imports undersold the domestic like product to a significant degree during the period of investigation (“POI”), causing the domestic industry to lose market share to cumulated subject imports, which gained *** percentage points of market share at the expense of the domestic industry during the 2021- 2023 period and were up a further *** percentage points of market share at the expense of the domestic industry across interim periods. 2 1 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(C)(ii). 2 See CR/PR at Tables IV-14, C-1. 94 I have examined multiple sources of data in evaluating whether cumulated subject imports undersold the domestic like product to a significant degree during the POI, including quarterly pricing data, information concerning lost sales, information provided by purchasers in their questionnaire responses, product-specific average unit value (“AUV”) data, and the sworn testimony of hearing witnesses and supplemental information provided to the Commission by interested parties in their prehearing and posthearing briefs to the Commission. On balance, the record in my view generally reflects that cumulated subject imports were priced below the domestic like production during the POI. The Commission collected quarterly pricing data for the total quantity and f.o.b. value of four products shipped by U.S. producers and U.S. importers to unrelated customers from January 2021 through March 2024. Seventeen U.S. producers and 18 importers provided usable pricing data for sales of the requested products, although not all firms reported pricing for all products for all quarters.3 Pricing data reported by these firms accounted for approximately *** percent of U.S. producers’ U.S. commercial shipments in 2023 and *** percent of subject importers’ commercial shipments that year.4 These pricing data indicate that prices for cumulated subject imports were below those for domestic product in 107 of 274 quarterly comparisons, covering 22.0 million pounds of product, at margins of underselling ranging between 0.0 percent and 74.7 and averaging 26.6 percent, and were above those for domestic product in the remaining 167 quarterly comparisons, covering 37.9 million pounds of product, at margins of overselling ranging between 0.2 percent and 395.2 percent and averaging 45.3 percent.5 3 CR/PR at V-7. 4 CR/PR at Table V-5 (as revised by Memorandum INV-WW-135). Pricing data accounted for *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Mexico in 2023, and subject imports from Mexico accounted for over half of commercial U.S. shipments of cumulated subject imports during the POI. Id. Pricing data coverage varied substantially among other subject countries. Pricing data for 2023 represented *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from China that year, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Colombia, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Ecuador, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from India, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Italy, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Malaysia, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Mexico, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from South Korea, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Taiwan, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Thailand, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Turkey, *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from the UAE, and *** percent of commercial U.S. shipments of subject imports from Vietnam. Id. 5 CR/PR at Table V-12 (as revised by Memorandum INV-WW-135). 95 The Commission also collected purchaser responses to lost sales and lost revenue allegations, where responding purchasers reported purchasing approximately *** short tons of product from January 2021 through March 2024, accounting for approximately *** percent of total apparent U.S. consumption during the POI.6 Of 55 responding purchasers, 36 reported that they purchased subject imports instead of domestic product.7 Thirty-one of these 36 purchasers also reported that prices for subject imports were lower than prices for domestic product, accounting for *** of the quantity of purchases reported by these 36 firms.8 9 The record also includes the responses of purchasers when asked to compare domestic product with subjects imports from each subject country by purchasing factor. In all 14 comparisons, majorities or pluralities of responding purchasers reported that U.S-produced product was inferior to subject imports with respect to price.10 As discussed previously in 6 Calculated from CR/PR at Tables IV-14, V-15, C-1. Total apparent U.S. consumption over the POI was approximately *** short tons. Id. at Tables V-14, C-1. 7 CR/PR at Table V-17. 8 See CR/PR at Table V-17; Petitioners’ Posthearing Br. at Exhibit 39. Petitioners calculate that the quantity of purchases from firms reporting that cumulated subject imports were priced below domestically produced aluminum extrusions was *** short tons, whereas the quantity of purchases from firms reporting that cumulated subject imports were not priced below domestically produced aluminum extrusions was ***. Petitioners’ Posthearing Br. at Exhibit 39. Calculations derived from the staff report are similar, showing that the quantity of purchases from firms reporting that cumulated subject imports were priced below domestically produced aluminum extrusions amount to *** short tons, or approximately *** percent of the total quantity of purchases from the 36 firms that reported purchasing subject imports instead of domestic product. Derived from CR/PR at Table V-17. Total reported purchases and imports of aluminum extrusions from subject sources over the POI by responding purchasers was approximately *** short tons. Id. 9 Of the 31 purchasers that reported purchasing subject imports instead of domestic product and that subject imports were priced lower, 11 purchasers reported that price was a primary reason for the decision to do so. CR/PR at Tables V-17. Reported purchases by these purchasers of lower-priced subject imports due to price covered *** short tons of product, equivalent to *** percent of the reported purchases and imports of aluminum extrusions from subject sources over the POI by responding purchasers. Id. I acknowledge that this is a relatively low figure. However, in a market where price is an important factor in purchasing decisions and product is generally comparable across purchasing factors regardless of source, sustained low pricing by subject imports may affect purchaser decisions even where a purchaser may not identify price as the primary reason to purchase subject imports instead of domestic product. Here, the share of responding purchasers’ reported purchases of domestic product was down *** percent, while the share of responding purchasers’ reported purchases and imports of subject imports was up *** percent. Id. at Table V-15. 10 CR/PR at Table II-15. Majorities of responding purchasers reported that U.S-produced product was inferior with respect to price when compared to subject imports from nine subject countries, (Continued...) 96 Section VI.B.3. of the Views of the Commission, among the most often cited top three factors that purchasers reported considering in their purchasing decisions, price was the second most often cited purchasing factor (37 firms), behind quality (46 firms) and substantially before availability/supply (17 firms), and price was the second most frequently cited first-most important purchasing factor (10 firms), behind quality (18 firms).11 The Commission also collected additional information on the AUVs of U.S. producers’ shipments of domestic product and U.S. importers’ shipments of subject imports during the POI by product type, where product types were defined for crash-relevant extrusions, extrusions for window wall units, extrusions for heat exchangers, and all other extrusions. These data, which cover all U.S. shipments reported by U.S. producers and U.S. importers, indicate that the AUVs of U.S. importers’ shipments of subject imports throughout the POI by and large were lower than the AUVs of U.S. producers’ shipments of the domestic like product.12 AUVs for the four product types were calculated for each full calendar year of the POI and for the two interim periods, for a total of 20 instances where subject import AUVs and domestic product AUVs can be compared. 13 The AUVs of U.S. importers’ shipments of subject imports were below the AUVs of U.S. producers’ shipments of domestically produced aluminum extrusions in 17 of 20 instances.14 Finally, I also note the Commission that has received the sworn testimony of multiple hearing witnesses and other testimonial evidence provided by U.S. producers reporting that subject imports were priced below their product during the POI.15 This evidence, although specifically, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the UAE. Id. Responses were unanimous with respect to subject imports from Colombia and Italy. Id. Pluralities of responding purchasers reported that U.S-produced product was inferior with respect to price when compared to subject imports from five subject countries, specifically, India, Mexico, South Korea, Turkey, and Vietnam.

Despite this recovery in demand, we faced significant price pressure and saw our sales and margins erode due to low-priced import competition.

We were forced to either slash prices to maintain volume or concede (Continued...) 97 anecdotal, is consistent with the foregoing. I consider that the weight of the available record reflects that cumulated subject imports generally undersold the domestic like product during the POI. With the exception of the quarterly price comparisons, which nonetheless show underselling by cumulated subject imports in over a third of the quarterly comparisons and of the reported sales quantity, all other record evidence indicates that cumulated subject imports were predominantly priced below domestic product during the POI. As reviewed above, when asked to compare aluminum extrusions produced in the United States to imported product from each subject country, majorities or pluralities of responding purchasers reported that U.S.-produced aluminum extrusions were inferior to (i.e., higher-priced than) subject imports when compared to all 14 subject countries;16 the overwhelming majority of purchasers that reported purchasing subject imports instead of domestic product also reported that subject imports were priced below domestically produced aluminum extrusions; 17 and product-specific AUV data indicate that the AUVs of U.S. importers’ shipments of subject imports were lower than the AUVs of U.S. producers’ shipments of domestic product in the vast majority of comparisons. 18 On the whole, these data, reinforced by sworn testimony of multiple hearing witnesses and other testimonial evidence, in my view support a finding that that cumulated subject imports undersold the domestic like product to a significant degree during the POI. Quarterly price comparisons, which are calculated using pricing product data collected by the Commission, generally provide for a reliable, apples-to-apples comparison of domestic product and subject imports and therefore also provide the foundation of the Commission’s volume to try to maintain profitability. While we were able to maintain some orders, in many cases, we cannot justify lowering our prices to the level of underselling that is occurring.

We offer a five-day delivery to them out of inventory, and we share business, and that is only because of such a drastic difference in price. We also have the same story with a decking company. We supply a significant amount of deck material from inventory in a three-day delivery turn, and that business is very seasonal, so we build up a large amount of inventory. But they also buy from Vietnam, and that price is similar.

However, notwithstanding the best efforts of Commission staff and of firms responding to the Commission’s questionnaires, this is not always so. 19 Here, two considerations in my view counsel against elevating the probative value of the quarterly price comparisons over the remaining weight of the record in assessing whether subject imports significantly undersold the domestic like product during the POI. First, as discussed above, the pricing data reported by responding U.S. producers and importers provide relatively limited coverage of the U.S. market during the POI, accounting for only approximately *** percent of U.S. producers’ U.S. commercial shipments in 2023 and *** percent of subject importers’ commercial shipments that year. 20 Although these coverage figures are not atypical for an investigation with a broad scope covering a continuum of products, nevertheless, I take into account the relatively limited view of the U.S. market provided by the quarterly price comparisons as a result when evaluating these data and weighing them against the balance of the record, which generally indicates that cumulated subject imports were priced below the domestic like product throughout the POI. In contrast to the quarterly price comparisons, the responses of purchasers when asked to compare domestic and subject product with respect to price, while not necessarily reflective of an apples-to\u0002apples price comparisons of subject and domestic product, reflect the overall considered judgment of many dozens of purchasers in a variety of downstream industries operating across the U.S. market during the POI.21 Likewise, although the product-specific AUV data do not 19 E.g., Aluminum Lithographic Printing Plates from China and Japan, Inv.

In total, the Commission received 56 useable questionnaire responses from firms that purchased aluminum extrusions during the POI.

Second, the apparent difficulty on the part of importers in providing complete and accurate data to the Commission in response to the Commission’s questionnaire throughout the proceeding, notwithstanding the laudable efforts of Commission staff throughout these investigations, is notable in my view and counsels caution in elevating the weight given to the pricing data. 23 The scope of these investigations is among the most challenging to have come the continental United States and represented firms in a variety of industries, including agricultural equipment manufacturing, production of audio/video equipment, automotive manufacturing, boat building, building and construction with construction services, commercial and transport use, contract manufacturing and machining, contractor supplies, curtain walls in construction, fencing distribution and installation, funeral services, furniture, glazing and material distribution, heat exchangers manufacturing, home improvement retail, HVAC assemblies and parts, lighting, manufacturing with contracting and fabrication, marine products, recreational vehicles, screen and shades manufacturing, shower doors, solar products and distribution, trailer manufacturing, windows and doors manufacturing.

However, the Federal Circuit repeatedly has declined to hold that the Commission as a general rule may not rely on AUV data. Allegheny Ludlum Corp. v. United States, 287 F.3d 1365, 1373-74 (Fed.

Further, I note that the Commission in prior cases has relied on AUV data, and product-type AUV data, in particular, to reach various findings or to corroborate other record evidence. E.g., Certain Preserved Mushrooms from France, Inv. No. 731-TA\u00021587 (Final) (Jan. 2023), USITC Pub. 5393, at 6 (choosing to rely primarily on U.S. importer questionnaire responses rather than official import statistics because trends in official import statistics AUVs were inconsistent with trends in Commission’s pricing data AUVs); Metal Lockers from China, Inv.

Seventy-three firms out of 110 reported that they confirmed their data was limited only to aluminum extrusions, regardless of it such extrusions entered with other components or not. While many firms provided detailed methodologies and descriptions of their efforts to isolate their data to refer to just aluminum extrusions, several firms reported difficulties with isolating the weight and value of just aluminum extrusions.”). 100 before the Commission and is both unusually broad in coverage and unusually complicated in its terms and exclusions.24 One of the complexities of the scope is that it covers imports of aluminum extrusions themselves as well as aluminum extrusions that are “a part or subassembly of a larger whole,” where a “part or subassembly” is defined as a “unit designed to be attached to, or incorporated with, one or more other unites or components into a larger completed product.”25 This complexity appears to have challenged U.S. importers in correctly reporting pricing data under the enumerated pricing products. This is evidenced by the significant number of claims by the parties regarding alleged errors, omissions, and discrepancies in U.S. importers’ reported pricing data and the exceptional number of revisions fielded by Commission staff.26 Specifically, Commission staff received 144 questionnaire responses from U.S. importers and 54 revised responses, ultimately arriving at 113 useable responses.27 While Commission staff diligently fielded these requests for revision and undertook additional review of U.S. importers’ reported pricing data where discrepancies were apparent, the significant number of revisions, including one that was filed *** before the closing of the investigative record that changed the quarterly price comparisons from showing majority underselling by volume to showing majority overselling by volume,28 raises questions about the reliability of the pricing data and urges caution in elevating the weight given to these data relative to other record evidence showing subject imports generally priced lower than domestic product.29 24 See CR/PR at I‐23 to I‐30; see also Commerce’s Final Scope Issues and Decision Memorandum, EDIS Doc. 835374 (Sept. 26, 2024) (addressing 50 scope issues for which Commerce received comments from interested parties). 25 CR/PR at I‐25. 26 See Petitioners’ Prehearing Br. at Exhibit 18; Petitioners’ Posthearing Br. at Exhibit 1, pp. 1‐20; see also, e.g., Email of ***, *** (***). 27 See CR/PR at Table IV‐1.

CR/PR at V‐7 to V‐8 n.6. U.S. importers that reported pricing data without significantly higher or lower AUVs did not undergo this further review. See id. One such U.S. importer (Continued...) 101 Thus, given the relatively limited coverage provided by the pricing data and the concern that material errors may remain, I accord the balance of the record – purchasers’ responses to the lost sales/lost revenue allegations, purchaser data on price as a purchasing factor when comparing domestic product and subject imports, the product‐specific AUV data, and sworn testimony provided by hearing witnesses and other testimonial evidence provided by U.S. producers – relatively greater weight than I do the quarterly price comparisons. Based on the moderate‐to‐high degree of substitutability between domestically produced aluminum extrusions and subject imports, the importance of price in purchasing decisions, and the totality of the record as discussed above, I find that cumulated subject imports undersold the domestic like product to a significant degree during the POI. I have also considered whether subject imports depressed domestic prices to a significant degree doing the POI. The available pricing data indicate that domestic sales prices over the POI increased for four of the five pricing products and decreased for one pricing product, where end‐to‐end price increased ranged between *** percent and *** percent.30 These increases occurred as apparent U.S. consumption decreased irregularly from 2021 to 2023 and was down slightly across interim periods, 31 and as the domestic industry’s underlying costs increased irregularly and were down across interim periods.32 Two of 25 responding purchasers indicated that domestic producers reduced prices during the POI to compete with lower‐priced subject imports.33 Based on the foregoing, I do not find that subject imports provided unsolicited revised data to the Commission *** before the closing of the record, ***. Email from ***, ***. These revised data materially altered the results of the quarterly price comparisons, reducing the number of quarterly comparisons where prices for cumulated subject imports were below those for domestic product from 112 instances, covering 46.4 million pounds of product, to 107 instances, covering only 22.0 million pounds of product.

Reported price reductions were *** percent and *** percent. Id. 102 depressed domestic prices to a significant degree. I also have considered whether considered whether subject imports prevented price increases which would otherwise have occurred to a significant degree. The domestic industry’s ratio of cost of goods sold (“COGS”) to net sales decreased by 0.6 percentage points between 2021 to 2023, decreasing by 0.1 percentage points from 88.3 percent in 2021 to 88.2 percent in 2021 and by an additional 0.5 percentage points to 87.7 percent in 2023, for an overall decrease of 0.6 percentage points; it was up 0.2 percentage points across interim periods at 86.1 percent in interim 2024 compared to 85.9 percent in interim 2023.34 Demand as measured by apparent U.S. consumption also declined over the POI, initially increasing by *** percent from 2021 to 2022 before decreasing to *** percent from 2022 to 2023, for an overall decline of *** percent.35 Apparent U.S. consumption was down an additional *** percent across interim periods. 36 Based on the foregoing, I do not find that subject imports prevented price increases which otherwise would have occurred to a significant degree. In sum, I find that cumulated subject imports undersold the domestic like product to a significant degree, thereby causing the domestic industry to lose market share to cumulated subject imports, which gained *** percentage points of market share at the expense of the domestic industry during the 2021-2023 period and were up a further *** percentage points of market share at the expense of the domestic industry across interim periods. Therefore, I find that cumulated subject imports had significant price effects.37 Impact of the Subject Imports Section 771(7)(C)(iii) of the Tariff Act provides that examining the impact of subject imports, the Commission “shall evaluate all relevant economic factors which have a bearing on 34 CR/PR at Tables VI-1, C-1.

I also join the Commission in finding that the volume of cumulated subject imports was significant in absolute terms and relative to apparent U.S. consumption and separately find that the increase in the volume of cumulated subject imports relative to apparent U.S. consumption also was significant. Further, I have found that this significant volume of cumulated subject imports undersold the domestic like product to a significant degree and took market share from the domestic industry, as cumulated subject imports gained *** percentage points of market share at the expense of the domestic industry during the 2021-2023 period and were up a further *** percentage points of market share at the expense of the domestic industry across interim periods.55 As a result, the domestic industry’s output and financials indicators were lower than they otherwise would have been but for cumulated subject imports’ market share gain at the direct expense of the domestic industry. Therefore, I find that cumulated subject imports had a significant adverse impact on the domestic industry. The sustained impact of low-priced subject imports’ underselling and the corresponding market share shift from domestically produced aluminum extrusions to cumulated subject imports can be seen in the downward trajectory of key industry indicators over the POI. As U.S. producers lost market share to low-priced cumulated subject imports over the POI, the domestic industry’s production, capacity utilization, U.S. shipments, and sales decreased.56 Although apparent U.S. consumption contracted over the POI, the domestic industry’s output 54 CR/PR at Tables VI-1, C-1. 55 See CR/PR at Tables IV-14, C-1. 56 CR/PR at Tables III-5, III-9, C-1.

Id. at Tables III-5, C-1.

Id. U.S. producers’ U.S. shipments decreased by 1.4 percent from approximately 1.42 million short tons in 2021 to approximately 1.40 million short tons in 2022 and by an additional 14.2 percent, for an overall decrease of 15.4 percent. Id. at Tables III-9, C-1. 107 indicators all declined by a greater extent.57 As the domestic industry’s output indicators declined, so too did its financial indicators, with operating and net income and operating and net sales margins down over the period.58 Further, once apparent U.S. consumption began to stabilize across interim periods, the domestic industry’s production, capacity utilization, U.S. shipments continued to fall, as did its financial indicators, and U.S. producers began reducing their workforce, as cumulated subject imports gained *** points of market share from the domestic industry over the interim period.59 Supply constraints on the part of the domestic industry in my view do not account for the market share shift from the domestic industry to cumulated subject imports during the POI 57 Compare CR/PR at Tables IV-14, C-1, with id. at Tables III-5, III-9, C-1.

Id. 108 to such an extent that the causal nexus is broken.60 Although all market participants reported supply constraints during the POI, including U.S importers, supply constraints reported by U.S. producers decreased markedly as a POI progressed, and the record is far from clear that supply constraints were concentrated in the domestic industry rather than broadly shared between U.S. producers and U.S. importers. Accordingly, as discussed further below, I find that domestic industry supply constraints do not for account for the market share shift from the domestic industry to cumulated subject imports during the POI to such an extent that cumulated subject imports are not a cause of material injury to the domestic industry. Several points regarding the record evidence are noteworthy in my view. First, domestic industry supply constraints decreased consistently and markedly over the POI. 61 By 2023, when cumulated subject imports continued to hold onto the *** percentage points of market share they gained from the domestic industry in 2022 in a market that is predominantly comprised of spot sales, only three U.S. producers reported experiencing supply constraints before filing of the petitions on October 4, 2023. 62 After the filing of the petitions on October 4, 2023, all U.S. producers reported experiencing no supply constraints for the remainder of 2023 and during interim 2024, during which time cumulated subject imports’ market share was up *** percentage points at the domestic industry’s expense. 63 Second, the number of domestic producers that reported experiencing supply constraints during the POI, in particular, during the years when the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were most acute (i.e., 2021 and 2022), was comparable in absolute terms to the 60 See Nippon Steel Corp. v.

Notably, by 2023 and interim 2024, the number of U.S. importers reporting supply constraints exceeded the number of domestic producers reporting supply constraints during this time.66 Third, this view of record is consistent with what purchasers reported to the Commission when asked to compare U.S.-produced aluminum extrusions and imports from each subject country by purchasing factor. Specifically, when asked to compare domestic 64 CR/PR at Table II-4.

With regard to lead times, whereas U.S. producers reported that *** percent of their commercial shipments were produced to order, with lead times averaging *** days and the remaining *** percent of their commercial shipments coming from inventories with lead times averaging *** days, U.S importers reported that *** percent of their commercial shipments were produced-to-order with lead times averaging *** days.69 That is, for over *** of their commercial shipments, U.S. importers reported lead times that were *** those of U.S. producers for the vast majority of their shipments.70 Further, with regard to delivery time as a purchasing factor, as with availability and reliability of supply, when asked to compare domestic product and subject imports based on delivery time, overwhelming majorities of responding purchasers reported that domestic product was superior or comparable to imports from all 14 subject countries. 71 Finally, I also note that the Commission has received the sworn testimony of multiple hearing witnesses and other testimonial evidence provided by U.S. producers reporting that they did not suffer supply constraints during the POI and even supplied orders that U.S. importers were unable to fill.72 This evidence, although anecdotal, is consistent with the 67 Calculated from CR/PR at Table II-15. 68 See CR/PR at Table II-15. 69 CR/PR at II-32. 70 CR/PR at II-32. 71 Calculated from CR/PR at Table II-15. 72 E.g., Hearing Tr. at 90-91 (Mr. Dillett) (“That is simply not true.

We successfully hired people and brought them into our plant, quickly trained them, and we were really aggressive on acquiring new business. Many companies that we had long sought after came to us. But it's the opposite. The foreign import wasn't able to supply, and we were the ones that were aggressively tooling and trying to supply.

We saw the pandemic, you know, everything stopped for a while. We were all wondering what's going on, and then demand suddenly starts building. We start hiring. It's hard to find people. We raise our wages. We increase our capacity, and those customers that I was telling you about that we share with the subject importers, all of a sudden{,} a lot of that{} metal was not able to reach our customers. They got tied up at all those port congestions or all of those other things that we saw. So here come those customers to us wanting to order double or triple the amount that they normally ordered. Some of those customers, we did have to limit them to the amount of extrusions they had purchased in the prior year and usually quite a bit more. But, when they came and tripled their orders, there's no way we could ramp up that fast. So we were trying to cover a lot of these things that they were having. So this goes on, we're ramping up, we get through. We get to the middle of '22 and all of a sudden everything stops and all of a sudden we get order cancellations. So these same customers, if they can buy our extrusions or they've got the other cheap extrusions that are showing up, guess which ones get canceled? We were the ones that got canceled. So that's really the sequence of events that happened through all of that period.”); id. at 92-93 (Mr. Butterfield) (“We had a very similar situation. We were able to maintain shipments at a facility in Leetonia, Ohio. That facility has invested over $20 million in capital to support additional volume.

That can be six weeks or so. That would be {in}curred by anyone. We ramped volume. We were able to supply. We met our shipment requirements. But, since then, what has occurred? Many of the extrusions that are on the table is no longer supplied. These were extrusions that they couldn't get from imports at that time because of the logistic issues they were dealing with. We invested. We brought team members on. We produced it. We produced at a very high quality and met specifications. That now has all left. All 150 people that we brought into that facility are no longer there. That extrusion capacity is now sitting at 50 percent. That fabrication capacity is sitting at 22 percent. In addition to that, those products went to Korea. We could not compete with price. Not only did they go to Korea, they took our technology and they took the OEMs, the type of equipment we were using, to Korea to be able to produce it. That's an example in our Leetonia, Ohio, facility. A very similar situation occurred in our Pennsylvania facilities, where we had invested, we responded, we supported them, and since then, we've lost demand from there.

Accordingly, whereas I find the foregoing witness testimony regarding domestic industry supply constraints generally consistent with the broader record, I find these select purchaser reports out of step with the broader record. 112 between cumulated subject imports and material injury to the domestic industry – specifically, that subject import underselling was a cause of the observed market share shift from the domestic industry to cumulated subject imports during the POI.73 Cumulated subject imports gained *** percentage points of market share at the expense of the domestic industry during the 2021-2023 period and were up a further *** percentage points of market share at the expense of the domestic industry across interim periods, well after the domestic industry’s supply constraints had abated. 74 75 By interim 2024, the domestic industry’s capacity utilization rate had fallen to 67.7 percent – down 15.8 percentage points from its high at the beginning of the POI at 83.5 percent.76 Based on the foregoing, I find that cumulated subject imports had a significant adverse impact on the domestic industry. 73 To the extent that domestic industry supply constraints may explain some portion of market share shift from the domestic industry to cumulated subject imports during the POI, I note that the “by reason of” standard in the statute does not require that unfairly traded imports be the sole or principal cause of injury to the domestic. See Nippon Steel Corp. v. ITC, 345 F.3d at 1381 (“{Subject imports} need not be the sole or principal cause of injury. As long as its effects are not merely incidental, tangential, or trivial, the foreign product sold at less than fair value meets the causation requirement.”). 74 See CR/PR at Tables IV-14, C-1.

Id. at Tables IV-14, C-1. However, in view of the broader record discussed above, this evidence is my view does not support a finding that the causal nexus between subject import pricing and material injury is broken. Further, even to the extent that supply constraints may account for a shift in market share from domestic producers to subject imports from 2021 to 2022, as domestic industry supply constraints maintained their consistent downward trajectory in 2023, the domestic industry did not gain back any of the market share it lost to cumulated subject imports in 2022 notwithstanding the predominance of spot sale transactions in both U.S. producers’ and U.S. importers’ reported commercial shipments.

I-6 Terminology and data for the staff report Subject sources.--This refers to the fourteen sources from the petition that are under ongoing investigation and for which Commerce has found sales at less than fair value or subsidization. For China, this covers only aluminum extrusions not currently covered by the existing AD/CVD orders on China (\"China, not under order(s)\"). For India, this covers imports of aluminum extrusions from all suppliers in India except Maan Aluminum (\"India, subject\"). For Italy, this covers imports of aluminum extrusions from all suppliers in Italy except Eural Gnutti (\"Italy, subject\"). For Malaysia, this covers imports of aluminum extrusions from all suppliers in Malaysia except Genesis and P.A. Extrusion (\"Malaysia, subject\"). For South Korea, this covers imports of aluminum extrusions from all suppliers in South Korea except ALMAC (\"South Korea, subject\"). For Taiwan, this covers imports of aluminum extrusions from all suppliers in Taiwan except Sow Shin (\"Taiwan, subject\").10 For all other sources this covers imports of aluminum extrusions from all suppliers: China not under order(s), Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. 11 12 Nonsubject sources.--This refers to all sources not covered by the \"Subject sources\" category above. The category includes imports of aluminum extrusions currently covered by the existing AD/CVD orders on China, as well as imports of aluminum extrusion from the de minimis or zero rate entities from India, Italy, Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan. (…continued) same statistical reporting numbers listed above was used in certain tables to remove imports reported by firms that certified \"no\" they do not import aluminum extrusions. For detailed information on the adjustments for each table, see specific table source notes. Certain questionnaire additions or revisions following staff outreach may not be present in this report if they were received too late for review. 10 The complete names of these “de minimis or zero rate entities” are as follows: Maan Aluminum Limited of India; Eural Gnutti S.p.A. of Italy; Genesis Aluminium Industries Sdn. Bhd./Zenshin Industries Sdn. Bhd. and P.A. Extrusion (M) Sdn. Bhd. of Malaysia; ALMAC Co., Ltd/ALMAC Korea Co., Ltd./AR Aluminum Co., Ltd of South Korea; and Sow Shin Aluminum Co., Ltd.; Xiashin International Co., Ltd. of Taiwan. 11 The investigation concerning the Dominican Republic, the fifteenth source in the original petition, was terminated following the Commission’s finding that aluminum extrusions from the Dominican Republic that are allegedly sold in the United States at LTFV are negligible. Therefore, imports from the Dominican Republic in this report are nonsubject. 12 For certain sources for which Commerce found de minimis or zero rates in its subsidization determinations but not de minimis or zero rates in its less than fair value determinations, imports from those sources are treated as part of the subject aggregation except in the Commission's negligibility analysis in part IV. I-7 Previous and related investigations Aluminum extrusions have been the subject of one prior countervailing/antidumping duty investigation in the United States.13 On March 31, 2010, petitions were filed with Commerce and the Commission by the Aluminum Extrusions Fair Trade Committee14 and the USW alleging that an industry in the United States was materially injured and threatened with material injury by reason of LTFV and subsidized imports of aluminum extrusions from China. On April 4, 2011, Commerce determined that imports of aluminum extrusions from China were being sold at LTFV and subsidized by the Government of China. The Commission determined on May 13, 2011, that the domestic industry was materially injured by reason of LTFV and subsidized imports of aluminum extrusions other than finished heat sinks from China.15 On May 26, 2011, Commerce issued its antidumping and countervailing duty orders with the final weighted-average dumping margins ranging from 32.79 to 33.28 percent and net subsidy rates ranging from 8.02 to 374.15 percent. On July 5, 2016, the Commission determined that it would conduct full reviews of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on aluminum extrusions from China. On August 5, 2016, Commerce determined that revocation of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on aluminum extrusions from China would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and subsidization. On March 27, 2017, the Commission determined that material injury would be likely to continue or recur within a reasonably foreseeable time. Following affirmative determinations in the five-year reviews by Commerce and the Commission, effective April 25, 2017, Commerce issued a continuation of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on imports of aluminum extrusions from China. On June 6, 2022, the Commission determined that it would conduct expedited reviews of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on aluminum extrusions from China. On July 13 Unless otherwise indicated, information in this section is based on information contained in Aluminum Extrusions from China (Second Review), Inv. Nos 701-TA-475 and 731-TA-1177, USITC Publication 5375, October 2022, pp. I-3– I-4. 14 The original members of the Committee included: Aerolite Extrusion Company; Alexandria Extrusion Company; Benada Aluminum of Florida, Inc.; William L. Bonnell Company, Inc.; Frontier Aluminum Corporation; Futura Industries Corporation; Hydro Aluminum North America, Inc.; Kaiser Aluminum Corporation; Profile Extrusion Company; Sapa Extrusions, Inc.; and Western Extrusions Corporation. 15 The Commission further determined that an industry in the United States was not materially injured or threatened with material injury, or that the establishment of an industry in the United States was not materially retarded, by reason of imports of finished heat sinks from China. 76 FR 29007, May 19, 2011. I-8 7, 2022, Commerce determined that revocation of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on aluminum extrusions from China would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and subsidization.16 On October 17, 2022, the Commission determined that material injury would be likely to continue or recur within a reasonably foreseeable time.17 Following affirmative determinations in the five-year reviews by Commerce and the Commission, effective November 2, 2022, Commerce issued a continuation of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on imports of aluminum extrusions from China.18 In its Issues and Decision Memoranda accompanying the results of its most recent reviews, Commerce noted that there have been over 125 scope rulings since the imposition of the orders.19 Nature and extent of subsidies and sales at LTFV Subsidies On October 3, 2024, Commerce published notices in the Federal Register of its final determinations of countervailable subsidies for producers and exporters of aluminum extrusions from China, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey. 20 Tables I-2 through I-5 present Commerce’s findings of subsidization of aluminum extrusions in China, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey. 16 87 FR 40501, July 7, 2022; 87 FR 40509, July 7, 2022. 17 87 FR 64113, October 21, 2022. 18 87 FR 66128, November 2, 2022. 19 See “Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of the Expedited Second Sunset Review of the Antidumping Duty Order on Aluminum Extrusions from the People’s Republic of China”, June 29, 2022, and “Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of the 2022 Expedited Sunset Review of the Countervailing Duty Order on Aluminum Extrusions from the People’s Republic of China”, June 29, 2022. 20 89 FR 80468, 89 FR 80496, 89 FR 80526, and 89 FR 80536, October 3, 2024.

The country of origin of the aluminum extrusion is determined by where the metal is extruded ( i.e., pressed through a die). 22 See Commerce notices of final affirmative determinations at 89 FR 80452, 89 FR 80458, 89 FR 80463, 89 FR 80472, 89 FR 80477, 89 FR 80482, 89 FR 80487, 89 FR 80492, 89 FR 80501, 89 FR 80506, 89 FR 80512, 89 FR 80517, 89 FR 80521, and 89 FR 80530, October 3, 2024, and at 89 FR 80468, 89 FR 80496, 89 FR 80526, and 89 FR 80536, October 3, 2024. I-24 Aluminum extrusions are produced and imported in a wide variety of shapes and forms, including, but not limited to, hollow profiles, other solid profiles, pipes, tubes, bars, and rods. Aluminum extrusions that are drawn subsequent to extrusion (drawn aluminum) are also included in the scope. Subject aluminum extrusions are produced and imported with a variety of coatings and surface treatments, and types of fabrication. The types of coatings and treatments applied to aluminum extrusions include, but are not limited to, extrusions that are mill finished ( i.e., without any coating or further finishing), brushed, buffed, polished, anodized (including bright dip), liquid painted, electroplated, chromate converted, powder coated, sublimated, wrapped, and/or bead blasted. Subject aluminum extrusions may also be fabricated, i.e., prepared for assembly, or thermally improved. Such operations would include, but are not limited to, extrusions that are cut-to-length, machined, drilled, punched, notched, bent, stretched, stretch-formed, hydroformed, knurled, swedged, mitered, chamfered, threaded, spun, etched, and engraved. Performing such operations in third countries does not otherwise remove the merchandise from the scope of the investigation. The types of products that meet the definition of subject merchandise include but are not limited to, the aluminum extrusion portions of vehicle roof rails and sun/moon roof framing, solar panel racking rails and framing, tradeshow display fixtures and framing, parts for tents or clear span structures, fence posts, drapery rails or rods, electrical conduits, door thresholds, flooring trim, electric vehicle battery trays, heat sinks, signage or advertising poles, telescoping poles, or cleaning system components. Aluminum extrusions may be heat sinks, which are fabricated aluminum extrusions that dissipate heat away from a heat source and may serve other functions, such as structural functions. Heat sinks come in a variety of sizes and shapes, including but not limited to a flat electronic heat sink, which is a solid aluminum extrusion with at least one flat side used to mount electronic or mechanical devices; a heat sink that is a housing for electronic controls or motors; lighting heat sinks, which dissipate heat away from LED devices; and process and exchange heat sinks, which are tube extrusions with fins or plates used to hold radiator tubing. Heat sinks are included in the scope, regardless of whether the design and production of the heat sinks are organized around meeting specified thermal performance requirements and regardless of whether they have been tested to comply with such requirements. For purposes of the investigations on aluminum extrusions from the People's Republic of China, only heat sinks designed and produced around meeting specified I-25 thermal performance requirements and tested to comply with such requirements are included in the scope. Excluded from the scope of the investigation are large, multi-finned extruded aluminum heat sinks designed to dissipate heat, meeting the following criteria: (1) an aspect ratio (defined as the ratio of the area of a void in an extrusion to the size of the smallest gap opening at the entrance of that void and calculated by dividing the void area by the square of the gap opening) greater than 15 to 1; or (2) the circumscribing circle diameter (defined as the diameter of the smallest circle that will entirely enclose the extrusion's cross-sectional profile) rounded up to the next half inch, exceeds 10 inches, and the weight-per-foot (defined as the theoretical weight of the profile as extruded prior to any machining that may remove material and calculated by multiplying the area of the profile in square inches by 1.2) exceeds 3.50 pounds per foot. Merchandise that is comprised solely of aluminum extrusions or aluminum extrusions and fasteners, whether assembled at the time of importation or unassembled, is covered by the scope in its entirety. A fastener is any material or part that serves an attachment function, fastens two or more components, or serves to prevent or restrict movement of a component or another item. Examples of fasteners include, but are not limited to, nuts, bolts, clamps, and end caps. The scope also includes aluminum extrusions contained in merchandise that is a part or subassembly of a larger whole, whether or not the merchandise also contains a component other than aluminum extrusions that is beyond a fastener. Such merchandise may be either assembled or unassembled at the time of importation. A “part or subassembly” is defined as a unit designed to be attached to, or incorporated with, one or more other units or components into a larger completed product. Only the aluminum extrusion portion of the merchandise described in this paragraph, whether assembled or unassembled, is subject merchandise included in the scope and subject to duties. Examples of merchandise that is a part or subassembly of a larger whole include, but are not limited to, window parts or subassemblies; door unit parts or subassemblies; shower and bath parts or subassemblies; solar panel mounting systems; fenestration system parts or subassemblies, such as units which make up a curtain wall, and window walls and window wall units, which collectively make up a fenestration system on the side of a building; and parts or subassemblies of storefronts; furniture parts or subassemblies; appliance parts or subassemblies, such as fin evaporator coils and systems for refrigerators; railing or deck system parts or subassemblies; fence system parts or subassemblies; motor vehicle parts or subassemblies, such as bumpers for motor vehicles; trailer parts or I-26 subassemblies, such as side walls, flooring, and roofings; electric vehicle charging station parts or subassemblies; or signage or advertising system parts or subassemblies.

I-36 The product Description and applications38 Aluminum extrusions are shapes and forms produced via an extrusion process of aluminum alloys having metallic elements falling within the alloy series designations 1, 3, 5, and 6 published by the Aluminum Association (table I-21) or the proprietary or other certifying body equivalents. Alloyed aluminum is a chemical composition with other elements added to pure molten aluminum to enhance its physical properties (table I-21). Aluminum extrusions are produced and imported in a wide variety of shapes and forms, including, but not limited to, pipes and tubes (including hollow profiles), shapes (profiles), and bars and rods (figure I-1).39 Solid profiles can include angles, tees, I-beams, H-beams, channels, window frame and sash components,40 gutters, and other shapes, including fabricated components (e.g., heat sinks).41 Aluminum extrusions also include those that are subsequently drawn (drawn aluminum) or undergo coating or other surface treatments, fabrication (in preparations for assembly), or thermal processes. These post-extrusion processes can occur in third countries, as the country of origin is determined by where the aluminum is extruded (pressed through a die). Subject products can be imported consisting either solely of aluminum extrusions (along with any fasteners), and under certain conditions with other components, as parts or subassemblies of a larger whole, or either assembled or unassembled. However, only the aluminum extrusion portion of such merchandise is included in the scope and subject to duties. 38 Unless otherwise specified, information in this section is derived from Aluminum Extrusions from China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, Inv.

Commerce’s scope excludes merchandise containing extruded aluminum components beyond fasteners, for use in the forms as imported, that are not a part or subassembly of a larger whole (product or system).42 Parts or subassemblies containing aluminum extrusions that are subject in their entirety to existing import-injury orders are excluded from the scope of these investigations. The scope also excludes aluminum alloy sheet or plates produced by methods other than the extrusion process; aluminum products produced by the casting method; unwrought aluminum in any form; certain collapsible tubular containers and rectangular wire as described in the scope language, and “hard alloy” extrusions (within alloy series designations of the Aluminum Association commencing with the numbers 2, 5, and 7 in table I-21) that provide high strength over a wide range of temperatures. Commerce’s revised scope excludes merchandise containing multiple subassemblies of a larger whole with extruded and non-extruded aluminum components beyond fasteners in particular circumstances. Examples of additional exclusions are the following: specific shape and dimensional requirements for excluded heat sinks; fully assembled solar panels and solar modules; precision non-electrically conductive coated buss bars; precision drawn aluminum tubing; and fully assembled glass refrigerator shelves with decorative aluminum trim. Aluminum extrusions are produced for a wide variety of finished goods applications. Major end-use applications for aluminum extrusions, and subassemblies containing aluminum extrusions, include building and construction components, structures, motor vehicles, railway 42 Examples of such larger products or systems include windows with glass, door units with door panels and glass, motor vehicles, trailers, furniture, appliances, and solar panels, among others. I-39 and mass-transit vehicles, aircraft and spacecraft, marine vessels, solar energy panel frames and supports, air conditioners and appliances, consumer and commercial products, and medical and laboratory equipment, among others.43 Nevertheless, despite differences in physical characteristics44 and distinct applications based on sector and specific end-user requirements,45 aluminum extrusions share similar general physical characteristics and a range of tolerances, as they are often inputs (i.e., an intermediate product) in the production of downstream products. Manufacturing processes46 The manufacturing processes generally consists of three distinct stages: (1) melting and refining of primary aluminum or remelting of aluminum scrap, (2) casting molten aluminum into unwrought billets, and (3) extruding aluminum billets into shapes. Melting and refining Aluminum is produced using either the primary electrolytic smelting or the secondary remelting process. Inputs for the primary smelting process are derived from aluminum\u0002containing ore (bauxite) that is mined and refined into aluminum oxide (alumina) through the Bayer chemical refining process.47 The alumina is then electrolytically smelted to remove oxygen and produce molten aluminum metal in the electricity-intensive Hall-Héroult process.48 The molten aluminum can either remain unalloyed or be alloyed with the addition of other metals to enhance certain properties and characteristics. Although the desired characteristics of the final product are generally determined during the melting and refining stages, alloying 43 Petition, p. 12. 44 Physical characteristics of aluminum extrusions include different metal strengths (based on the length of the baking process used), appearances (based on the customer’s preference of finish), cross\u0002sectional shapes (as required by the specific purchaser), and specific fabrications (provided for end users). 45 For example, extrusions for automotive applications may reflect more sophisticated design and composition specifications than commodity-type extrusions used as building and construction materials. 46 Unless otherwise specified, information in this section is derived from Preliminary publication, pp. I-18 – I-21. 47 During the Bayer process, the bauxite is crushed, washed, dried, and dissolved with caustic soda. The mixture is then filtered to remove impurities and then transferred to a precipitator tank where it is chemically reduced into alumina.

I-40 also can occur later in the manufacturing process through a cladding process (described later in this section). Remelting of scrap Alternatively, secondary aluminum is produced by melting and alloying aluminum scrap.49 Most U.S. secondary producers purchase large volumes of aluminum scrap, melt it down, and alloy it with other metals and primary aluminum to adjust the chemical composition. Secondary aluminum producers can adjust the primary aluminum content depending on the availability and price of scrap relative to primary aluminum.50 Casting Following the production of molten aluminum with the desired properties, the molten aluminum is cast into a long, cylindrically shaped billet (extrusion billet) of dimensions suitable for the extrusion process. The molten aluminum is transferred to a holding hearth where it is kept at the desired level of purity and temperature until it is ready to be poured into a casting unit with a mold. As the molten aluminum flows into the casting unit, cold water pumped around the base of the mold cools and solidifies it into the shape of the mold. Solid billets removed from the casting unit are sometimes sent to a homogenizing furnace for reheating and slow cooling to ensure that the chemical composition is consistent throughout. Pure aluminum (in the 1000 series alloys) does not respond to heat treatment, so the homogenization process only can be applied to 2000 series alloys containing copper, 6000 series alloys containing silicon and magnesium, or 7000 series alloys containing zinc. Other aluminum alloys, in the 3000, 4000, and 5000 series, cannot be effectively heat treated either.51 Extrusion After the billets have been homogenized, they are typically sent to a different facility or a different part of an integrated facility. The billets are typically scalped to remove the top layer that may contain impurities or surface defects. Next, the billets are reheated in a furnace to render the aluminum more malleable (figure I-2). A film of lubricant is applied to the heated 49 Petitioners note that the share of primary aluminum versus secondary aluminum used in the production of extrusions may vary by country. Preliminary conference transcript, pp. 138–139 (DeFrancesco). 50 Aluminum: Competitive Conditions Affecting the U.S. Industry, Inv. No. 332-557, USITC Publication 4703, June 2017, pp. 138, 166–167. 51 L&L Furnace, “Aluminum Heat Treatment: Homogenizing,” June 11, 2021, https://llfurnace.com/blog/aluminum-heat-treatment-homogenizing; table I-21. I-41 billet. From there, a heated billet enters the hydraulic extrusion press where a ram pushes a dummy block to force the softened metal through a precision opening (or die) in a tool-steel plate to produce the desired shape.52 To produce tubular or hollow-profile products, the die is fitted with a plug or mandrel to shape the inner surface.53 Larger presses allow extruders to produce larger products.54 As pressure is applied against the die, the billet becomes shorter and wider until its expansion is restricted by full contact with the container walls. As the pressure increases, the softened metal begins to squeeze out through the shaped orifice of the die and emerges as a fully formed profile. This process is referred to as “direct extrusion.” Under “indirect extrusion,” the die is contained within a hollow ram, which moves into the stationary billet, thereby forcing the metal to flow into the ram, and acquiring the shape of the die as it proceeds. In either process, the aluminum exiting the die acquires the same cross-sectional shape as the die. Materials such as liquid nitrogen flow around the die to cool it as the extruded aluminum is passing through. This process protects the die and extends its life while also preventing the formation of oxides on the surface of the extruded shape. After emerging from the die, the extrusion cools, either by air exposure or through air or water quenching. The following steps usually occur after cooling: • Stretching— A stretcher and/or straightener may be applied to straighten the extrusion and correct any twisting that may have occurred during or after the extrusion process. • Cutting— The profile is cut to the specified commercial length. The cut product is in a “mill finish” state at the conclusion of this phase. • Aging— Certain extrusion alloys reach optimal strength through the process of aging or age-hardening. The aging process ensures the uniform precipitation of fine particles through the metal, producing an alloy with maximum strength, hardness, and elasticity. Natural aging occurs at room temperature and artificial aging occurs through controlled heating in an aging oven. Non-heat-treatable aluminum alloys, including 3000 series alloys utilizing manganese, are subject to 52 For further information, see: Momentum Manufacturing Group LLC, “Aluminum Extrusion Manufacturing 101: Understanding Extrusion Die Types,” ©2024, https://mmgextrusions.com/resources/aluminum-extrusion-die-types, accessed August 30, 2024. Dies can be produced either on-site by the extruders or purchased from outside die vendors. Most extruders perform die repair and maintenance within their facilities.

I-42 natural aging. Artificial aging, also known as “precipitation heat-treating,” occurs through controlled heating in an aging oven. The scope also includes extrusions that have been drawn subsequent to extrusion (drawn aluminum). To produce drawn aluminum, the extruded shape, after cooling, is subsequently drawn over a mandrel to create a hollow profile. This hollow profile may then be subject to natural or artificial aging to improve strength characteristics.

Mill-finish aluminum extrusions are either prepared for packaging and shipping to customers, or may undergo additional finishing or processing, such as surface coating or treatments (e.g., painting, anodizing, sanding, acid-etching, nickel finishing, etc.). Aluminum extrusions may also undergo fabrication and/or assembly operations such as cutting to length, machining (including CNC machining), drilling, punching, notching, bending, stretching, threading, etching, engraving, etc. After completing all finishing, processing, and fabricating operations, the extrusions are packaged and distributed to customers. Domestic like product issues In the preliminary phase of these investigations, the Commission rejected several arguments concerning particular products and defined a single domestic like product, coextensive with the scope. In the final phase of these investigations, three parties requested data on specific products relevant to the analysis of the domestic like product: Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”) requested data collection related to the analysis of crash relevant (“CR”) extrusions; Reflection Window + Wall, LLC (“Reflection”) requested data collection related to the analysis of window wall units; and MAHLE and Valeo North America, Inc. (“Valeo”) requested data collection related to the analysis of in-scope aluminum extrusions manufactured into heat exchangers. I-43 The Commission’s questionnaires collected detailed information related to CR extrusions, including (among other data) firms’ responses regarding the domestic like product factors, channels of distribution, average unit values, and U.S. production operations.55 These data are presented in tables I-22 through I-26. 56 55 According to a petitioners’ hearing witness, there is not necessarily a clear definition of “crash\u0002relevant,” even among aluminum extruders and automotive original-equipment manufacturers, but rather an amorphous category. Moreover, many extrusions that would not otherwise be considered crash relevant still meet the yield and tensile strength requirements. Hearing transcript, pp. 47–48 (Butterfield). Petitioners’ witnesses further testified that CR extrusions are part of the continuum of aluminum extrusion products, by sharing the same general physical characteristics as other extrusions, being produced by the same U.S. extruders in the same facilities on the same equipment, and being sold in overlapping channels of distribution, although not within the range of prices of other extrusions. Hearing transcript, p. 30 (Peish), pp. 39– 41 (El-Sabaawi), pp. 47– 52 (Butterfield), p. 143 (Butterfield), p. 165 (Hamilton). Tesla however argues that certain distinctions such as an exacting combination of mechanical properties and a unique combination of specialized production processes “…separate CR extrusions from the other in-scope extrusions in a manner that is above and beyond the differences present between the products encompassed in the continuum of OCR extrusions. Therefore, there is a clear dividing line between CR and OCR extrusions such that CR extrusions constitute a separate like product.” Tesla’s posthearing brief, Posthearing Commissioner Q&A Responses, p. 14. 56 Detailed data for CR extrusions and for all other kinds of extrusions (“other than CR extrusions” or “OCR”), including questionnaire respondents’ narrative responses, import data and financial data, are included in apps.

II-1 Part II: Conditions of competition in the U.S. market U.S. market characteristics Aluminum extrusions are produced and imported in various shapes and forms, including but not limited to hollow profiles, solid profiles, pipes, tubes, bars, and rods. Additionally, aluminum extrusions can be drawn, finished, or fabricated.1 Extrusions are used in a variety of applications, including building and construction (e.g., windows, door railings, curtain walls, highway and bridge construction), transportation (e.g., automotive and electric vehicles, aircraft, rail, recreation vehicles, aerospace, marine, and other mass transit vehicles), renewable energy projects (e.g., solar module frames, solar racking systems, frames and structural fasteners), and engineered production applications (e.g., air conditioners, appliances, furniture, lighting, sports equipment, personal watercraft, electrical power units, refrigeration, medical and laboratory equipment, display structures).2 Aluminum extrusions’ performance characteristics include high strength, low weight, high corrosion-resistance, and machineability.3 Some producers of aluminum extrusions make a variety of aluminum extrusions in the same facility.4 Twenty of 30 U.S. producers and 31 of 85 importers indicated that the aluminum extrusions market was subject to distinctive conditions of competition. Importer *** reported low pricing from countries such as Turkey and Asian nations as impacting domestic competition. U.S. producer *** stated that tariffs on non-fabricated extrusions create disadvantages for domestic fabricators. U.S. producer *** stated that the global economy and raw material availability also affected the U.S. aluminum extrusion market. Additionally, importer *** reported that there is difficulty in obtaining automotive aluminum extrusions due to a lack of reliable and consistent supply as domestic producers prefer to produce less demanding products over automotive extrusions, affecting supply reliability. U.S. producers *** indicated that the competitive nature of the market, influenced by low-priced imports from countries like Mexico, Turkey, South Korea, and Indonesia, makes the aluminum extrusions market price-sensitive, with unfairly priced and subsidized imports impacting domestic capacity utilization and pricing. 1 Petition, p. 11. 2 Petitioner prehearing brief, pp.44-45; Exhibit 14. 3 Certain Aluminum Extrusions from China, Inv.

II-2 According to these firms, these dynamics and the need for improved product tolerances contribute to the competitive conditions in the U.S. aluminum extrusion market. Apparent U.S. consumption of aluminum extrusions decreased during 2021-23. From 2021-22, apparent U.S. consumption by quantity increased by *** percent and then decreased from 2022-23 by *** percent. Overall, apparent U.S. consumption in 2023 was *** percent lower by quantity than in 2021. U.S. purchasers The Commission received 56 usable questionnaire responses from firms that had purchased aluminum extrusions during 2021-23. 5 6 7 Eighteen responding purchasers are distributors, 30 are end users, and 15 are other users (including a variety of downstream 5 The following firms provided purchaser questionnaire responses: ***. 6 Of the 56 responding purchasers, 48 purchased domestic aluminum extrusions, 13 purchased imports of the subject merchandise from China, 7 purchased nonsubject imports from China, 1 purchased subject imports from Colombia, 3 purchased subject imports from Ecuador, 10 purchased subject imports from India, 7 purchased subject imports from Indonesia, none purchased product from Italy (subject or nonsubject), 5 purchased subject imports from Malaysia, 2 purchased nonsubject imports from Malaysia, 21 purchased subject imports from Mexico, 4 purchased subject imports from South Korea, 1 purchased nonsubject imports from South Korea, 8 purchased subject imports from Taiwan, 1 purchased subject imports from Taiwan, 5 purchased subject imports from Thailand, 12 purchased subject imports from Turkey, 6 purchased subject imports from United Arab Emirates, 17 purchased subject imports from Vietnam, 17 purchased from nonsubject sources, and 16 purchased imports of aluminum extrusions from all other sources. 7 Fifty purchasers indicated they had marketing/pricing knowledge of domestic product, 26 of Chinese subject product, eight of Colombian product, 10 of Ecuadorian product, 18 of Indian product, 14 of Indonesian product, 8 of Italian product, 11 of Malaysian product, 34 of Mexican product, 13 of South Korean product, 16 of Taiwanese product, 12 of Thai product, 20 of Turkish product, 10 of United Arab Emirates product, 24 of Vietnamese product, and 11 of nonsubject countries product. II-3 product producers and service providers).8 Overall, responding U.S. purchasers were located in all regions of the continental United States. The responding purchasers represented firms in a variety of domestic industries, including agricultural equipment manufacturing, production of audio/video equipment, automotive manufacturing, boat building, building and construction with construction services, commercial and transport use, contract manufacturing and machining, contractor supplies, curtain walls in construction, fencing distribution and installation, funeral services, furniture, glazing and material distribution, heat exchangers manufacturing, home improvement retail, HVAC assemblies and parts, lighting, manufacturing with contracting and fabrication, marine products, recreational vehicles, screen and shades manufacturing, shower doors, solar products and distribution, trailer manufacturing, windows and doors manufacturing.

Purchaser *** did not report a firm type, and some firms reported being multiple firm types. Purchasers *** reported being both end users and distributors, while purchasers *** also reported being other users. II-4 Impact of section 301 tariffs and 232 tariffs Certain aluminum extrusions have been subject to section 301 tariffs since August 2019.9 Aluminum extrusions were also subject to Section 232 tariffs beginning in March 2018; however, most aluminum extrusions were excluded from Section 232 tariffs in December 2020.10 Certain aluminum extrusions from China have been under antidumping and countervailing duty orders since May 2011.11 U.S. producers, importers, and purchasers were asked to report if Section 301 tariffs have impacted costs, price, or overall demand in the U.S. aluminum extrusion market. Most reporting producers (24 of 31), importers (74 of 96), and purchasers (44 of 56) reported that the 301 tariffs did not have an impact or were unaware of the 301 tariffs’ effect on the aluminum extrusion market. Among U.S. producers, reports were mixed when describing the impact of Section 301 tariffs on aluminum extrusions. While some U.S. producers saw increased domestic business and competitiveness, others reported minimal effects. U.S. producer *** reported that there had been an increase in companies seeking business in the US as they attempted to source domestically. In contrast, U.S. producer *** stated that the tariffs made U.S. producers more competitive. U.S. producers *** reported that there was only a minimal impact from the section 301 tariffs, adding that they experienced some short-term relief for the domestic industry but that imports are still significantly undercutting their prices. Among importers describing impacts of 301 tariffs, *** reported significant price increases, noting a 25 percent rise in prices for aluminum extrusions sourced from China. In response to these price rises, importers *** indicated that they adjusted their supply chains by shifting sourcing to countries like Vietnam and Thailand. Importers *** stated that they observed increased domestic prices as a direct result of the tariffs, while importer *** report that it struggled with a loss of global competitiveness due to the higher prices caused by the tariffs. Among purchasers describing the impact of 301 tariffs, *** indicated that they also experienced increased prices due to the tariffs, with suppliers passing on these added costs. Some purchasers, such as ***, stated that they faced supply chain disruptions, with domestic suppliers unable to meet 9 China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 84 FR 43,304, August 20, 2019. 10 83 FR 11619, March 15, 2018, and 85 FR 81,060, December 14, 2020. 11 76 FR 30,650 and 76 FR 30,653, May 26, 2011. II-5 demand, forcing purchasers to seek alternative suppliers, often leading to price hikes and longer lead times. To avoid the impact of the tariffs, purchaser *** stated that it focused on sourcing materials from countries other than China. U.S. producers, importers, and purchasers were also asked to report if Section 232 tariffs have impacted costs, price, or overall demand in the U.S. aluminum extrusion market. Most reporting producers *** reported that Section 232 tariffs had impacted the U.S. aluminum extrusion market. In contrast, most importers *** and purchasers *** reported that the 232 tariffs did not have an impact or that they were unaware of the 232 tariffs’ impact on the aluminum extrusion market. Some U.S. producers reported that the imposition of Section 232 tariffs on aluminum extrusions initially provided some relief to domestic producers, while other producers experienced minimal impact. U.S. producers *** reported that the Section 232 tariffs offered limited protection against lower-priced imports. Despite the tariffs, unfairly priced imports continued to enter the market, significantly underselling domestic products. U.S. producers *** stated that the tariffs increased raw material costs, raising production expenses for U.S. firms as the price of aluminum was driven higher by the tariffs. Thus, they concluded that domestic companies were at a disadvantage compared to foreign competitors. U.S. producers *** reported that the Section 232 tariffs provided short-term relief to the domestic industry. However, they added that the subsequent exclusion of aluminum extrusions from the tariffs led to a surge in imports, negatively affecting U.S. producers in the long run. Additionally, U.S. producers *** stated that the tariffs encouraged customers to bring back production from China or allowed U.S. companies to become more competitive due to the higher costs of imports. U.S. producers *** also reported that exemptions given to certain countries under trade agreements like NAFTA weakened the protective effects of the tariffs, as these exemptions allowed certain countries to sell aluminum into the U.S. market at lower costs. Among importers, *** stated that they experienced increased prices and longer lead times as domestic mills reached capacity. Importers *** reported price increases for raw materials and imported products, making it difficult for U.S. downstream-product producers to compete with foreign suppliers who benefited from subsidies. Importers *** stated they had seen reshoring efforts in response to the section 232 tariffs. They added that the tariffs led to higher costs for importers, adversely impacting U.S. downstream manufacturers' ability to compete due to elevated material prices. II-6 Purchasers that described the section 232 tariffs as having an impact generally indicated that either prices or lead times rose. Purchasers *** reported increased prices due to the tariffs. Additionally, purchasers *** stated that they experienced increased lead times and capacity constraints due to near-shoring efforts. At the same time, these purchasers indicated that domestic suppliers sometimes had raised prices. Channels of distribution U.S. producers and importers of products from ten subject countries (***) sold mainly to end users (automotive or other) during 2021-2023, as shown in Table II-1.

Counts equal the number of firms reporting “yes.” Note: Responding U.S. producers accounted for a majority of U.S. production of aluminum extrusions in 2023. Responding foreign producer/exporter firms accounted for less than half of U.S. aluminum extrusion imports from subject countries during 2023. No data were reported for ***. For additional data on the number of responding firms and their share of U.S. production and U.S. imports from each subject country, please refer to Part VII, “Subject countries.” II-13 Domestic production Based on available information, U.S. producers of aluminum extrusions have the ability to respond to changes in demand with moderate to high changes in the quantity of shipments of U.S.-produced aluminum extrusions to the U.S. market. The main contributing factor to this degree of responsiveness of supply is the availability of unused capacity and availability of inventories that are similar with subject countries. Factors mitigating the responsiveness of supply include limited availability of inventories and limited ability to shift production from alternate products. Subject imports from subject countries In general, producers in subject countries have the ability to respond to changes in demand with moderate-to-large changes in the quantity of shipments of aluminum extrusions to the U.S. market, although the ability to respond varies by country. The main contributing factors to this degree of responsiveness of supply are the availability of unused capacity and an ability to shift shipments from alternative markets and production. Factors mitigating the responsiveness of supply include a limited ability to shift shipments from inventories and lead times. Production capacity in most reporting subject countries increased during 2021-23. Specifically, capacity increased in nine countries, with significant increases from China, not under order(s) (***), Turkey (***), Mexico (***), India, subject (***), and Vietnam (***); while capacity remained relatively constant or slightly decreased for four subject countries.13 In 2023, eight subject countries had capacity utilization rates between 60 and 90 percent, two had rates below 60 percent, 14 and three (***) had rates over 90 percent. Reported inventories (as a share of shipments) in most subject countries increased from 2021 to 2023, and the share of inventories in *** reporting subject countries was lower than U.S. producers’ inventories in 2023.15 Combined subject countries’ exports to both the United States and other markets accounted for about *** percent of their total sales, although the shares varied widely by 13 The Commission did not receive any questionnaire responses from foreign producers in ***. 14 Countries with capacity utilization rates below 60 percent include ***. 15 *** had higher inventory ratios than the United States in 2023. II-14 country. As a whole, all subject foreign producers cumulatively reported 74.0 percent of their shipments to their home market, with individual shares of shipments to each country’s home market ranging from less than 7.5 percent to over 89.9 percent in 2023. Five countries’ reported shares of shipments to the home market that ranged from 30 to 70 percent.16 Subject country exports to non-U.S. markets ranged from 0.4 percent to over 50 percent, with most countries’ exports ranging from 20 to 50 percent. However, subject foreign producers cumulatively exported 18.1 percent of their exports to non-U.S. markets. Four subject countries, including the two with large capacity (***), exported more than 30 percent of their total shipments to non-U.S. markets in 2023, indicating some ability to shift shipments from alternate markets. Only one foreign producer stated an ability to shift production from aluminum extrusions to other products.17 Imports from nonsubject sources Nonsubject imports accounted for 43.0 percent of total U.S. imports in 2023. The largest source of nonsubject imports during 2021-23 were from Canada and Germany. Combined, these countries accounted for 70.5 percent of nonsubject imports in 2023. Supply constraints Nineteen of 30 U.S. producers, 19 of 87 importers, and 27 of 54 purchasers reported that they had experienced supply constraints in 2021. Fourteen of 30 U.S. producers, 13 of 88 importers, and 31 of 55 purchasers reported that they experienced supply constraints in 2022, and in 2023, 3 of 29 reporting U.S. producers, 6 of 89 importers, and 9 of 54 purchasers reported that they experienced supply constraints prior to the petition. Additionally, no U.S. producers, 18 of 92 importers, and 9 of 55 purchasers reported supply constraints post-petition in 2023 and 2024 (table II-4). 16 *** reported over 90 percent shipments to their home market. 17 These other products included ***.

U.S. producers in the aluminum extrusion industry report various challenges and constraints. In 2021, U.S. producers *** reported 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 2021 2022 Pre-petition: 2023 Post-petition: 2023 and 2024 Count (number of firms) U.S. producers Importers Purchasers II-16 facing heightened demand from customers who were over-ordering or requesting historically high volumes as part of post-pandemic recovery efforts. Similarly, U.S. producers *** reported difficulties meeting the massive surge in demand, leading to extended lead times and strategic reviews of customer viability to prioritize long-term commitments. They added that labor shortages and raw material procurement difficulties, particularly aluminum billets and paints, added to these constraints. In 2022, as the COVID-19 pandemic's effects began to subside, U.S. producers *** reported that their supply constraints eased. In 2023, many U.S. producers described having recovered from the worst supply issues, with U.S. producer *** reporting unutilized capacity. It added that demand had slowed in the second and third quarters of 2023, leading to fewer supply chain constraints across the industry. Importers (many of which can either import or purchase domestically) also reported various supply constraints, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges included insufficient domestic supplier capacity, international shipping availability constraints, labor shortages, increased demand exceeding capacity, and supply chain restraints. Importers *** described extended lead times and allocation challenges from domestic suppliers. Multiple importers reported that the pandemic led to increased demand, labor shortages, and shipping delays, resulting in firms being unable to accept new customers or meet project timelines. Importers *** reported they had to switch suppliers due to domestic producers being unable to meet demands, causing significant delays and qualification costs. Additionally, importers *** stated they had to decline new business due to production capacity limits strategically. Multiple importers reported that many of these constraints persisted in 2022, with importers *** indicating they continued to face lead-time extensions and difficulties securing domestic supply. Importers *** stated that ongoing shortages led to unfilled customer orders and allocation measures. Importers *** reported that they still faced allocations and extended lead times early in 2023, though conditions improved around mid-year. Importer *** reported that they continued to experience difficulties finding domestic suppliers willing to meet their stringent requirements for new projects, such as the ***. Many responding purchasers reported that there were supply constraints. For 2021 (27 of 54 responding purchasers), 2022 (31 of 55), and 2023 (9 of 55) reported that they had experienced supply issues. Purchasers *** reported being placed on allocation restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, labor shortages, and II-17 overwhelming demand. Additionally, purchasers *** reported that they experienced delayed shipments and limited capacities. Similarly, purchasers *** stated that their orders were declined by U.S. producers who could not handle increased demand. Purchaser *** reported that by 2023, some improvements were made, and allocations were lifted by the end of the first quarter. However, purchasers *** reported that they still faced constraints due to the impact of the earlier disruptions from previous years. New suppliers Most purchasers indicated that no new suppliers entered the U.S. market since January 1, 2021. Twelve purchasers did describe new entrants, citing Aluminum Insights, AJU Steel, Automotive Precision Technology (APT), Cortizo, Florida Aluminum Alliance, and Sam Woo Group as new suppliers. U.S. demand Based on available information, the overall demand for aluminum extrusions is likely to experience moderate changes in response to changes in price. The main contributing factors are the somewhat limited range of substitute products and the wide range of cost sharing percentages across various end-use products. End uses and cost share The demand for aluminum extrusions in the U.S. depends on the demand for U.S.- produced downstream products. Reported end uses include building and construction, doors and windows, automotive, trailers, marine vehicles, solar applications, and electrical applications. Given the wide variety of end uses for aluminum extrusions, U.S. producers, importers, and purchasers reported a wide range of cost shares, depending on the end-use products. Reported cost shares for some end uses were as follows:18 • *** percent for automotive/recreational vehicle applications, • *** percent for building and construction components, • *** percent for consumer/household goods applications, • *** percent for marine applications, 18 Some firms reported that aluminum extrusions make up *** percent of the costs of building and construction components. II-18 • *** percent for HVAC/ refrigeration applications, • *** percent for solar mounting, and • *** percent for trailers Business cycles Twenty-three of 31 U.S. producers, 35 of 88 importers, and 36 of 54 purchasers indicated that the U.S. aluminum extrusion market was subject to business cycles. Specifically, U.S. producers' demand for aluminum extrusions is closely tied to the construction, automotive, and consumer goods markets. U.S. producers *** stated that interest rates, economic recessions, and slower growth periods affect demand, especially in the commercial and residential building sectors. Seasonal trends are also evident, with demand typically higher in spring and summer, as reported by U.S. producers ***. These firms described cyclical slowdowns in demand in the first and last quarters of each year. Importers reported experiencing the influence of broader economic cycles and seasonal demand, particularly in sectors like solar energy, automotive, and construction. Importers *** indicated that their industries are influenced by interest rates, with downturns starting in late 2022. Importer *** reported that the impact of hurricanes and weather cycles influence business cycles, while importer *** stated that demand fluctuates with federal tax incentives and solar installation deadlines. U.S. purchasers generally described demand for aluminum extrusions as following the cycles of the industries they serve, including construction, automotive, and consumer goods. U.S. purchasers *** reported that their demand is linked to automotive and construction markets, with seasonality driving higher demand in warmer months. Purchasers *** stated that the solar industry they operate in is affected by federal tax incentives, interest rates, and state policies, which cause demand to rise and fall based on policy changes. Purchasers *** also reported experiencing seasonality due to weather and construction schedules, with demand generally higher in spring and summer. II-19 Demand trends Given the wide variety of applications for aluminum extrusions, various downstream industries influence the demand for aluminum extrusions. Notably, aluminum extrusions are widely used in residential and non-residential construction19 and automobile production.20 New housing starts have fluctuated since January 2021. Housing starts generally increased from January 2021 to March 2022, with a substantial drop in housing starts in April 2022. After April 2022, housing starts have fluctuated but generally decreased, as high mortgage rates have depressed some demand for new housing.21 22 Overall, new housing starts have declined 4.3 percent from January 2021 to December 2023. From December 2023 to March 2024, average housing starts have fluctuated, with a spike in February 2024 and a significant decrease in March 2024. 19 As noted above, applications in the construction industry include windows, doors railings, curtain walls, window walls, highway and bridge construction, framing members. Petition, p. 12. 20 There has been a shift in the automotive industry towards lightweighting, or minimizing vehicle weight, by using more aluminum components. Electric vehicles, which typically have bigger and heavier batteries relative to combustion engines, in particular use more aluminum in their bodies to offset the weight of the batteries. Aluminum also absorbs more energy per kilogram than steel, possibly making it safer in a crash, and aluminum-bodied cars have less general service damage than steel-bodied vehicles.

Aluminum extrusions are utilized in various types of non-residential commercial construction. Therefore, the demand for aluminum extrusions is also derived from the demand for non-residential construction, infrastructure projects, and commercial and institutional II-22 construction. As such, an uptick in nonresidential construction spending signals increased demand for aluminum extrusions. Monthly values of nonresidential construction spending are shown in Figure II-3. Non-residential construction spending increased by 21.5 percent between January 2021 and December 2023 and 15.4 percent from December 2023 to March 2024, suggesting higher demand for aluminum extrusions.

Most producers and purchasers reported decreased U.S. demand for aluminum extrusions, while most importers reported increased U.S. demand since January 1, 2021 (table II-8). U.S. producers reported a downward trend in demand, particularly from 2022 or 2023 II-26 onwards, with various economic and market factors contributing to this decline. U.S. producers *** reported overall that there was a downward trend for the demand of domestic aluminum extrusions, and U.S. producers *** reported a strong demand for aluminum extrusions in 2021- 2022, followed by a decrease in 2023-2024. U.S. producers *** stated that inflationary pressures and high interest rates contributed to the decline in demand for domestic aluminum extrusions, with *** adding that COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions also contributed to the decrease in demand. U.S. producers *** reported that increased imports from subject countries have caused a reduction in demand for domestic products. Most purchasers also reported a decline in demand, especially from 2022 onwards. Purchasers *** reported a spike in demand during or immediately after COVID-19 restrictions; however, following the spike, demand normalized or declined. Various economic conditions were reported as reasons for decreased demand for domestic aluminum extrusions. Purchasers *** reported that inflation-related price increases reduced demand for domestic aluminum extrusions. Purchaser *** reported that the decrease in demand for domestic aluminum extrusions was due to the slowdown in building and construction. Purchaser *** added that consumer preference for vinyl windows and doors over aluminum windows and doors caused a decrease in demand for domestic aluminum extrusions. Purchaser *** also stated that the need for more capacity from U.S. suppliers in 2022 has caused a decline in demand for domestic products.

II-27 Substitute products Fourteen of 30 U.S. producers, as well as a majority of importers (73 of 90) and purchasers (38 of 52), reported that there are no substitutes for aluminum extrusions. Those firms that described substitutes listed composites, carbon fiber, vinyl, plastic, steel, fiberglass, wood, and other metals. Most firms that described substitutes also reported that the price of substitutes did affect the price of aluminum extrusions. Firms reported that cost comparison plays a significant role, as cheaper substitutes such as steel or vinyl can pressure aluminum prices. Industry\u0002specific trends also impact pricing, with the automotive industry's shift towards lightweight materials increasing demand for aluminum over steel despite steel being less expensive. Additionally, the aluminum extrusion industry, particularly in the automotive sector, is characterized by a need for significant investment in new technologies and high-strength alloys to meet the exacting requirements of automotive manufacturers, who demand advanced processing capabilities and specialized equipment to produce complex, metallurgically driven profiles. 24 Firms also stated market dynamics, including supply and demand factors, affect the relationship between aluminum and substitute prices. Material properties, such as the density difference between aluminum and substitutes like copper, can affect pricing and usage. Additionally, manufacturing processes for substitutes can influence their competitiveness with aluminum extrusions. Substitutability issues This section assesses the degree to which U.S.-produced aluminum extrusions and imports of aluminum extrusions from subject countries can be substituted for one another by examining the importance of certain purchasing factors and the comparability of aluminum extrusions from domestic and imported sources based on those factors. Based on available data, staff believes there is a moderate-to-high degree of substitutability between domestically produced aluminum extrusions imported from subject sources.25 Factors contributing to this level of substitutability include availability, similarities between domestically produced 24 Tesla prehearing brief, Exhibit 2. 25 The degree of substitution between domestic and imported aluminum extrusions depends upon the extent of product differentiation between the domestic and imported products and reflects how easily purchasers can switch from domestically produced aluminum extrusions to the aluminum extrusions imported from subject countries (or vice versa) when prices change. The degree of substitution may include such factors as relative prices (discounts/rebates), quality differences (e.g., grade standards, defect rates, etc.), and differences in sales conditions (e.g., lead times between order and delivery dates, reliability of supply, product services, etc.). II-28 aluminum extrusions and aluminum extrusions imported from subject countries across multiple purchase factors, and interchangeability between domestic and subject sources. Factors reducing substitutability include purchaser preferences for aluminum extrusions based on past performance, brand, origin for products, and advance processing within specific end-uses. 26 Factors affecting purchasing decisions Purchaser decisions based on source As shown in Table II-9, most purchasers and their customers sometimes or never make purchasing decisions based on the producer or country of origin. Of the 12 purchasers who reported that they always make decisions based on the manufacturer, two firms cited quality and high standards, and two stated product requirements, such as meeting precise fabrication requirements and service offerings. Other reasons cited include long-term relationships and trust, geographical preferences, reputation and past performance, and operational requirements.

Importance of purchasing domestic product Forty-seven of 56 purchasers reported that most or all of their purchases did not require purchasing U.S.-produced products. Four reported that domestic products were required by law (for 1 to 65 percent of their purchases), seven reported that they were required by their customers (for 1 to 96 percent of their purchases), and five reported other preferences for domestic products. Reasons cited for preferring domestic products included contracts with U.S. 26 Importer *** reports that the production of CR extrusions requires advanced press controls, water quenching, and heat treatment processes requiring specialized equipment to achieve the requirements by automotive OEMs which are not typically needed for other types of extrusions.

Note: Purchasers were asked how often domestically produced or imported aluminum extrusions meets minimum quality specifications for their own or their customers’ uses. Fifty-three of 56 responding purchasers reported factors that determined quality for aluminum extrusions. These factors include dimensional accuracy and consistency, material properties, and specifications, surface quality and finish, color consistency and matching, form, fit, and functionality, testing and quality control processes, heat transfer and metallurgical performance, necessary certifications, proper packaging and handling, and supplier reliability. Changes in purchasing patterns Half of the reporting purchasers (27 of 54) reported that they had changed suppliers since January 1, 2021. U.S. purchasers switch suppliers for various reasons, primarily centered around performance, capacity, pricing, and service quality. For instance, purchaser *** reported dropping suppliers due to poor service or quality issues, such as Jordan Aluminum, or because suppliers went out of business, like Aluminum Shapes. Purchasers *** added new suppliers due to growth, increased capacity needs, or domestic suppliers' inability to meet technical requirements. Additionally, purchasers *** added suppliers to diversify their supplier base to reduce supply II-34 chain risks or meet new product demands. Price competitiveness also drove changes, as purchaser *** stated. Purchasers were also asked about changes in their purchasing patterns from different countries since January 1, 2021 (table II-14). Overall purchasers reported a downward fluctuation or steadily decrease in purchasing U.S.-produced aluminum extrusions. Purchasers reported decreased purchases of U.S.-produced products because of various factors. Purchasers described market slowdown and reduced demand, especially as the pandemic effects began to wane. Additionally, purchasers reported supply constraints, stating that domestic sources could not meet demand or had extended lead times, forcing them to look for alternative suppliers. Some purchasers reported a shift in product preferences, such as from aluminum to vinyl products. Lastly, purchasers mentioned cost and competitiveness issues, stating that labor availability and assembly costs made them less competitive, particularly for low-end products. For subject and nonsubject sources, purchasers were primarily unchanged in their purchasing patterns, with some reporting increased purchases for China not under order(s), Mexico, and Turkey. Purchasers reported increased purchases of products from China not under order(s) due to various factors, including diversification strategies, technological shifts in heat exchanger production, availability of specific low-end products, increased demand for HVAC parts containing aluminum extrusions, and Mexican production capacity issues causing a shift to China. Additionally, purchasers reported increased purchases from Mexico due to various factors, including sourcing alternatives, domestic supply limitations, capacity issues, and the ability to meet specific technical requirements—strategic partnerships, supply chain relocations from Asia, and changes in market demand also influenced these shifts. Purchasers stated that they increased purchases from Turkey to shift suppliers due to newly available products, performance issues, or to secure additional capacity.

Purchase factor comparisons of domestic products, subject imports, and nonsubject imports Purchasers were asked a number of questions comparing aluminum extrusions produced in the United States, subject countries, and nonsubject countries. First, purchasers were asked for a country-by-country comparison on the same 16 factors (table II-15) for which they were asked to rate the importance. Most purchasers reported that U.S. and other sources of aluminum extrusions were comparable on all factors. Purchasers compared aluminum extrusions from subject sources against domestic sources and noted that they were comparable on almost all factors, with U.S. sources being superior in delivery time compared to China not under order(s). U.S. aluminum extrusions were inferior in price to aluminum extrusions from all subject sources.

Note: With respect to cost/price factors, a rating of superior means that the cost/price for the first source in the country pair is generally lower. For example, if a firm reported “U.S. superior,” it meant that the U.S. product was generally priced lower than the imported product. II-51 Comparison of U.S.-produced and imported aluminum extrusions In order to determine whether U.S.-produced aluminum extrusions can generally be used in the same applications as imports from subject sources, U.S. producers, importers, and purchasers were asked whether the products can always, frequently, sometimes, or never be used interchangeably. As shown in tables II-16 to II-18, most U.S. producers, importers, and purchasers reported that domestic and subject aluminum extrusions are always or frequently interchangeable. U.S. producer *** stated that the domestic industry can produce all aluminum extrusions currently being imported, and U.S. extrusions are always interchangeable with imported ones. Additionally, U.S. producer *** added that interchangeability within their system is not typical as they market complete systems. However, a project might choose a complete system from another country that can be interchangeable. Importers *** reported that while technically possible, changing suppliers would require validation testing and customer approval, which can limit interchangeability. Additionally, importers *** stated that potential color/finish differences can affect interchangeability. Importers *** reported that U.S. extruders often lack the technical ability to meet required tolerances or specifications, mainly for automotive or specialized applications, with importer *** adding that American extruders have larger, less strict tolerances than European extruders. Importer *** reported that U.S. extrusions are always interchangeable with imported ones. Among purchasers, additional comments on the interchangeability of U.S. and imported aluminum extrusions were mixed. Purchasers *** reported that aluminum extrusions are mostly interchangeable. In contrast, purchasers *** reported that the automotive industry requires strict technical requirements and qualification processes that limit interchangeability. *** stated that U.S. suppliers cannot produce specialized aluminum extrusion products because they cannot meet specifications, manufacturing capabilities, quality standards, and logistical constraints.

In addition, U.S. producers, importers, and purchasers were asked to assess how often differences other than price were significant in sales of aluminum extrusions from the United States, subject, or nonsubject countries. As seen in tables II-19 to II-21, most U.S. producers reported that aluminum extrusions from different sources sometimes or never have significant differences other than price. Multiple U.S. producers added that price often becomes the principal differentiating factor for aluminum extrusions under certain market conditions and operational constraints. U.S. producer *** stated the impact of imports underselling domestic products rendered other factors (like quality and lead time) insignificant. U.S. producer *** reported that provided lead times are within a 6-7 week window, pricing decisively influences sales decisions. It added that timing aligns sufficiently with cost considerations. U.S. producers *** reported that price ultimately dictates the choice between domestic and imported products due to distorted pricing from abroad, in which other elements barely influence purchasing decisions. U.S. producer *** added that despite supply constraints that lengthened lead times in 2021-2022, efforts were made to stabilize prices to maintain customer relationships, highlighting the central role of pricing in competitive strategy. II-55 Most importers and purchasers report that factors other than price were always or frequently significant. Importers *** stated that quality and specific supplier capabilities often override cost considerations. Importer *** stated that Malaysian suppliers' superior surface finishes and packaging were decisive factors, pointing to a preference for higher quality over lower cost. Importers *** indicated that they prioritize supplier capacity and problem-solving capabilities, which are crucial for their operations. Additionally, importer *** stated that poor service and inadequate delivery from domestic suppliers often compel it to seek better service and reliability overseas, regardless of price differences. Importers *** reported technical needs specific to certain products as reasons to choose foreign suppliers who can meet these requirements more effectively—additionally, importer *** stated that strategic relationships and operational efficiencies are factors that characterize superior products.

II-57 Elasticity estimates This section discusses elasticity estimates; parties were encouraged to comment on these estimates. None did so. U.S. supply elasticity The domestic supply elasticity for aluminum extrusions measures the sensitivity of the quantity supplied by U.S. producers to changes in the U.S. market price of aluminum extrusions. The elasticity of domestic supply depends on several factors, including the level of excess capacity, the ease with which producers can alter capacity, producers’ ability to shift to the production of other products, the existence of inventories, and the availability of alternate markets for U.S.-produced aluminum extrusions. Analysis of these factors indicates that the U.S. industry has the ability to reasonably increase shipments to the U.S. market; an estimate in the range of 4.0 to 6.0 is suggested. U.S. demand elasticity The U.S. demand elasticity for aluminum extrusions measures the sensitivity of the overall quantity demanded to a change in the U.S. market price of aluminum extrusions. This estimate depends on factors such as the existence, availability, and commercial viability of substitute products, as well as the component share of aluminum extrusions in the production of downstream products. Based on the available information, the aggregate demand for aluminum extrusions is likely to be moderately inelastic; a range of -0.5 to -1.0 is suggested. Substitution elasticity The elasticity of substitution depends upon the extent of product differentiation between domestic and imported products.27 Product differentiation, in turn, depends upon such factors as quality (e.g., chemistry, appearance, etc.) and conditions of sale (e.g., availability, sales terms/discounts/promotions, etc.). Based on available information, the elasticity of substitution between U.S.-produced aluminum extrusions and imported aluminum extrusions is likely to be in the range of 3.0 to 5.0. Factors contributing to this level of substitutability include the availability of both domestically produced and imported aluminum extrusions, which allows purchasers flexibility in sourcing based on price and delivery times. 27 The substitution elasticity measures the responsiveness of the relative U.S. consumption levels of the subject imports and the domestic like products to changes in their relative prices. This reflects how easily purchasers switch from the U.S. product to the subject products (or vice versa) when prices change. II-58 Aluminum extrusions from domestic and subject sources are comparable across multiple purchasing factors such as quality, specifications, and performance, making them suitable substitutes for one another. Additionally, for many applications, aluminum extrusions from either source can be used interchangeably without significant modifications or adjustments. However, some importers and purchasers noted differences in quality or specific characteristics between U.S. product and subject imports. III-1 Part III: U.S. producers’ production, shipments, and employment The Commission analyzes a number of factors in making injury determinations (see 19 U.S.C. §§ 1677(7)(B) and 1677(7)(C)). Information on the subsidies and dumping margins was presented in Part I of this report and information on the volume and pricing of imports of the subject merchandise is presented in Part IV and Part V. Information on the other factors specified is presented in this section and/or Part VI and (except as noted) is based on the questionnaire responses of 31 firms that accounted for the majority of U.S. production of aluminum extrusions during 2023. 1 U.S. producers The Commission issued a U.S. producer questionnaire to 62 firms based on information contained in the petition. Thirty-one firms provided usable data on their operations.2 Table III-1 lists U.S. producers of aluminum extrusions, their production locations, positions on the petition, and shares of total production. 3 1 The petitioners used shipments as a proxy for production in discussing industry support for the petition. Petition, pp. 2-6. Petitioners estimate that total U.S. shipments of aluminum extrusions in 2022 was 1,900,303 short tons. Petition, p. 6. U.S. producers’ U.S. shipments totaled 1,398,529 short tons in 2022, or 73.6 percent of petitioners’ total U.S. shipments figure. 2 *** reported anomalous and/or incomplete information in their final phase U.S. producer questionnaires. While each company responded to staff follow-up questions, they were unable to resolve all identified data issues related to reported data. As a result, neither company’s data is included in the staff report. 3 The Commission also gathered information on U.S. producers’ operations related to further fabrication or processing of purchased extrusions (i.e., extrusions that weren’t self-produced). Four firms, ***, reported further processing of purchased extrusions, with such production totaling *** short tons from 2021 through January-March (“interim”) 2024 (or *** percent of U.S. producers’ production of self-extruded extrusions over the same period). All four of these firms also extruded their own aluminum products. Given this low volume and the absence of any reporting firms without extruding operations that only fabricated or processed extrusions, information on fabrication-only operations is not included in Parts III or VI of the report.

III-23 Table III-7 and figure III-1 present U.S. producers’ production, capacity, and capacity utilization. Capacity increased 0.7 percent from 2021-23, and was 0.8 percent higher in interim 2024 than in interim 2023. Production however decreased 15.4 percent from 2021-23 and was 6.8 percent lower in interim 2024 than in interim 2023. Accordingly, capacity utilization decreased 13.4 percentage points from 2021-23 and was 5.5 percentage points lower in interim 2024 than in interim 2023. 6 More firms reported decreases in capacity than increases (11 firms reporting decreases compared to 10 firms reporting increases) and the majority of firms reported decreases in production (27 firms out of 31) from 2021-23. Between interim 2023 and interim 2024, seven firms reported increased capacity while five firms reported decreased capacity. Between the same periods, 12 firms reported increases in production, while 19 firms reported decreases in production. 6 Witnesses at the Commission’s hearing indicated that during the timeline of the COVID pandemic, strong but temporary bursts of demand led to considerations towards increasing capacity and improving capability of certain extrusion lines. Increased capacity for certain lines also helped increase labor availability for certain in-demand shifts. See hearing transcript, pp. 150-152 (Aboud, Dillett, McEvoy).

IV-1 Part IV: U.S. imports, apparent U.S. consumption, and market shares U.S. importers The Commission issued importer questionnaires to 458 firms believed to be importers of subject aluminum extrusions, as well as to all U.S. producers of aluminum extrusions.1 Usable questionnaire responses were received from 113 companies, representing the following percentages of U.S. imports in 2023 under HTS statistical reporting numbers 7604.10.1000, 7604.10.3000, 7604.10.5000, 7604.21.0010, 7604.21.0090, 7604.29.1010, 7604.29.1090, 7604.29.3060, 7604.29.3090, 7604.29.5050, 7604.29.5090, 7608.10.0030, 7608.10.0090, 7608.20.0030, 7608.20.0090, 7609.00.0000, 7610.10.0010, 7610.10.0020, 7610.10.0030, 7610.90.0040 and 7610.90.0080, as adjusted:2 3 1 The Commission issued questionnaires to certain firms identified in the petition, along with several firms identified through staff research and a review of data from third-party sources. The petitions identified several thousand total firms as potential importers; for administrative efficiency, staff identified approximately 20 top firms from each subject source, as well as nonsubject sources, to be issued questionnaires. Questionnaires were also sent to firms who responded in the preliminary phase and to importers identified by foreign producers. 2 These are the “primary” HTS numbers identified in the scope as numbers under which the subject merchandise is provided for. U.S. import data are based on U.S. import statistics of the U.S. Department of Commerce Census Bureau using these HTS statistical reporting numbers. Further adjustments to certain tables in this report may include using data submitted in response to Commission questionnaires to: (1) report data for extrusions from China that are entered under existing orders and thus not in\u0002scope (“China, under order(s)”), and for extrusions from China not entered under existing orders and thus generally in-scope (“China, not under order(s)”); (2) to add in in-scope imports entered under non\u0002primary HTS statistical reporting numbers; and (3) to remove products other than aluminum extrusions (i.e., out-of-scope merchandise). Additionally, certain data compiled from proprietary Census-edited, Customs records using the same statistical reporting numbers listed above were used in certain tables to: (4) remove imports reported by firms that certified \"no\" for their questionnaire response that they do not import aluminum extrusions, and (5) to report data for subject and nonsubject sources from India, Italy, Malysia, South Korea, and Taiwan. For detailed information on the adjustments for each table, see specific table source notes. Coverage figures on p. IV-2 are a comparison of import data provided in questionnaire responses to import quantities presented in table IV-2. The figure for Colombia results from the fact that the adjusted official import data (the denominator in the equation) subtracts a sizeable portion of the official import statistics for Colombia, such that questionnaire data is greater. Importer *** reported that many of its imports entered under the primary HTS numbers, including ***, were of out-of-scope merchandise. (continued...)

Seventy-three firms out of 110 reported that they confirmed their data was limited only to aluminum extrusions, regardless of if such extrusions entered with other components or not. While many firms provided detailed methodologies and descriptions of their efforts to isolate their data to refer just to aluminum extrusions, several firms reported difficulties with isolating the weight and value of just aluminum extrusions. *** noted that, “***.” Email from *** to Commission staff, September 5, 2024.

IV-19 Negligibility The statute requires that an investigation be terminated without an injury determination if imports of the subject merchandise are found to be negligible.6 Negligible imports are generally defined in the Act, as amended, as imports from a country of merchandise corresponding to a domestic like product where such imports account for less than 3 percent of the volume of all such merchandise imported into the United States in the most recent 12-month period for which data are available that precedes the filing of the petition or the initiation of the investigation. However, if there are imports of such merchandise from a number of countries subject to investigations initiated on the same day that individually account for less than 3 percent of the total volume of the subject merchandise, and if the imports from those countries collectively account for more than 7 percent of the volume of all such merchandise imported into the United States during the applicable 12-month period, then imports from such countries are deemed not to be negligible. 7 Table IV-5 presents information on imports from the subject countries in the most recent 12-month period for which data are available (i.e., October 2022 through September 2023). While imports from Colombia, Ecuador, India (subject), Italy (subject), Malaysia (subject), South Korea (subject), Taiwan (subject), Thailand, and United Arab Emirates were individually less than 3 percent of total imports in this period, these sources collectively accounted for *** percent in this period. 6 Sections 703(a)(1), 705(b)(1), 733(a)(1), and 735(b)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. §§ 1671b(a)(1), 1671d(b)(1), 1673b(a)(1), and 1673d(b)(1)). 7 Section 771 (24) of the Act (19 U.S.C § 1677(24)).

Critical circumstances On October 3, 2024, Commerce issued its final determinations that “critical circumstances” exist with regard to imports from United Arab Emirates of aluminum extrusions from Al Buraq, Al Hamad, Al Jaber, APC, Arabian Extrusions, Emirates Extrusion, Taweelah, and White Aluminum, and with regard to imports from Vietnam of aluminum extrusions with respect to the “Vietnam-wide entity”, but not aluminum extrusions from Vietnam produced or exported by East Asia and the non-individually examined separate rate companies that Commerce found qualified for a separate rate. 8 In this investigation, if both Commerce and the Commission make affirmative final critical circumstances determinations, certain subject imports may be subject to antidumping duties retroactive by 90 days from May 7, 2024, the effective date of Commerce’s preliminary affirmative LTFV determinations. Table IV-6 and figure IV-2 present these data concerning UAE.9 Tables IV-7 through IV-8 and figures IV-3 present these data concerning Vietnam. 10 8 89 FR 80472 and 89 FR 80530, October 3, 2024, referenced in app. A. When petitioners file timely allegations of critical circumstances, Commerce examines whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that (1) either there is a history of dumping and material injury by reason of dumped imports in the United States or elsewhere of the subject merchandise, or the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the subject merchandise at LTFV and that there was likely to be material injury by reason of such sales; and (2) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period. 9 ***. 10 ***.

Cumulation considerations In assessing whether imports should be cumulated, the Commission determines whether U.S. imports from the subject countries compete with each other and with the domestic like product and has generally considered four factors: (1) fungibility, (2) presence of sales or offers to sell in the same geographical markets, (3) common or similar channels of distribution, and (4) simultaneous presence in the market. Information regarding channels of distribution, market areas, and interchangeability appear in Part II. Additional information concerning fungibility, geographical markets, and simultaneous presence in the market is presented below. Fungibility Table IV-9 and figure IV-4, table IV-10 and figure IV-5, and table IV-11 and figure IV-6 present information on U.S. producers’ and U.S. importers’ U.S. shipments by alloy designation and by product type and finish. U.S. producers shipped in all alloy designations, with the largest share of shipments constituting 6061 or 6063 series alloys (***) percent, followed by other 6000 series and lastly by 1000, 3000, or 5000 series. Shipments of imports from subject sources included all alloy designations, with most shipments from most sources constituting 6061 or 6063 series alloys (*** percent for all subject sources).

V-1 Part V: Pricing data Factors affecting prices Raw material costs Raw materials decreased from approximately *** percent of the cost of goods sold (“COGS”) for aluminum extrusions in 2021 to *** percent in 2023. Additionally, raw materials as a percent of COGS decreased from *** percent in January-March 2023 to *** percent in January-March 2024. The primary raw material used to manufacture aluminum extrusions is aluminum, a commodity traded globally. The global price of aluminum increased from $0.91 per pound in January 2021 to $1.59 in March 2022. It then decreased to around $0.97 per pound in August 2023 before increasing to $1.01 in March 2024 (figure V-1 and table V-1). U.S. aluminum extrusions producers also purchase aluminum based on the Midwest premium all-in price of aluminum1 (described below), which followed similar trends (figure V-1 and table V-1).

Imports area based on the imports for consumption data series. Note: The estimated transportation costs were obtained by subtracting the customs value from the c.i.f. value of the imports for 2023 and then dividing by the customs value within each source. Note: Data presented are for the entire source with no subject vs. nonsubject breakouts for investigated countries. U.S. inland transportation costs Twenty-three responding U.S. producers and 65 importers reported that they typically arrange transportation to their customers, while seven U.S. producers and 16 importers reported that their customers usually do. Forty-five importers stated that they shipped from a storage facility, while 26 shipped from their point of importation. U.S. producers and importers described a similar range of U.S. inland transportation costs, with most U.S. producers reporting V-4 that their U.S. inland transportation costs ranged from 2.0 to 5.0 percent and most importers reporting costs of 0.5 to 5.0 percent. Pricing practices Pricing methods U.S. producers and importers reported setting prices using various methods, including transaction-by-transaction negotiations, contracts, and price lists (table V-3).

Note: Because of rounding, figures may not add to the totals shown. Both U.S. producers and importers described short-term contracts as generally having durations of 30-250 days. They also typically described long-term contracts as having durations of 2-3 years. Eleven U.S. producers and 12 importers indicated that their short-term contracts did not allow price renegotiations, while four U.S. producers and three importers indicated that such contracts did. Eight U.S. producers and six importers stated that such contracts fixed price and quantity, while six U.S. producers and seven importers stated that they fixed only price. Two U.S. producers stated that short-term contracts fixed only quantity. Thirteen of 15 responding U.S. producers and nine of 15 importers stated that these contracts were indexed to raw material (i.e., aluminum) costs. Nine U.S. producers and eleven importers indicated that their annual contracts did not allow price renegotiations, with nine U.S. producers and five importers indicating that such contracts did. Ten U.S. producers and six importers stated that such contracts fixed price and quantity, while seven U.S. producers and seven importers stated that they fixed only price. Two importers stated that annual contracts fixed only quantity. Eighteen of 19 responding U.S. producers and six of 14 importers stated that these contracts were indexed to raw material (i.e., aluminum) costs. Seven U.S. producers and five importers indicated that their long-term contracts did not allow price renegotiations, while six U.S. producers and eight importers indicated that such contracts did. Seven U.S. producers and two importers stated that such contracts fixed price and quantity, while five U.S. producers and six importers stated that they fixed only price. All 13 responding U.S. producers and 7 of 12 importers stated that these contracts were indexed to raw material (i.e., aluminum) costs. Fourteen purchasers reported purchasing products daily, 20 purchased weekly, and ten purchased monthly. Fifty-two of 54 responding purchasers reported that their purchasing V-6 frequency had not changed since 2021. Most (49 of 56) purchasers contact 1 to 10 suppliers before making a purchase. 2 Sales terms and discounts Regarding sales terms for aluminum extrusions, 21 U.S. producers and 38 importers typically quote prices on a delivered basis, while 14 U.S. producers and 45 importers typically quote prices on an f.o.b. basis. Thirteen U.S. producers and 50 importers had no discount policy. Eleven U.S. producers and 16 importers offered quantity discounts, while 14 U.S. producers and 14 importers offered total volume discounts. Four U.S. producers and 16 importers reported offering other forms of discounts, including early payment discounts, seasonal discounts, reorder discounts, and rebates to larger customers. Price leadership Thirty-five purchasers reported that there were no price leaders in the aluminum extrusions market, while 11 reported that U.S. producer Hydro Extrusions was a leader and three reported that U.S. producer Bonnell was a price leader. Other price leaders listed were Astro, Brazeway, Eastern Metal Supply, Extruded Aluminum, and Western Extrusions. Purchasers that described the presence of price leaders indicated that these leaders led due to their size and influence; for example, they explicitly described Hydro Extrusions as the largest supplier in the country. Additionally, purchasers described Hydro Extrusions’ extensive network of plants and large-scale operations as providing cost advantages that allow it to lead in pricing decisions. Furthermore, purchasers described Hydro Extrusions as initiating annual price increases, adding that other suppliers tend to follow suit once it sets its price. 2 Purchaser *** reported contacting *** suppliers, and purchaser *** reported contacting *** suppliers. Five purchasers did not report any information. V-7 Price data The Commission requested U.S. producers and importers to provide quarterly data for the total quantity and f.o.b. value of the following aluminum extrusion products shipped to unrelated U.S. customers during January 2021-March 2024. Product 1.-- Mullions and Split-Mullions, Anodized Finish, Unworked, Alloy in the 6000 series – Size: 1.75” x 3” to 3” x 8”, Weight: 0.6lb/ft to 7lb/ft.

Seventeen U.S. producers and 18 importers provided usable pricing data for sales of the requested products, although not all firms reported pricing for all products for all quarters.3 4 5 6 3 Per-unit pricing data are calculated from total quantity and total value data provided by U.S. producers and importers. The precision and variation of these figures may be affected by rounding, limited quantities, and producer or importer estimates. Product 1 consists of mullions, which are the vertical bars between the panes of glass in a window. 4 Petitioners raised concerns regarding the quarterly pricing data, with petitioners raising discrepancies and distortions in the pricing product data and concerns that the pricing product data price reflect characteristics not described in the pricing products. Petitioners posthearing brief p. 18; petitioners posthearing brief, Attachment A. 5 Respondents reaffirmed that the pricing data was robust and representative reflecting the price based on market conditions and demand. Mexican coalition Posthearing brief, pp. I-6-I-7. 6 To address concerns regarding pricing data reliability and issues, pricing data with significantly higher or lower average unit values underwent additional review with respondents for clarification and confirmation. Importers *** pricing data was either removed or adjusted, if pricing data were confirmed to include derived prices for aluminum extrusions from the sale of downstream products (importers ***).

Lost sales and lost revenue In the preliminary phase of the investigation, the Commission requested that U.S. producers of aluminum extrusions report purchasers with which they experienced instances of lost sales or revenue due to competition from imports of aluminum extrusions from subject sources during January 2020-July 2023. Twenty-eight U.S. producers submitted lost sales and lost revenue allegations. The 28 responding U.S. producers identified over 100 firms with which they lost sales or revenue (23 consisting of lost sales allegations and 21 consisting of either reducing prices or rolling back announced price increases). In the final phase of the investigation, of the 31 responding U.S. producers, 28 reported that they had to either reduce prices or roll back announced price increases, and 29 firms reported that they had lost sales. Staff contacted 52 purchasers and received responses from 56 purchasers. Responding purchasers reported purchasing approximately 3.0 million short tons of aluminum extrusions during January 2021-March 2024 (table V-15). Of the 55 responding purchasers, 36 reported that, since 2021, they had purchased imported aluminum extrusions from subject sources instead of U.S.-produced products. Thirty\u0002one of these purchasers reported that subject import prices were lower than U.S.-produced products, and 11 of these purchasers reported that price was a primary reason for the decision V-48 to purchase imported products from subject sources rather than U.S.-produced products (table V-16). Eleven purchasers estimated the quantity of aluminum extrusions from subject sources purchased instead of domestic products; quantities ranged from *** short tons to *** short tons (table V-17). Purchasers identified U.S. supply constraints, U.S. producers’ lead times, and quality as non-price reasons for purchasing imported rather than U.S.-produced products. Of the 35 responding purchasers, two reported that U.S. producers had reduced prices in order to compete with lower-priced imports from subject countries; seven purchasers reported that they did not know (tables V-18).

VI-1 Part VI: Financial experience of the U.S. producers Background1 Thirty one U.S. producers, all extruders, reported usable financial results and related information on their U.S. aluminum extrusions operations.2 Four U.S. producers (Bonnell, Hydro Extrusion, Hydro Precision, Kaiser), accounting for *** percent of the U.S. industry’s total 2023 sales quantity, are part of larger publicly traded companies.3 The remaining twenty-seven U.S. producers are privately held companies. The financial results presented in this and other sections of the report are primarily based on information from accounting systems designed to generate/report overall financial results on a U.S. GAAP or IFRS basis and were reported for calendar-year or equivalent periods.4 1 The following abbreviations may be used in the tables and/or text of this section: generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), fiscal year (“FY”), net sales (“NS”), cost of goods sold (“COGS”), selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A expenses”), average unit values (“AUVs”), research and development expenses (“R&D expenses”), and return on assets (“ROA”). 2 *** reported anomalous and/or incomplete financial results information in their final-phase U.S. producer questionnaires. While each company responded to staff follow-up questions, they were unable to resolve all identified data issues related to reported financial results. As a result, neither company is included in the financial results presented in the posthearing staff report. USITC auditor prehearing and posthearing notes. 3 Bonnell represents the Aluminum Extrusions segment of Tredegar Corp. Tredegar 2022 10-K, p. 1. Hydro Extrusion USA and Hydro Precision Tubing USA are both part of the Hydro Extrusions operating segment of Norsk Hydro. Norsk Hydro 2022 Annual Report, p. 132, p. 180.

Operations on Aluminum extrusions Table VI-1 and table VI-2 present income-and-loss data for U.S. producers’ overall operations on aluminum extrusions (combined other than CR extrusions and CR extrusions financial results). Table VI-3 presents a variance analysis of the financial results.5 Appendix H presents selected company-specific financial information related to overall operations on aluminum extrusions. 6 5 The Commission’s variance analysis is calculated in three parts: sales variance, COGS variance, and SG&A expenses variance. Each part consists of a price variance (in the case of the sales variance) or a cost or expense variance (in the case of the COGS and SG&A expenses variance), and a volume variance. The sales or cost/expense variance is calculated as the change in unit price or per-unit cost/expense times the new volume, while the volume variance is calculated as the change in volume times the old unit price or per-unit cost/expense. As summarized at the bottom of the variance analysis, the price variance is from sales, the cost/expense variance is the sum of those items from COGS and SG&A variances, respectively, and the volume variance is the sum of the volume components of the net sales, COGS, and SG&A expenses variances. The Commission’s variance analysis is more meaningful when product mix remains the same throughout the period. As noted in the Net sales section below, most U.S. producers indicated that their product mix did not change substantially during the period. 6 With regard to the two subsets of financial results making up overall aluminum extrusions financial results, Appendix J and Appendix K separately present financial results and related information for other (continued...)

As shown in tables J-1 and K-1, while average per short ton net sales value and raw material cost were highest in 2022 for both categories, other than CR extrusions and CR extrusions financial results were not uniform; e.g., other than CR extrusions operating income reached its highest level in 2022 and was positive throughout the period; CR extrusions operating income was at its highest level in 2021 and declined during the full-year period to an operating loss in 2023.

On a company-specific basis the pattern was mixed in 2022, largely uniform in 2023 (most U.S. producers reporting declines in sales volume) and mixed between the interim periods (only somewhat over half of U.S. producers reporting higher net sales volume in January-March 2024 compared to January-March 2023). Value The net sales value of aluminum extrusions generally reflects the combination of a pass through of primary aluminum costs (the metal component) and a conversion price.9 In sales contracts or other types of sales agreements, the metal component is adjusted on a monthly 7 ***.

As described by Bonnell’s parent company, “The purchase price of raw materials fluctuates on a monthly basis; therefore, Aluminum Extrusions pricing policies generally allow the Company to pass the underlying index cost of aluminum and certain alloys through to the vast majority of our customers so that we remain substantially neutral to metal pricing.” Tredegar 2023 10-K, p. 27. VI-7 basis to reflect the current LME price, which itself changes on a daily basis.10 Reflecting the underlying aluminum extrusion, as well as features such as the degree of fabrication and finishing, the conversion price attempts to incorporate/reflect the U.S. producer’s expected volume and associated manufacturing efficiencies over the period of the agreement.11 While U.S. producers indicated that the metal component of sales price and the actual cost of raw material usually wind up matching each other for the most part, there are periods when the two are less in sync.12 13 Bonnell’s parent company, indicating that inventory valuation and timing differences can have both positive and negative effects on financial results, stated in its first quarter 2024 10-Q that “. . . the timing of the flow through under the first-in first-out {inventory} method of aluminum raw material costs passed through to customers, previously acquired at higher prices in a quickly changing commodity pricing environment, resulted in a 10 Conference transcript, p. 124 (DeFrancesco). 11 Conference transcript, pp. 120-121 (Massey), p. 120 (Dillett), p. 122 (Adams). As described by a Bonnell company official, “The other thing to consider from sort of a bigger picture perspective is that you've got fixed costs, whether it's maintenance, insurance, overhead, taxes and so forth. Obviously, as the volume in a facility goes down, those costs on a per-order basis go up and have an impact on your conversion cost, notwithstanding the fact that you might have . . . offered that to the customer for a longer period of time on a price point.” Conference transcript, p. 122 (Hamilton). 12 ***.

As shown in the sales section of the variance analysis (table VI-3), the increase in total net sales value in 2022 reflects a large positive price variance, which more than offset a smaller negative sales volume variance. In contrast, the decline in the U.S. industry’s total net sales value in 2023 reflects the combined effect of a large negative sales volume variance and a somewhat smaller negative price variance. Lower net sales value in January-March 2024 compared to January-March 2023 reflects negative sales volume and price variances of similar magnitudes. On a company-specific basis, with some exceptions, U.S. producers reported the above noted pattern of higher total net sales value in 2022 followed by lower total net sales value in 2023 and between the interim periods. For the final phase of these investigations most U.S. producers confirmed that the directional pattern of average net sales value primarily reflects changes in the metal component of net sales value. 15 While for the most part noting the importance of the raw material pass through, several U.S. producers reported that changes in product mix impacted the pattern of their average net sales value. 16 In terms of average net sales value, U.S. producers noted pressure 14 Tredegar 2024 Q1 10-Q, pp. 20-21. ***. *** U.S. producer questionnaire, section III-10. ***. *** U.S. producer questionnaire, section III-10. 15 ***.

VI-10 they account for the majority of the U.S. industry’s overall net sales volume (73.7 percent in 2023). 19 Raw materials Raw material cost, the largest component of aluminum extrusions COGS, ranged from 59.0 percent of total COGS (January-March 2024) to 67.8 percent (2022). While ultimately reflecting costs primarily associated with aluminum and alloys, company-specific raw material costs vary according to level of integration: for integrated producers, purchased unalloyed aluminum and aluminum scrap and metallics generally account for the largest share of total raw material costs, while for non-integrated producers the primary raw material is purchased alloy aluminum billets. Aluminum scrap, which is generated at various stages of production, is generally remelted, if the U.S. producer is integrated, or shipped back to the billet supplier for an offset to billet price.20 Most U.S. producers, integrated and non-integrated, reported that they do not purchase material inputs and/or services from related suppliers.21 Generally tracking the market price of aluminum during the period, the U.S. industry’s total raw material cost increased to its highest full-year level in 2022, declined in 2023, and was lower in January-March 2024 compared to January-March 2023.

VI-11 increasing in 2022 and then decreasing in 2023 and between the interim periods (see table H\u00021). 22 Direct labor cost and other factory costs Direct labor cost, the smallest component of overall aluminum extrusions COGS, ranged from 10.0 percent of total COGS (2022) to 13.4 percent (January-March 2024). From an operational standpoint labor cost in general reflects various activities, including the upstream cast house, if a U.S. producer is integrated, extrusion press operations, common to all U.S. producers, as well as varying levels/types of fabrication and finishing. The U.S. industry’s average direct labor cost increased during the full-year period and was higher in January-March 2024 compared to January-March 2023. Covering a relatively wide range, the directional pattern of company-specific average direct labor cost reflects a combination of factors, such as higher wages and overtime pay and, in some instances, changes in product mix.23 24 Relatively high company-specific average direct labor cost, in other instances, reflects a U.S. producer’s extended start-up phase and low production levels, which also impacted the level of average other factory costs. While not directionally uniform, most U.S. producers reported increasing average direct labor cost throughout the period (see table H-1). Other factory costs, the second largest component of aluminum extrusions COGS, ranged from 22.3 percent of COGS (2022) to 27.7 percent (January-March 2024). 25 As a broad category 22 At the staff conference and in petitioner’s postconference brief, U.S. producers generally indicated that there was no widespread shortage or supply issue related to raw material, specifically aluminum, during the period.

Conference transcript, p. 51 (Kaplan). VI-12 other factory costs include a number of costs/expenses, which, in terms of their connection to underlying production or other relevant activity, can be variable, fixed, or mixed (possessing variable and fixed components).26 While integrated and non-integrated operations engage in many of the same production activities, integrated producers with cast houses, all things being equal, incur higher fixed costs as compared to non-integrated producers. 27 The U.S. industry’s average other factory costs increased during the full-year period and were modestly higher in January-March 2024 compared to January-March 2023 (see tables VI-1 and VI-2). On a company-specific basis most U.S. producers reported increasing average other factory costs during the full-year period but were more mixed between the interim periods (only somewhat over half reporting higher average other factory costs in January-March 2024 compared to January-March 2023). In addition to noting inflationary pressures, 28 U.S. producers indicated that the non-material components of COGS (i.e., direct labor cost and other factory costs) were impacted by company-specific changes in operations, such as reduced capacity utilization and corresponding lower fixed cost absorption,29 shifts in the size of aluminum 26 Most U.S. producers reported depreciation expense in other factory costs and to a lesser extent in SG&A expenses. In response to staff follow-up requests, those U.S. producers that originally reported depreciation expense in other expenses (i.e., below operating results) reclassified it to other factory costs.

VI-13 extrusions produced,30 smaller production runs and reduced efficiency, 31 and the start-up of new facilities. 32 Total COGS and gross profit or loss The directional pattern of the U.S. industry’s total COGS is generally explained by changes in both the U.S. industry’s average per short ton COGS, most notably changes in the raw material component, and net sales volume. As shown in the COGS section of the variance analysis (table VI-3), a positive volume variance (i.e., positive in the context of COGS and the variance analysis because sales volume declined (see footnote 5)) only partially offset the impact of higher average COGS in 2022, while the impact of lower average COGS was amplified by continued positive volume variances in 2023 and between the interim periods. Notwithstanding the decline in net sales volume in 2022, the U.S. industry’s corresponding total gross profit increased to its highest level of the period, reflecting an increase in total net sales value and a modest expansion in gross profit ratio (total gross profit or loss divided by total net sales value). While gross profit ratio again expanded somewhat in 2023, lower total net sales value yielded a reduction in total gross profit. Total gross profit was also lower in January-March 2024 compared to January-March 2023, reflecting the combination of lower overall net sales value and a contraction in gross profit ratio. In general, the absence of more pronounced swings in the U.S. industry’s gross profit ratio, and its inverse the COGS-to\u0002sales ratio, reflects percentage changes in average per short ton net sales value and COGS that were about the same throughout the period (see table VI-2). 30 ***.

Only somewhat over half of U.S. producers reported higher total gross profit in 2022 followed by a more pronounced number reporting decreases in 2023. Between the interim periods most (somewhat less than two thirds of U.S. producers) reported lower total gross profit in January-March 2024 compared to January-March 2023. SG&A expenses and operating income or loss The U.S. industry’s total SG&A expenses increased during the full-year period and were higher in January-March 2024 compared to January-March 2023. On a company-specific basis, the pattern was most uniform in 2022 (the substantial majority of U.S. producers reporting higher total SG&A expenses), mixed in 2023 (only somewhat over half reporting higher SG&A expenses), and again more uniform between the interim periods (somewhat over two thirds reporting higher SG&A expenses in January-March 2024 compared to January-March 2023). In conjunction with an increase in overall total sales net value, the U.S. industry’s corresponding SG&A expense ratio (total SG&A expenses divided by total net sales value) declined modestly in 2022. As total net sales value declined and SG&A expenses continued to increase, the SG&A expense ratio increased in 2023 and between the interim periods. On a company-specific basis most U.S. producers followed the above-noted directional pattern of declining SG&A expense ratios in 2022 followed by increases in 2023 and between the interim periods (see table H-1). Reflecting both the directional pattern of net sales value and corresponding expansions and contractions in operating income ratios (total operating income or loss divided by total net sales value), the U.S. industry’s total operating income increased to its highest level in 2022, declined to its lowest level in 2023, and was lower in January-March 2024 compared to January\u000233 ***.

VI-15 March 2023. 34 On a company-specific basis the pattern of operating results was mixed with most U.S. producers reporting their highest level of operating income in either 2021 or 2022; only several reporting their highest operating results in 2023. 35 The *** U.S. producer, ***, reported its highest operating income in 2022 followed by declines.36 While not directionally uniform, a substantial number of U.S. producers reported declines in their operating results in 2023. In January-March 2024 compared to January-March 2023 a large number (somewhat less than two thirds) also reported lower operating results. 37 Interest expense, other expenses and income, and net income or loss The U.S. industry’s operating income and net income shared the same directional pattern throughout the period: increasing in 2022, declining in 2023, and lower in January-March 2024 compared to January-March 2023. As compared to operating income, the lower level of net 34 Changes in the U.S. industry’s SG&A expense ratio had a modest impact on corresponding operating results: in 2022 the decline in the SG&A expense ratio amplified the positive effect of the increase in gross profit ratio; in 2023 the increase in the SG&A expense ratio more than offset the smaller increase in gross profit ratio; between the interim periods the higher SG&A expense ratio amplified the negative effect of lower gross profit ratio. 35 ***, which as noted previously reported *** throughout the period, and *** were the *** U.S. producers to report operating losses throughout the period. ***, substantially larger in terms of sales volume, reported operating losses for most of the period, the exception being 2021 (see table H-1).

VI-16 income reflects interest expense and other expenses, both varying in terms of their relative importance during the period, which were partially offset by corresponding other income. Most U.S. producers reported some level of interest expense during the period. 38 In contrast, a relatively small number of U.S. producers reported other expenses and other income, often identified as non-recurring items. The impact of other expenses and other income on overall net results was most notable in 2021: *** accounting for the largest company-specific shares of other expenses in that year; *** accounting the largest company-specific share of other income. 39 As a whole the U.S. industry generated net income throughout the period with most U.S. producers (somewhat less than two thirds) reporting net income of varying magnitudes, the remainder primarily reporting consecutive net losses for most of the period (see table H-1).

With regard to a company’s overall operations, staff notes that a total net asset value (i.e., the bottom line value on the asset side of a company’s balance sheet) reflects an aggregation of a number of current and non-current assets, which, in many instances, are not product specific. The ability of the U.S. producer to assign total asset values to a discrete product line affects the meaningfulness of calculated operating return on net assets. 41 Appendix J and K present total capital expenditures, R&D expenses, total net assets, and ROA related to other than CR extrusions and CR extrusions, respectively.

Total net assets remained within a relatively narrow range, increasing in 2022, then declining in 2023, but remaining above the level reported in 2021.

VII-1 Threat considerations and information on nonsubject countries Section 771(7)(F)(i) of the Act (19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(F)(i)) provides that— In determining whether an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of imports (or sales for importation) of the subject merchandise, the Commission shall consider, among other relevant economic factors1-- (I) if a countervailable subsidy is involved, such information as may be presented to it by the administering authority as to the nature of the subsidy (particularly as to whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement), and whether imports of the subject merchandise are likely to increase, (II) any existing unused production capacity or imminent, substantial increase in production capacity in the exporting country indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports, (III) a significant rate of increase of the volume or market penetration of imports of the subject merchandise indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports, (IV) whether imports of the subject merchandise are entering at prices that are likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and are likely to increase demand for further imports, (V) inventories of the subject merchandise, 1 Section 771(7)(F)(ii) of the Act (19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(F)(ii)) provides that “The Commission shall consider {these factors} . . . as a whole in making a determination of whether further dumped or subsidized imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of imports would occur unless an order is issued or a suspension agreement is accepted under this title. The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider . . . shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination. Such a determination may not be made on the basis of mere conjecture or supposition.” VII-2 (VI) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products, (VII) in any investigation under this title which involves imports of both a raw agricultural product (within the meaning of paragraph (4)(E)(iv)) and any product processed from such raw agricultural product, the likelihood that there will be increased imports, by reason of product shifting, if there is an affirmative determination by the Commission under section 705(b)(1) or 735(b)(1) with respect to either the raw agricultural product or the processed agricultural product (but not both), (VIII) the actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and (IX) any other demonstrable adverse trends that indicate the probability that there is likely to be material injury by reason of imports (or sale for importation) of the subject merchandise (whether or not it is actually being imported at the time).2 Information on the nature of the subsidies was presented earlier in this report; information on the volume and pricing of imports of the subject merchandise is presented in Parts IV and V; and information on the effects of imports of the subject merchandise on U.S. producers’ existing development and production efforts is presented in Part VI.

VII-37 Exports Table VII-13 presents Global Trade Atlas (“GTA”) data for exports of aluminum extrusions from subject countries to the United States and to all destination markets. In terms of value, exports from most investigated exporters to the United States were higher in 2023 than in 2021. Collectively, exports from combined subject exporters to the United States increased by 29.7 percent over this period. The largest increases during 2021–23 were from the UAE and Colombia, whose exports of aluminum extrusions to the United States increased by 128.2 percent and 115.8 percent, respectively. Conversely, over the same period, exports of aluminum extrusions to the United States declined from Malaysia, Indonesia, and Taiwan. China, Turkey, and Italy are the leading exporters of aluminum extrusions to all destination markets; combined, they accounted for over three-fourths (77.8 percent) of total exports by value in 2023. China alone accounted for over one-half (53.8 percent) of total exports by value in 2023. The United States was the primary destination for exports of aluminum extrusions from investigated exporters from several sources. During 2023, the vast majority of exports of aluminum extrusions by value from Mexico (99.1 percent), Colombia (95.2 percent), and Ecuador (89.1 percent) were destined for the United States. Almost one-half of exports of aluminum extrusions from Indonesia (48.3 percent) and India (46.5 percent) were destined for the United States during 2023.

India can generate renewable power, but without urgent upgrades to storage and transmission infrastructure, its clean energy ambitions risk stalling at a critical moment [Himanshu Ojha](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/author/himanshu-ojha) Updated on: 28 October 2025 6:16 pm Updated on: 28 October 2025 6:16 pm [SUBSCRIBE](https://subscriptions.outlookbusiness.com/default?_gl=1*xh9irm*_gcl_au*NDczNjgzMjM0LjE3NTEyOTMzMDQ.*_ga*MTcwMTQwMzY0MS4xNzQzNjkwODUw*_ga_EQ1QWF0GDN*czE3NTI2NzA2ODQkbzE1JGcwJHQxNzUyNjcwNjg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMjA0NDU4MDI1Mg..&userId=62f0aa5bcec7e365f6491e6d&referrarData=eyJ1c2VyU291cmNlRGF0YSI6Ik9USEVSUyIsInJlZmVycmVyIjoib3V0bG9va2J1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyZXJVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXRsb29rYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tLyJ9) Electricity Grid Electricity Grid Summary of this article - **Generation Outpaces Grid:** Over 50 GW of renewable capacity remains stranded due to inadequate transmission and delayed PPAs, despite India’s strong progress in clean energy generation. - **Transmission Bottlenecks:** Annual transmission expansion lags 40% behind targets, hindered by slow clearances, fragmented planning, and the geographical mismatch between generation and demand centres. - **Storage Shortfall:** India has just 205 MW of battery storage against a projected need of 411 GWh by 2032, making it impossible to shift surplus solar power to evening hours. - **Urgent Reforms Needed:** Achieving the 500 GW goal will require faster project clearances, coordinated Centre-state planning, and massive investments in both grid and storage infrastructure. India made impressive strides in renewable energy in recent years, with record capacity additions in recent years. However, the country’s power- transmission network has struggled to keep pace, leading to a clear gap between the generation and the evacuation infrastructure. The result? Over 50 GW of renewable energy capacity, enough to provide clean energy to 80-85 million households, cannot start operations and an extra 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide is being released daily into the atmosphere, all due to the lack of power cables and delays in the signing of power purchase agreements. [Follow our WhatsApp channel](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaFex3u0gcfHwT13lj1d) **The Ambition** Lapses on the transmission side can not only impact the environment and economic development, but also derail the country’s energy transition strategy. During the COP26 summit in 2021, India committed to installing 500 GW of non-fossil fuel based power capacity by 2030, with solar energy contributing the largest share at 280 GW, followed by 140 GW from wind power, with hydropower, bioenergy, and nuclear energy chipping in with the rest. So far, India’s progress has been significant. According to the latest data from Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), India’s non-fossil fuel capacity currently stands at 256 GW and is expected to reach around 300 GW soon, with over 40 GW of renewable energy projects in advanced stages such as signing power purchase agreements (PPAs) and securing transmission connectivity. Among the key drivers for this clean revolution have been advances in technology and scale that have helped drive down costs. “The cost of installing panels whether on rooftops or utility-scale plants has fallen dramatically over the years,” points out Gaurav Upadhyay, Energy Finance Specialist at Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). However, going forward, even the government acknowledges that maintaining this pace of growth will require an amended playbook. “In the last decade, India’s renewable energy capacity has grown more than fivefold, from under 35 GW in 2014 to over 197 GW (excluding large hydro) today. The next leap requires not just more megawatts, but deeper system reforms,” the MNRE Ministry said in a press statement this month. The challenges related to the transmission network stem from essentially three sources — delayed execution, fragmented planning and the fluctuating nature of renewable power generation. First, let us look at the last element — the fluctuating nature of power generation from renewable sources. [Govt Ramps Up Transmission Infra Construction to Meet India’s Growing Green Energy Demand](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/industry/govt-ramps-up-transmission-infra-construction-to-meet-indias-growing-green-energy-demand) BY [Outlook Business Desk](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/author/outlook-business-desk) **Grid Under Pressure** Designers of power transmission grids have always taken into account the need for a certain level of over capacity. This is because the demand for power varies significantly by the time of the day, and even season. For example, a grid catering primarily to a residential population may see peak demand in the evenings and summers, while an industrial area may see peak demand during day time. While historically, this cycle has primarily been demand led, the rise of renewables has led to the emergence of supply led fluctuations as renewables do not produce electricity at a uniform, or even predictable, pattern. Hence, on the days of high solar output, producers are often forced to curtail generation, leading to wasted energy and losses for developers. On the other hand, output can drop significantly on cloudy or rainy days, leading to underutilization of the grid and undersupply. Similar fluctuations are also seen on the grids connected to wind farms, with the variations connected to atmospheric conditions rather than insolation. According to Mercom Clean Energy Insights, since March 2025, nearly 4 GW of Wind-solar energy has been curtailed only in Rajasthan due to delays in transmission projects and lower power demand due to above-normal rainfall this year. It is therefore not surprising that India’s electricity grid infrastructure, designed decades ago for the steady supply generated by coal-based thermal power plants, is struggling to accommodate the variable and intermittent nature of renewable energy. A significant portion of renewable power often goes unused due to transmission bottlenecks and fluctuating demand, pointed out Upadhyay. “This oversupply has even driven daytime spot market prices into negative. India needs to ramp up its energy storage so excess solar power generated during the day can be stored and used later,” he added. Nikhil Nahar, Co-founder of SolarSquare, pointed out that operating a grid in today’s times has become far more complicated than it was in an era of predictable generation and demand, leading to the need for more sophisticated designs and advanced grid management tools. “This intermittency demands real-time balancing, flexible generation sources, and advanced forecasting tools—areas where India’s grid still lacks depth,” he noted. Compounding the challenge is the geographical mismatch between generation and demand. Much of India’s renewable energy is being generated in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, far from industrial demand centres such as Maharashtra, Delhi, and Karnataka. The mismatch between where power is produced and where it is consumed, which leads to evacuation difficulties, has become one of the most serious structural challenges in India’s energy transition. “Several auctioned renewable projects remain stranded as PPAs stall and transmission lags especially in Rajasthan and Gujarat, where 8-11 GW is stuck,” Upadhyay noted. **The Infrastructure Gap: Transmission and Storage** The second factor behind the grid’s inability to support the growth of renewable power is a lack of investment, giving rise to a widening infrastructure gap between the pace of renewable capacity additions and the development of supporting transmission and storage systems. Despite increased private sector participation under Tariff-Based Competitive Bidding, India’s overall transmission expansion has been slow and remains below National Electricity Policy targets. Annual transmission line additions have fallen short of planned levels since FY2019, with only FY2021 surpassing expectations. According to the recent _Transmission expansion trails renewable energy growth in India_ report by IEEFA and JMK Research: “In FY2025, 8,830 circuit kilometres (ckm) of new transmission lines were commissioned against a target of 15,253 ckm, representing a 42% gap, with Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) additions at their lowest in a decade.” “The challenge begins right from the planning stage of a transmission project,” said Vishal Tripathi, Former Public Policy Expert at NITI Aayog. “These assets often have to pass through forest areas, defence land, agricultural zones and commercial properties, each requiring multiple clearances and permissions from different authorities.” However, transmission is only part of the puzzle. The intermittency of renewables means that to complete the transition, the grid must be connected with energy storage facilities. However, this is also an area which is at its infancy in India. The country’s current installed capacity of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is at just 205 MW whereas, according to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) estimates, the country will need 411.4 Gigawatt-hour (GWh) of energy storage systems by 2031-32. Of this, around – 236.2GWh, is expected to come from battery energy storage systems (BESS) and the remaining 175.2 GWh from pumped-hydro storage plants. Upadhyay of IEEFA points out that we cannot move away from our reliance on thermal plants until we get this part of the puzzle right. “We don’t yet have enough storage to shift daytime solar power to evening hours.” [About 48 GW Inter-State Transmission System Network Completed for RE Evacuation: Govt](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/economy-and-policy/about-48-gw-inter-state-transmission-system-network-completed-for-re-evacuation-govt) BY [PTI](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/author/pti) **Policy and Institutional Bottlenecks** The third element hampering the growth of transmission capacity in India is gaps in planning. The CEA, the central government agency in charge of transmission, has prepared a detailed National Electricity Plan (Transmission) to build up 500 GW of renewable energy transmission capacity by the year 2030 and 600 GW by 2032. According to the plan, over 1.91 lakh ckm of transmission lines and 1,270 GVA of transformation capacity is planned to be added during the ten year period from 2022-23 to 2031-32 (at 220 kV and above voltage level). In addition, the inter-regional transmission capacity is planned to increase to 143 GW by the year 2027 and further to 168 GW by the year 2032, from the present level of 119 GW. However, what the plan fails to address is the key question of who will invest in these inter-state transmission networks. If the responsibility falls largely on DISCOMs, that would create major problems, because most of them are already under severe financial stress. By 2023–24, their cumulative losses had reached nearly ₹6.9 lakh crore, while their outstanding debt stood at around ₹6.8 trillion. “Power distribution companies need sufficient funds to ensure smooth operations and capital investment. Without sufficient financial resources, the reliability of power system is compromised,” said Karn Pallav, Head –Regulatory Affairs, BSES Rajdhani Power. [India Cancels Grid Access for 17 GW Renewable Projects as Demand Soars — Here’s Why](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/industry/india-cancels-grid-access-17gw-renewable-projects) BY [Outlook Planet Desk](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/author/outlook-planet-desk) Today, the situation is such that even if India installs 500 GW of renewable capacity, it won’t be able to transmit all the power where it is needed. Bridging this gap will demand unprecedented coordination between the Centre and the states, faster clearances for transmission projects, and a massive push to develop storage infrastructure. Some of the initiatives that can help in addressing the gap include a single-window clearance system to streamline approvals for land acquisition, right-of-way and grid connectivity, performance-linked incentives and disincentives based on asset utilisation and asset monetisation and public-private partnerships. In addition, the country has to set up massive energy storage systems in renewable-rich regions such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu and co-locate solar and wind plants with such systems. India's clean energy transition now hinges less on generation and more on storage and transmission. Without swift action, we risk derailing the green transition of the world's fastest-growing economy. ##### Related Content [L&T's Power Transmission & Distribution Vertical Bags Grid Infrastructure Orders in Middle East](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/corporate/lts-power-transmission-distribution-vertical-bags-grid-infrastructure-orders-in-middle-east) [Sembcorp to Acquire 100% Stake in ReNew Sun Bright for about ₹1,700 Cr](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/corporate/sembcorp-to-acquire-100-stake-in-renew-sun-bright-for-about-1700-cr) [Why Coal Continues to Rule the Grid](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/why-coal-continues-to-rule-the-grid) [India Cancels Grid Access for 17 GW Renewable Projects as Demand Soars — Here’s Why](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/industry/india-cancels-grid-access-17gw-renewable-projects) ##### Related Content [L&T's Power Transmission & Distribution Vertical Bags Grid Infrastructure Orders in Middle East](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/corporate/lts-power-transmission-distribution-vertical-bags-grid-infrastructure-orders-in-middle-east) [Sembcorp to Acquire 100% Stake in ReNew Sun Bright for about ₹1,700 Cr](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/corporate/sembcorp-to-acquire-100-stake-in-renew-sun-bright-for-about-1700-cr) [Why Coal Continues to Rule the Grid](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/why-coal-continues-to-rule-the-grid) [India Cancels Grid Access for 17 GW Renewable Projects as Demand Soars — Here’s Why](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/industry/india-cancels-grid-access-17gw-renewable-projects) Published At: 28 October 2025 6:16 pm [SUBSCRIBE](https://subscriptions.outlookbusiness.com/default?_gl=1*xh9irm*_gcl_au*NDczNjgzMjM0LjE3NTEyOTMzMDQ.*_ga*MTcwMTQwMzY0MS4xNzQzNjkwODUw*_ga_EQ1QWF0GDN*czE3NTI2NzA2ODQkbzE1JGcwJHQxNzUyNjcwNjg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMjA0NDU4MDI1Mg..&userId=62f0aa5bcec7e365f6491e6d&referrarData=eyJ1c2VyU291cmNlRGF0YSI6Ik9USEVSUyIsInJlZmVycmVyIjoib3V0bG9va2J1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyZXJVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXRsb29rYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tLyJ9) Tags -

In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

    "full_text": "SubscribeSign in # India's Grid Cannot Keep Up With Its Ambitions ### The digital economy is arriving faster than the physical grid can adapt to handle its demands. [Manish Singh](https://substack.com/@refsrc) Oct 07, 2025 25 [1](https://indiadispatch.com/p/india-grid-cannot-keep-up-with-its-ambitions/comments) 3 [Share](javascript:void(0)) India’s economic expansion and accelerating digitalisation are creating a surge in electricity demand that is exposing deep vulnerabilities in the existing power grid. The South Asian nation has committed to 500 gigawatts of non-fossil capacity by 2030, but the grid cannot yet reliably deliver clean power when and where it is needed. Supply will have to grow faster, be firmer and be more flexible than the system has ever delivered. If India captures a larger share of global data center investment driven by AI, this challenge will arrive precisely when the grid is least equipped to handle it. Goldman Sachs estimates that power required from utilities now needs roughly 7.2% annual growth between fiscal years 2025 and 2035, up from a prior 5.6%. The ratio of power growth to economic growth has been revised to roughly 1.06, versus roughly 0.85 before. Rising appliance ownership, electric vehicle charging and green-hydrogen pilots are pushing demand higher across the economy. The compute infrastructure supporting the digital economy is migrating from traditional IT rooms to industrial-scale data centres, creating a new and concentrated source of load that operates on a different scale than anything the grid has handled before. Hyperscalers say power is the first or second question in every investment decision when they evaluate potential data center locations. India’s data-centre base is still in the low single-gigawatts today, but Bernstein forecasts cluster around 5 to 6 gigawatts by 2030, provided interconnects and land clear on time. Jefferies’ top-end view reaches roughly 8 gigawatts, which at typical costs of 4 to 5 million dollars per megawatt implies 32 to 40 billion dollars of capital expenditure by decade-end. AI servers draw five to seven times the power of a legacy server rack, according to HSBC, creating disproportionate pressure on the grid. At scale, a 1 gigawatt campus needs roughly 1.3 to 1.5 gigawatts of constant supply depending on how efficiently the facility uses power, per Morgan Stanley. Power availability and connection queues now drive site selection as much as land price does, fundamentally altering the economics of where these facilities can be built. Data centres use only a sliver of India’s power today, but their share plausibly rises into the low single digits by fiscal year 2030 even in Nomura’s base case scenario. In a more aggressive scenario, consumption reaches 80 terawatt-hours, creating demand that would rival entire industrial sectors. Silicon wants electrons on a firm schedule that the current grid cannot reliably provide. India can construct utility-scale solar farms in 12 to 24 months (Mohit Bhargava, Senior Advisor to India Energy and Climate Center at UC Berkeley and former CEO of NTPC Green Energy said at a recent conference), which makes the renewable buildout look deceptively simple on paper. Reconciling that speed with the physics of electricity demand is proving harder in practice. Solar panels flood the grid when daytime demand is comparatively low, then fade precisely as households and commercial loads climb after 5 PM. On Goldman’s full-year models, the system runs a 1% to 4% energy deficit by fiscal years 2034 through 2035. Five-minute modelling of the peak week under adverse weather produces a deficit nearer 9%. This is not a morality tale about dirty versus clean energy sources but a timing problem that no amount of solar capacity alone can solve, no matter how many panels are installed or how quickly they are brought online. Coal plants can run around the clock and can ramp up production during the evening hours to meet surging demand. Legacy flexibility in the existing fleet complicates this seemingly straightforward solution in ways that limit how much solar the grid can absorb. Many Indian units struggle to operate at levels much below 60% to 70% of capacity, according to data shared by federal grid operator POSOCO. Operating at these minimum levels is crucial to keep the grid’s frequency stable, yet this makes it harder to absorb midday solar or respond to clouds passing overhead. Flexibility retrofits and revised operating norms matter as much as new megawatts in addressing this constraint, but the scale of the upgrades required is substantial. Assessments suggest India may need roughly 140 gigawatts of additional coal capacity by fiscal year 2035 versus 2023 levels. The government’s current target is roughly 87 gigawatts by fiscal year 2032. Some of this coal is bridge capacity to stabilise a faster-greening grid, not a repudiation of renewables, but the scale required exceeds what policymakers have publicly acknowledged or what most analysts expected even two years ago. Transmission infrastructure is the rate-limiter on the entire system, constraining how quickly renewable capacity can be added even when the generation itself can be built rapidly. The National Electricity Plan allocates about $110 billion for transmission through 2032, expanding the network from roughly 485,000 to roughly 648,000 circuit-kilometres and adding nine long-haul high-voltage direct current links totalling roughly 33 gigawatts. Typical interstate lines take 30 to 36 months to complete, and that timeline arrives before accounting for right-of-way fights and land acquisition disputes that routinely add years to the process. India’s present ability to move power through the system at high voltages is nowhere near what a continent-scale renewables-plus-data-centre system needs to function efficiently. Moving bulk power efficiently across regions will demand more substations, more support for maintaining stable voltage and more high-voltage direct current backbones than are currently funded or planned. The investment exists on paper, but the physical infrastructure lags years behind where it needs to be to support the generation capacity that is either already built or under construction. The constraints are already affecting major renewable developers in concrete ways. Reliance has land banks suitable for well over 100 gigawatts of solar capacity, but the ability to connect to the grid is the choke point affecting actual deployment of these projects. Its first 690 megawatt application at Khavda, a village in Bhuj Taluka of Kutch district, was granted connection capacity only by 2030, three years later than requested and larger blocks open from 2032 onward. Data-centre developers cannot sit in a transmission queue for years waiting for grid connectivity to materialize. They will gravitate toward firm electrons and existing infrastructure, not promises of future capacity that may or may not arrive on schedule. Energy storage is attempting to fill the gap between when solar generates and when demand peaks, but the scale required is enormous. Peak-week modelling suggests India could require roughly 530 gigawatt-hours of energy storage by fiscal year 2032, with about 420 gigawatt-hours plausibly delivered by batteries on current pipelines versus roughly 240 gigawatt-hours in government guidance. Battery pack prices have fallen roughly a third over the last two years, making solar-plus-storage economically viable for shifting midday power to early evening hours and covering short peaks that were uneconomic before. At multi-hundred-gigawatt-hour scale, supply chains, financing and siting still constrain deployment speed in ways that make it difficult to build fast enough. Storage is a powerful complement to transmission and flexibility, not a replacement for either, and it cannot by itself solve the problem of evening demand. Natural gas looks like a textbook bridge fuel on paper, offering the flexibility and reliability that the system needs. Except that cost and availability work against it in practice in the Indian context. Even under prospective liquefied natural gas gluts on global markets, gas-fired generation sits higher on India’s merit order than coal because of fuel pricing dynamics that have persisted for years. Image and projection: Goldman Sachs Gas will find a role as peaking capacity and locational reliability, especially where transmission infrastructure and urban substations are running at their limits, but it will not underwrite the nation’s evening ramp at scale on current economics. The math simply does not work at the volumes required to make a meaningful difference in the overall power balance. Time-of-day tariffs, interruptible contracts for large users and automated demand response can shave the peak and reduce the need for new generation capacity if deployed aggressively. These tools should be pursued because they can deliver results faster than building new plants or transmission lines and at a fraction of the capital cost. The political economy resists change in ways that make widespread deployment difficult. Distribution company finances are fragile, tariff reform is jagged and politically contentious, and enforcing sharp evening prices on voters is rarely a career-enhancing move for state governments that depend on those votes. Without that price signal, smart loads remain a pilot program rather than a resource at scale that can materially affect the peak demand problem. Institutions will decide the pace as much as technology does, determining which solutions can be deployed and how quickly they can scale. The Central Electricity Authority and Central Electricity Regulatory Commission set operating norms that determine how low coal plants can be run, how quickly they must ramp and what flexibility investments can be recovered through tariffs. State distribution companies control connection timelines and local capital expenditure decisions that affect every project. They also ration pain through load-shedding rather than pay for upgrades that stress their balance sheets and require politically difficult tariff increases. Land acquisition and right-of-way rules for the interstate transmission system pit national priorities against local politics and immediate constituent concerns in ways that delay projects for years. Open-access permissions, banking rules, and cross-subsidy surcharges tilt corporate buyers toward captive generation solutions instead of grid-beneficial ones that would help the broader system but offer less certainty to individual companies. China’s solution to data-centre load has been a coal-plus-renewables tandem buttressed by ultra-high-voltage transmission lines that move power thousands of kilometres across the country. The country built firm capacity and a long-haul backbone first, then stacked wind and solar behind it once the grid could handle the variability. It is not clean by any measure, but it is stable and predictable in ways that enable industrial planning. Texas offers a cautionary mirror on the other end of the spectrum: a torrent of wind and solar capacity, relatively light interconnections between regions, and a price-only market that invites curtailment and volatility during extreme weather events. That system is now being partly tempered by a wave of battery installations, but the integration challenges remain significant. India cannot copy either model wholesale given its own institutional constraints and geography, but the lesson is the same everywhere. Get the transmission infrastructure and the operating rules right before promising 24-hour clean power to compute campuses that require uninterrupted supply. Most commentary fixates on long-distance transmission lines as the primary constraint limiting renewable deployment. The near-term crunch may actually be distribution infrastructure at the local level, which receives less attention but creates immediate bottlenecks. Data-centre parks and peaking plants need substations at various voltage levels, high-capacity feeders, and fault-level upgrades inside cities already operating at thermal and political limits. Who pays becomes key in determining what gets built and when: developers via hefty connection charges, or distribution companies via capital expenditure they can barely finance given their debt loads and tariff constraints. Connection queues and local reinforcement requirements may add as much delay as the interstate lines that dominate public discussion, creating a two-tier bottleneck that affects different projects in different ways. Avoiding a false binary choice is essential when considering how much coal versus everything else the system needs to manage the transition. A plausible fiscal year 2035 mix that manages the evening peak includes several components working together in ways that complement rather than substitute for each other. A large block of new coal capacity operating flexibly during the 6 PM to 11 PM hours when demand surges past what renewables can provide. An upgraded legacy fleet with lower minimum operating levels to absorb midday solar without destabilising the grid’s frequency or forcing curtailment. Hundreds of gigawatt-hours of batteries shaving intraday swings and covering the first hour of the peak before other sources take over. A modest wedge of gas for location-specific reliability and fast start capability where transmission constraints prevent coal from serving certain areas. A growing contribution from time-of-day tariffs and demand response as state politics allow and distribution companies become more financially stable. The exact shares will move with prices, weather patterns and policy choices as the decade progresses, but the direction is clear regardless of which specific path policymakers choose. India will add coal to buy time for transmission, storage and demand-side tools to catch up with the modern economy’s arrival, even as it continues building renewable capacity at record rates. The digital economy is arriving faster than the physical grid can adapt to handle its demands. Transmission lines take years to plan, approve, and construct under the best circumstances. Solar panels go dark at the worst moment for system reliability, creating precisely the gap that needs to be filled. Batteries are powerful tools but not yet cheap enough at the scale required to make evening peaks disappear entirely, despite the dramatic cost declines of recent years. Hydroelectric plants and nuclear reactors face long lead times and public resistance that delay their contribution to the grid mix, often by a decade or more from initial proposal to operation. Given these timelines, the dependence on high-carbon baseload power will rise before it falls, creating a period where emissions may increase even as renewable capacity expands. Policymakers cannot pretend otherwise or deny the contradiction between clean energy goals and near-term infrastructure realities. Thanks for reading India Dispatch! Subscribe to receive new posts.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran.

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

Throughout its history, Indian traders and missionaries plying its waters for Malaysia and Indonesia brought Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism to the region with them. Those ties have lingered into the present, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has touched upon their shared cultural and religious connections through soft power diplomacy as part of his government's Act East policy....

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

    "full_text": "1 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 COUNTRY UPDATE: I UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 October 2024 By Sema Hasan, Senior Policy Analyst Increasing Abuses against Religious Minorities in India Introduction Religious freedom conditions in India have continued to worsen throughout 2024, particularly in the months prior to and immediately following the country’s national elections. In addition to the enforcement of discriminatory state-level legislation and propagation of hateful rhetoric, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government made a concerted effort to implement election promises that negatively and disproportionately impacted religious minorities and their ability to practice their faith. Such promises included enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), inaugurating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and introducing a national code to replace religion-specific personal laws. Each action was justified by government officials as necessary to protect India’s “cultural [and] linguistic heritage”—a common euphemism for Hindu supremacy, often at the expense of religious minorities. This report provides an overview of the various religious freedom violations that have taken place in India during 2024. It focuses on changes to the country’s legal framework, including the strengthening of discriminatory legislation like state-level anti-conversion and anti-terrorism laws, as well as the implementation of the CAA and the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). It also examines the increasing frequency of attacks against religious minorities and their advocates, including the targeting of places of worship. Laws and Other Challenges to Religious Freedom at the National Level The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) In May 2024, the Indian government published the rules for implementing the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), fulfilling a long-anticipated BJP campaign promise. Amending the country’s 1955 Citizenship Act, the CAA established a religious criterion for fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants (from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, or Christian communities) fleeing neighboring Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The law excludes Muslim refugees, including Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka. The act states that an individual must have lived or worked in India prior to December 31, 2014, in order to apply for citizenship. www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov Stephen Schneck Chair Eric Ueland Vice Chair Commissioners Mohamed Elsanousi Maureen Ferguson Susie Gelman Vicky Hartzler Asif Mahmood Meir Soloveichik Erin D. Singshinsuk Executive Director USCIRF’s Mission To advance international freedom of religion or belief, by independently assessing and unflinchingly confronting threats to this fundamental right. 2 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Critics argue that the CAA violates the Indian constitution’s principles prohibiting religious discrimination and its guarantees of equal protection under the law. Mass protests followed the initial announcement in 2019, in which hundreds were injured and thousands arrested—some of whom remained in detention as of September 2024, including Umar Khalid, Meeran Haider, and Sharjeel Imam. The recent announcement of the implementation rules initiated a surge of new protests as well as a number of petitions challenging the CAA before the Supreme Court. Several Indian states have expressed opposition to the CAA. In 2019, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh all moved resolutions against the CAA. In February 2024, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu stressed that he would not allow implementation of the CAA in that state, as he would “stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan brethren.” Similarly, in March, the chief minister of West Bengal voiced her opposition to the act, arguing that it would be used to “turn legal citizens into foreigners.” Kerala was the first state to legally challenge the CAA and in March renewed its 2020 plea before the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the law’s classification based on religion and country is discriminatory. In June, the Madhya Pradesh government granted Indian citizenship to three applicants under the CAA. National Register of Citizens (NRC) Human rights advocates argue that the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in combination with the CAA, would allow the Indian government to expel those it deemed noncitizens, posing particular risk to the country’s Muslim population. The government first piloted the NRC in Assam in 2018, when it sought to separate Indian citizens from “undocumented immigrants” living in that state. The NRC requires residents to prove they or their ancestors had entered Assam prior to March 24, 1971, or face exclusion from the register. In 2019, the Assam government published its list of names of those it considered Indian citizens according to the NRC, omitting 1.9 million names. Of these 1.9 million, an estimated 700,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Bengali Hindus, and 200,000 were from the Assamese Hindu groups Koch-Rajbongshi, Das, Kalita, and Sarma. In July 2024, the Assam government ordered police to cease referring people entitled to Indian citizenship— under the CAA—to Foreigners’ Tribunals, which function as quasi-judicial bodies that authorities task with determining whether an individual is a “suspected foreigner.” Despite this order, police in Assam that same month, in conjunction with the Foreigners’ Tribunals, declared 28 Muslims as “non-citizens” and sent them to a deportation center. In September, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that all individuals must submit an NRC application in order to receive identity cards. New Delhi India USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 3 Expropriation and Demolition of Places of Worship and Muslim Property Since the beginning of 2024, Indian authorities have facilitated the expropriation of places of worship, including the construction of Hindu temples on the sites of mosques. Most notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in January, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Indian authorities had constructed the temple atop the ruins of the Babri Masjid, which a Hindu mob had demolished in 1992 in their belief that it marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site was long contested; India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the mosque’s destruction was an “egregious violation” of the law and yet granted the site to Hindus while offering Muslims a separate plot of land to construct a new mosque—which remains unbuilt as of September 2024. The days following the temple’s January 2024 consecration were marked by a series of attacks and other instances of intolerance against religious minorities across six states. In each instance, violence erupted following Hindu nationalist processions through predominantly Muslim neighbors. In Maharashtra, violence broke out along Mira Road, where police stood by as mobs vandalized dozens of Muslim-owned shops. Several reports indicate that the police arrested Muslim youths, despite receiving dozens of complaints against the actions of the Hindu mob. In the aftermath of the Mira Road violence, municipal authorities returned with bulldozers to demolish structures they deemed illegal. Commonly referred to as “bulldozer justice,” state authorities have repeatedly used bulldozers to demolish Muslim property under the guise of removing “illegal” structures, including homes, businesses, and places of worship. In February, for example, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the 600-year-old Akhoondji Mosque, alleging that the building was an illegal encroachment. The mosque’s imam argued that he did not receive written notice before the demolition. The DDA has also announced its intention to demolish 20 religious structures in the forested areas of Sanjay Van, including 16 Muslim shrines. A court order claimed that Delhi “already had sufficient dargahs and temples” and that the forest needed restoration. The same month, in Uttarakhand, the demolition of a mosque and Muslim seminary by police and government officials sparked deadly clashes and an internet shutdown. In July, the DDA demolished the Faizyab Mosque and Madrassa in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area. Places of Worship Act Beyond demolitions, the government has expropriated several mosques for alternative purposes, directly violating India’s Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. The 1991 act froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed in August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith. While the act does not apply to the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, it extends protection to all other places of worship. Despite this law, an Indian court ruled in February that Hindus can worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, which Hindus claim rests on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The same month, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav called for the repeal of the Places of Worship Act, calling it “unconstitutional.” Waqf Amendment Bill In addition, many Muslims have expressed concern regarding the Indian government’s introduction of the Waqf Amendment Bill in August, which seeks to repeal the 1995 Waqf Act. A waqf is an endowment (movable or immovable) that Muslims can give for a specific pious or charitable purpose, according to Islamic tradition. Once registered as a waqf, such property—which may include land, graveyards, or buildings—is deemed nontransferable and held in perpetuity as such. All mosques in India are considered waqf properties, under the management of Muslim bodies in every state, known as Waqf Boards. The 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to broaden the government’s regulatory authority over these endowments and proposes the mandatory inclusion of non-Muslim members on Waqf Boards. It also seeks to prohibit the designation of a given property as a waqf based on its owner’s oral declaration alone. Legal experts and Muslim leaders argue that these provisions would erode their community’s autonomy over its own religious institutions. The introduction of this legislation follows the increased proliferation of disinformation regarding the distribution of wealth among India’s Muslim communities, including derogatory comments that Prime Minister Modi made during the national election. 4 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 State and Local Laws Impacting Religious Minorities Uniform Civil Code and Personal Status Laws Since 2019, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have articulated their intention to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to overrule existing personal laws that are highly integrated with religious beliefs. Such personal laws include areas such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession. Critics argue that a UCC would contradict secular principles while failing to adequately represent the needs and values of the country’s myriad and diverse religious communities. In February, the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand passed a state-level UCC bill, establishing a uniform set of rules on personal status law that includes marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. This bill is widely considered to represent a template for other states to adopt. The UCC sets the minimum age for marriage at 18. While Hindu and secular laws set age restrictions for men and women, there are no such limitations for Muslims and other communities. Some Muslim communities have characterized the UCC as a threat to Islamic practices, preferring to observe Shari’a as the basis for personal law, and some Sikh organizations have similarly rejected it, arguing that it “undermines Sikh identity.” The UCC further requires “live-in” relationships to be registered within a month and establishes criminal punishments, including six months in jail, for failing to do so. Such provisions would allow for further policing of interfaith couples, who already face risks including threats of violence from family members. In July, for example, the Uttarakhand high court directed police to provide protection to an interfaith couple in a live-in relationship and instructed them to register under the UCC. The couple reported receiving threats from their parents about their relationship. Anti-Conversion Laws In addition to the UCC and other legislation, authorities frequently used state-level policies throughout the first part of 2024, including anti-conversion laws, to target religious minorities across India. As USCIRF previously reported, 12 of India’s 28 states currently maintain anti\u0002conversion laws and enforce them to varying degrees. These laws prohibit conversion under circumstances that far exceed cases of coercion, and they are often punishable by hefty fines and prison terms. Authorities frequently enforce such laws under the pretext of preventing so-called “love jihad”—a conspiracy theory that claims Muslim men target and seduce Hindu women for conversion to Islam—while in effect targeting interfaith relationships. Since the beginning of the year, authorities have arrested dozens of Christians on allegations of conducting or participating in forced conversions. In June, for example, police in Uttar Pradesh detained 13 Christians, including four pastors; in July, seven Christians faced accusations of violating the state’s anti-conversion law in two separate incidents. That same month, government officials from Uttar Pradesh tabled a bill that would strengthen the state’s anti-conversion law, including expanding the punishment for conversion to life imprisonment, allowing anyone to file a First Instance Report (FIR) against suspected violators, and making religious conversion a nonbailable offense. Several other states made similar efforts to introduce or strengthen existing anti-conversion laws. In February, for example, the state of Chhattisgarh announced it would introduce legislation to address “illegal conversion,” claiming that Christian pastors had forcibly converted Hindus. In February, the Assam government passed the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Bill, which bans individuals or groups from performing “non\u0002scientific” healing, such as prayer, to treat illnesses. The chief minister of Assam further noted his intention to restrict Christian evangelism and conversion in the state with the bill. In April, the government of Gujarat issued a circular mandating that Hindus wishing to convert to Buddhism, Sikhism, or Jainism obtain approval from their district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. In June, the BJP-led government in Rajasthan withdrew its 2008 anti-conversion law in favor of new legislation aimed at “curbing alleged cases of ‘love jihad’” and religious conversion. Additionally, as of August, appeals challenging the constitutionality of anti\u0002conversion laws were pending in seven states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Anti-Cow Slaughter Laws India’s constitution directs states to take steps to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, considered sacred in Hinduism. As a result, 20 of India’s 28 states currently enforce anti-cow slaughter laws. Vigilante groups and self-proclaimed “cow protectors” frequently exploit such laws to target religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits. USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 5 An estimated dozen attacks involving “cow vigilantism” took place following India’s national elections in June. In August, for example, a group of cow vigilantes beat a Muslim migrant worker to death, falsely accusing him of having eaten beef. A day later, a group of Hindu men violently attacked a 72-year-old Muslim man because they believed he was carrying beef in his bag. The same month, a group of “cow protectors” shot and killed a 19-year-old Hindu student because they thought he was a Muslim smuggling cows. While arrests were made in each of these cases, perpetrators of such attacks often operate with impunity; they rarely face punishment and are often released on bail within 24 hours. Other Significant Religious Freedom Challenges across India Hate Speech, Misinformation and Disinformation In the leadup to the June 2024 elections, political officials increasingly wielded hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims and other religious minorities. Prime Minister Modi repeatedly claimed that the opposition party would “wipe out [the] Hindu faith from the country” and had plans to make Hindus “second class citizens in their own country.” He perpetuated hateful stereotypes about Muslims, referring to them as “infiltrators.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah echoed these statements and insisted falsely that opposition leaders would impose Shari’a if elected—despite the fact that the opposition election manifesto included no mention of Shari’a or Muslims. Additionally, misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech by Indian government officials frequently fuel and incite cow vigilantism and other attacks against religious minorities. The attacks against Muslims in Mira Road following the inauguration of the Ram Temple in January, for example, erupted following inflammatory speeches by two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain. Rane reportedly openly threatened the Muslim community, using offensive language and urging the Hindu community to “ignite and retaliate.” While First Instance Reports (FIRs) were filed against Rane and Jain, Mumbai police argued in July that the use of terms like “jihadis,” “Rohingya,” and “Bangladeshis” were not aimed at the Muslim community and therefore did not fall under Section 295A of the penal code. The same month, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about an increase in hate speech targeting Rohingya refugees and the Indian government’s role in arbitrary mass detention and forcible return of that community to Burma. Following Rane and Jain’s speeches, BJP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) T. Raja Singh gave a 40-minute speech in February stoking religious tensions, in which he openly called for violence against Muslims and for the further demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura. Singh claimed that Muslims were facilitating the forceful conversion of Hindus and repeatedly referred to Rohingya and Bangladeshi Muslims as “illegal.” He encouraged his audience to be “prepared to fight for the protection of our country and religion” and to fight against “love jihad,” forced conversion, and cow slaughter. Attacks against Religious Minorities In March, a group of UN experts raised alarm about the level of violence and hate crimes against religious minorities in the leadup to national elections, including vigilante violence, targeted and arbitrary killings, demolition of property, and harassment. They called on the Indian government to fulfill its obligation to prohibit religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and violence. From January to March 161 incidents of violence against Christians in India were reported—47 of which occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh. Such incidents ranged from violent attacks on churches and prayer meetings to physical assaults, harassment, and false allegations of forced conversion. Muslims continued to be targeted, as well. In March, a group of Hindus in Gujarat violently attacked foreign Muslim university students as they gathered for prayer during Ramadan. The university subsequently issued new guidelines, instructing students not to pray in common spaces. Moreover, following the election results, during which the BJP lost its national majority, at least 28 attacks against Muslims occurred from June to August. Religious educational institutions were also subjected to harassment and targeting. In February, for example, Hindu organizations entered a Catholic school in Assam and demanded instructors cease using Christian images and symbols. In March, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment striking down a previous ruling on the governance of madrasas, effectively banning Islamic schools in that state and ordering the public school enrollment of students whom the closures had impacted. 6 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Crackdown on Civil Society and Faith-Based Organizations In 2024 the government of India has expanded its tactics of repression to target religious minorities and their advocates abroad. Journalists, academics, and civil society organizations documenting India’s religious freedom violations have reported facing denial of consular services, including the revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards as well as threats of violence and surveillance. In April, international reporting linked an official in India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to the 2023 assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist in New York. Additionally, Indian authorities have repeatedly used discriminatory legislation to target religious communities and those advocating on their behalf. Authorities continued to exploit antiterror and financing laws, including the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to crack down on civil society organizations, religious minorities, human rights defenders, and journalists reporting on religious freedom. The UAPA was enacted in 1967 but amended in 2019, allowing the government to designate individuals as “terrorists” without due process. The law vaguely defines “unlawful activity” as any action “intended to disrupt India’s sovereignty, integrity or security,” including “disruptive speech.” In 2024, several religious minorities and human rights activists have continued to face detention without trial under the UAPA, including Hany Babu and Rona Wilson. Academic and human rights activist GN Saibaba, whom authorities detained under the UAPA in 2017 for criticizing state violence against religious minorities, was ultimately released in March but described how police had abused him, tortured him, and denied him medical care while in custody. Similarly, organizations that document and advocate for religious freedom continue to face harassment and, in some cases, are forced to shut down operations. Like the UAPA, authorities have used India’s Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to obstruct the work of civil society organizations. FCRA regulates access to foreign funds for individuals and organizations and prohibits receipt of foreign funds for “any activities [deemed] detrimental to the national interest” of India. The law requires nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to apply for FCRA licenses to received foreign funding, but authorities can readily revoke such licenses. In April, India’s Home Ministry canceled the FCRA licenses of five NGOs, preventing them from using existing funds. Those NGOs included the Church of North India (CNI) Synodical Board of Social Service, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, and Evangelical Fellowship of India. In total, the Indian government has canceled over 20,000 FCRA registrations since 2012. Replacing India’s Criminal Code In July, the Indian government moved to replace its colonial-era criminal laws with three new laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA). These laws replaced the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1872 Indian Evidence Act, respectively. Human rights groups argue that the enforcement of these new laws may have exacerbated the targeting of religious minorities and their advocates. Such legislation may pose an additional threat to freedom of expression, association, and right to a free trial, particularly for religious minorities. The BNS specifically adds a new provision criminalizing “acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India” and increases the minimum punishment from three years to seven. It also expands the criminalization of the promotion of “enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion” to include electronic communications. Reporting indicates that this provision has already served as a pretext for targeting journalists who reported on an alleged mob lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh. The BNSS additionally allows for police to seek 15-day detention of an accused individual at any time before they have completed 40–60 days of the allowed remand period. UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief. Professional Staff Michael Ardovino Policy Analyst Susan Bishai Senior Policy Analyst Mollie Blum Policy Analyst Guillermo Cantor Director of Research and Policy Elizabeth K. Cassidy Senior Strategic Advisor Mingzhi Chen Supervisory Policy Advisor Patrick Greenwalt Policy Analyst Sema Hasan Senior Policy Analyst Thomas Kraemer Chief Administrative Officer Veronica McCarthy Public Affairs Associate Hilary Miller Policy Analyst Nora Morton Operations Specialist Dylan Schexnaydre Policy Analyst Scott Weiner Supervisory Policy Analyst Luke Wilson International Legal Specialist Kurt Werthmuller Deputy Director of Research and Policy Nathan Wineinger Chief of Public Affairs Jean Wu Policy Analyst Conclusion Religious freedom conditions in India continue to follow a deteriorating and concerning trajectory. The Indian government continues to repress and restrict religious communities through the enforcement of discriminatory legislation like anti-conversion laws, cow slaughter laws, and antiterrorism laws. In doing so, authorities have arbitrarily detained individuals highlighting violations of religious freedom, including religious leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, without due process—in some cases for years. Indian officials have repeatedly employed hateful and derogatory rhetoric and misinformation to perpetuate false narratives about religious minorities, inciting widespread violence, lynchings, and demolition of places of worship. In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in particularly severe religious freedom violations. This report further outlines a number of policy recommendations that the U.S. government can take to address religious freedom violations in India, including issuing targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, conditioning arms sales based on improved religious freedom conditions, and incorporating religious freedom priorities into bilateral meetings with Indian government counterparts.",

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Organizations like the VHP are on the upswing as Hindu nationalism grows in India. (NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen from politically sensitive targets, and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents from the Offices of the Dalai Lama, and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing sensitive information on citizens of numerous third party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business information, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while operating core servers located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and motivation of the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some of the associations of the attackers through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an eight month, collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and SecDev) and the Shadowserver Foundation. The investigation employed a fusion methodology, combining technical interrogation techniques, data analysis, and field research, to track and uncover the Shadow cyber espionage network.

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

Equity securities may fluctuate in value and can decline significantly in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions. Bonds generally present less short-term risk and volatility than stocks, but contain interest rate risk (as interest rates raise, bond prices usually fall); issuer default risk; issuer credit risk; liquidity risk; and inflation risk. These effects are usually pronounced for longer-term securities. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Currency Risk is a form of risk that arises from the change in price of one currency against another. Whenever investors or companies have assets or business operations across national borders, they face currency risk if their positions are not hedged. Generally, among asset classes, stocks are more volatile than bonds or short-term instruments. Government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate short-term price fluctuations than stocks, but provide lower potential long-term returns. U.S. Treasury Bills maintain a stable value if held to maturity, but returns are generally only slightly above the inflation rate. © 2025 State Street Corporation - All Rights Reserved.

The 46th ASEAN Summit, convened on May 26, brought together leaders from the ten-member bloc and produced a new five-year strategic plan aimed at deepening economic integration among member states, with goals such as further harmonizing trade standards, enhancing financial integration and promoting sustainable economic practices.
