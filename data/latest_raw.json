[Articles](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/recent) India’s Prime Minister identifies the Maoist (or “Naxalite”) insurgency as India’s “single biggest internal security challenge.” The insurgency is today severe in scale and violence with 2,212 violent incidents in 2010 causing 1,175 casualties (713 civilian, 285 security force and 171 guerilla), a 63% increase since 2008. [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn1) Today, about 10,000 – 40,000 full-time insurgents wage a protracted peoples war to overthrow the Indian state across a vast “Red Corridor,” affecting 20 of India’s 28 states. India is currently waging a large-scale counterinsurgency campaign against the Maoists, deploying 70,000 paramilitary police in November 2009, many to the insurgent heartland in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, where 50 percent of all attacks were recorded in 2010. [\\[ii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn2) The Maoists benefit from “two Indias living side by side.” [\\[iii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn3) India is rapidly modernizing, but many inequalities are also widening – between rich and poor, town and country and upper and lower castes. Conditions for large swathes of rural India still compare with the worst of sub-Saharan Africa, and in many remote areas the state has long been absent. However, economic grievances alone do not correlate with Maoism, and in net terms, the Indian state has tremendous internal legitimacy – only 26 of India’s 100 poorest districts, and 20 of its 100 most illiterate are Maoist afflicted. [\\[iv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn4) In truth, Maoist legitimacy is restricted to the extreme end of India’s deprivation scale – amongst the adivasis (tribals) and dalits (“untouchables”) – where in addition to extreme human misery, a broader set of social and status grievances are being inflamed. Analyst Eric Randolph astutely noted on the issue that, “People can put up with a great deal of structural violence in their lives \\[…\\] particularly when it is all they have known. Instead, what tends to trigger acts of violent rebellion are specific flashpoints of injustice.” [\\[v\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn5) For the adivasis and tribals, there are plenty such flashpoints. India’s tribals – in particular the Gonds of Central India [\\[vi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn6) – are under intense assault from state and private corporate interests, and are being pushed off their forestlands by giant hydro, logging and mining projects for little compensation and rehabilitation. The dalits, already the bottom rung of landless agricultural farmers, are similarly disproportionately impacted by the tumultuous changes of modernization on the Indian countryside, and discriminated against daily despite legislation. Tribals make up the core fighting strength of the Maoist insurgency – their narrow eight percent share of the population is still sizeable given India’s 1.2 billion peoples. The Maoist insurgency follows on a long history of peasant and tribal rebellion against predatory state structures on the subcontinent. It originated in its present form in a small village in Naxalbari, West Bengal, where in 1967, villagers armed with bows and arrows resisted police and feudal landlords with bows and arrows. [\\[vii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn7) The incident galvanized the Indian Communist movement, which found a fertile audience for its Chinese-inspired Maoist rhetoric of land reform and overthrow of feudal class structures. Militant Communism has since waxed and waned for the past half century, crushed by security forces and de-legitimized by the Indo-Chinese War of 1962, but the current phase of escalation is the strongest and most violent in history. In 2004, the two largest insurgent groups – the People’s War Group and the Maoist Communist Center – merged to form the new Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI-M). The merger elevated security hardliners in insurgent command, reiterated their commitment to violent and large-scale “peoples war,” and immediately increased insurgent kinetic activity. Today, the CPI-M accounts for 90% of attacks and 95% of fatalities from “left-wing terrorism,” according to the Indian Home Ministry. [\\[viii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn8) Maoist insurgents are tactically effective and intimately familiar with their jungle terrain. They employ classic guerilla tactics, dispersing in the face of organized force and prioritize their links with the population –often through violent intimidation. Their dispersed organizational structure mitigates the risk of being decisively impacted by targeted counterinsurgent (CI) operations. Local cells have tremendous autonomy, reflected in the fact that since 2007, six of the fourteen members of the Politburo, the highest echelon of insurgent command, have been arrested, to little discernible impact in the field. [\\[ix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn9) Unusual in COIN campaigns, Maoist guerillas have the tactical advantage over Indian security forces, and have demonstrated the ability to conduct sophisticated large-scale operations. Insurgents assault training centers and police stations to capture weaponry, attack jails to break out captured comrades and target judges and state functionaries to weaken state presence. Their lethality has grown with the use of IEDs, which now result in the majority of CI casualties. Despite a total lack of external support, the Maoists have ready access to funding – territories under their control are resource-rich and the insurgents maintain an extensive and lucrative extortion network that may net them as much as 14 billion rupees ($300 million) annually. [\\[x\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn10) Part of the insurgent “tax” is explosives used in the mining sector, which companies are often in no position to refuse. [\\[xi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn11) **A Military-Centric Response** India has grown acutely aware of the Maoist threat, but the effort to date remains vastly inadequate, both in mobilizing capacity and in implementing policy. The current counterinsurgent (CI) strategy is typically Indian – manpower-intensive and enemy-centric. It emphasizes building up force numbers to “saturate” areas with government forces and prioritizes kinetic action to suffocate the insurgency by attrition. Only lip service is paid to Western-style population-centric strategy; CI forces are present to target insurgents, not secure the population. The resultant flood of ill-trained and ill-equipped soldiers conducting large-scale sweep and commando operations has exposed civilian populations to collateral damage and abuse, increased Maoist legitimacy and recruitment, and left populations open to reprisal attacks by insurgents. As such, it likely that the scale and intensity of violence will increase in the short-term, but over the longer-term, the sheer mass of government capacity may tip the balance. Even so, brute military force is unlikely to ever fully extinguish an insurgency that is driven primarily, if not exclusively, by social and status grievances. In India’s federalist structure, states assume primary responsibility for combating Maoism, but their inadequacy has forced central “paramilitary” police forces to assume the leading COIN role. “Operation Green Hunt” launched in November 2009 deployed about 70,000 Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF) personnel (split roughly evenly between combat and support staff) to reach a 2011 end-strength of 73 battalions across Maoist-affected states. [\\[xii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn12) The CRPF is India’s largest internal security force and is a resource provider of sorts for the central government – sending emergency infusions of armed police to insecure areas across the country. [\\[xiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn13) The nomenclature of “paramilitary” typically attributed to the CRPF may overestimate its true capabilities – it is nowhere close to being a specialized CI force. [\\[xiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn14) In Kashmir, some CRPF units received intensified resourcing and training allowing them to independently secure key terrain districts, [\\[xv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn15) but in net terms, the CRPF is subject to all the problems of the Indian police sector including chronic shortfalls of equipment, training, leadership, and logistical and administrative support. It struggles in basic constabulary operations – let alone open combat against a tactically proficient insurgent on home terrain. Symbolic of the challenge, some CRPF units’ still lack protective vests, even while deployed in frontline combat roles! [\\[xvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn16) For anti-Maoist operations, the CRPF is supported by other state armed police forces, i.e. those state police units trained for higher grade law and order problems, including India Reserve Battalions (IRB). These forces are more competent than the regular police, but there is generally a net decline in combat capacity, discipline and professionalism down the hierarchy of security institutions. Scale, capacity and terrain challenges severely hamper the CI force. 70,000 troops cannot by themselves realistically expect to affect any measurable difference over a population of at least 450 million people across 1.86 million square kilometers of tough, remote terrain [\\[xvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn17) – especially without adequate support from effective civil police for regular law and order functions. The UN recommends a peacetime police-to-population ratio of 222 policemen per 100,000 members of the population, which India – and especially its insurgency-affected areas – falls far short of. [\\[xviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn18) In the Maoist heartland of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, new figures show their police-to-population ratios at 226 and 206 in 2010, [\\[xix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn19) a dramatic improvement (at least on paper) from 2000, when the ratio was a mere 50! [\\[xx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn20) Other states lag far behind. Orissa remains at 136, West Bengal at 100, and Bihar at just 74. [\\[xxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn21) Numbers tell only part of the story. Indian police are notoriously corrupt and brutal by Western standards. Draconian sedition laws punish even the semblance of sympathy for the Maoist cause, [\\[xxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn22) and anti-Maoist operations regularly leave behind a trail of destruction – including serious abuses such as torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions and rape. [\\[xxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn23) In the field many units – other than some elite forces – are tactically outmatched. Maoists benefit from the guerilla’s ability to choose the time and place of engagement, allowing them to confront the state at its weakest points. Coordinated attacks have penetrated high-security areas with relative impunity, but most notable was the 2010 Maoist ambush in Dantewada that killed 76 soldiers of the 62nd CRPF Battalion, the single largest loss of life in Indian COIN history. The event deeply undercut the Indian government’s claims of progress, and revealed systemic failures. 62 Bn. had served previously in anti-Naxal operations in Bihar, but like other CRPF units was shifted in an ad hoc manner on the basis of availability rather than suitability for the mission. As a result, it failed to acclimatize to the local physical and human terrain, evident when the force found itself trapped on a narrow jungle path. An IED was able to halt the entire column by disabling the lead vehicle, and well-positioned guerillas prevented any retaliatory maneuver. [\\[xxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn24) Chronic deficiencies in leadership were also evident – not uncommon in a force that sees its best officers poached by other agencies. [\\[xxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn25) The unit commander reportedly lied about his position to avoid a long-range field patrol, and failed to report a lost radio that likely allowed guerillas to track to column over several days. [\\[xxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn26) Insurgent intelligence dominance was easily evident – the Maoists were able to maneuver 1,000 men into place without detection, no doubt benefiting from at least some local support. Dantewada was an exceptional incident, but there are a legion other equipment and training challenges that limit CI abilities. Drastic expansion in force size has come without a commensurate emphasis on building up an adequate support base. Troops are barracked in terrible living conditions and there is widespread resentment at the perceived lack of political support, as well as the lack of clarity and resources with which to conduct their missions. Force protection is low, especially against IEDs. Deployed counter-IED equipment is limited [\\[xxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn27) and current armored vehicles provide inadequate protection, forcing a reliance on vulnerable dismounted patrols. New armored vehicles are being introduced – but Maoists have generally adapted by increasing the size of their bombs. [\\[xxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn28) Unsurprisingly, morale is low. One soldier angrily declared to an embedded reporter, “Have you ever seen a war being fought like this? We don’t know if we are here to assist the state police on law and order or to flush out Naxals, or merely to oscillate between troubled territories, getting our jawans (soldiers) killed for no fault of theirs.” [\\[xxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn29) He went on to point out various shortcomings including inadequate and sporadic rations, virtually no support for injured and killed soldiers, and points out that even “when I go on leave or when I am on my way back home \\[from camp\\], I travel that distance at the mercy of God or the Naxals. What morale are you talking about?” [\\[xxx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn30) Despite their tactical capabilities, Maoists adhere to classic guerilla tactics, readily ceding territory in the face of organized state offensives, even “liberated areas” such as Lalgarh district. Their mobility and trans-bordered nature allows them to exploit weak intra-state cooperation, making border areas between states particularly troublesome. Some states such as Chhattisgarh have multiple tri-junctions – where the borders of three states meet – allowing insurgents to mount attacks across state lines before retreating to safe havens. [\\[xxxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn31) Success in one state – such as Andhra Pradesh – may only displace insurgents into others; the neighboring states of Orissa and Chhattisgarh have seen significant spikes in violence since. Several initiatives have been unveiled to overcome the jurisdictional conflicts that plague effective trans-border policing, most notably by creating unified commands in insurgency-affected states. Designed to act as ‘fusion centers’ to facilitate cooperation between states, between state and federal forces, and between civilian and military personnel, their result has so far been underwhelming, not least because of the pushback from many state and local governments. On the local level, a political-criminal interface ensures that many politicians are eager to collude with Maoists and profit from their control of mines and resources. In some states – such as Jharkhand and Bihar – political rivalries mean that states refuse to cooperate with federal efforts, and in others, leaders collude with the Maoists for self-preservation. In West Bengal, the state government has greatly slowed CI activity and all but allowed a Maoist sanctuary earning them greatly reduced levels of violence in the state, but damaging the overall COIN effort. [\\[xxxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn32) The easy availability of central forces has also resulted in many states neglecting their own police modernization efforts. Unsurprisingly, simply augmenting force numbers has not paid dividends. Chhattisgarh and Jharkand both saw insurgent attacks rise despite a police surge, whereas in Andhra Pradesh, the state which has most effectively combated Maoists, the police force in population terms remained constant. Credit for reversing insurgent momentum is generally given to the state’s elite ‘Greyhound’ force built to live and operate in the jungle as the guerilla did, and fight the Indian jungle equivalent of a “bush war.” The force’s 1,000 personnel across 30 “assault units,” benefited from rigorous training and superior equipment (particularly communications technology) and were able to rapidly deploy and effectively operate on Maoist terrain. The Greyhounds have been extremely effective, but they did not operate in a vacuum. Beyond elite forces, Andhra Pradesh pursued an effective state police capacity-building effort, spreading tactically trained personnel across the force, and building synergistic relationships between the district police, intelligence assets and the Greyhounds. [\\[xxxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn33) The state also benefited from focused efforts to improve its COIN doctrine. It coordinated police strategies, created fortified police districts in vulnerable areas, improved intelligence sharing between security agencies, [\\[xxxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn34) cross-trained regular police units with elite police commando forces, and measurably implemented well-crafted community development programs. Unfortunately through the militarized lens of India’s COIN campaign, only the warfighting elements of Andhra Pradesh’s strategy have been replicated with earnest. The CRPF is raising ten Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (COBRA) battalions to reach an envisioned end-strength of about 10,000 men. [\\[xxxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn35) COBRA battalions are expected to be some of the best-equipped paramilitary troops in the country, and are trained specifically for the Maoist fight. They are armed like a regular Army infantry platoon and are trained in counter-guerilla and jungle warfare operations at the elite Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS), the Indian Army’s premier unconventional warfare training institution. State police forces – such as the India Reserve (IR) battalions are also are tasked with raising two companies of specialized ‘commando’ forces per battalion [\\[xxxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn36) \\- and more state police forces are being given at least some advanced warfare training. This militarization of the police may yield results in terms of removing insurgents from the field, but comes with the tradeoff in diverting attention and resources away from the equally crucial task of increasing and professionalizing regular policing capacity to “hold” cleared territory. Another worrying trend has been the outsourcing of security responsibilities to auxiliary non-state militias that operate with little oversight, training or accountability, and yet are deputized under the aegis of ‘Special Police Officers’ (SPOs) with official government sanction. Most prominent was the Salwa Judum (literally translated to “Purification Hunt” in the local Gondi dialect), a Chhattisgarh government-sponsored and equipped militia of about 5,000 lightly armed tribal people. Salwa Judum may have benefited from support and funding from mining companies, and was widely accused of extreme human rights abuses including forcible displacements of villages, killings and rape. In response, in July 2011, the Indian Supreme Court declared SPOs illegal and unconstitutional and ordered their disbandment. Indian security officials had routinely justified these forces as helping them ‘localize’ their force presence, build up human intelligence networks and provide alternative employment opportunities for tribal youth. They came, however, with substantial tradeoffs including the militarization of tribal society and the emergence of ‘warlords’ who maintain control over refugee camps and swathes of territory – making disbandment and reintegration difficult. [\\[xxxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn37) However, despite their record, SPOs did provide an important “force multiplier” for culturally foreign CI forces, and their replacement with regular police will take time – by some accounts at least a year. [\\[xxxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn38) Moreover even if SPOs are abandoned fully – itself a dubious prospect – other shadowy vigilante groups also exist, including the several “Cobra” organizations in Andhra Pradesh that retaliate against Maoist violence, particularly if committed against military and government officials. [\\[xxxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn39) As detailed, Indian CI forces suffer many capacity shortfalls that impede their operational effectiveness, but major reforms are currently ongoing that could significantly increase the quality of anti-Maoist CI forces. Israeli assault rifles are being purchased, [\\[xl\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn40) helicopters being redeployed back from peacekeeping missions ostensibly for anti-Maoist operations, [\\[xli\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn41) and retired army soldiers being recruited as trainers. [\\[xlii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn42) Two of three sanctioned UAVs have been inducted to improve ISR capabilities and detect massed insurgent forces – although forested terrain restricts their utility [\\[xliii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn43) \\- and a variety of other new equipment is being inducted. All these if utilized effectively can improve the CI capacity to kill insurgents, but it is less certain that they can strategically end the insurgency. **Inadequate Social, Political and Economic Redress** The Indian state has focused on combating the insurgency by military means, but addressing the legitimate economic and social grievances of tribal peoples has been less forthcoming. Rural development in India comes with significant scale challenges, affecting 1/3rd of the entire world’s poor and traversing remote areas where the government has traditionally been absent. Improving tribal welfare is a component of the broader growth and modernization of India, and as such competes with a host of other priorities. Development projects come with sizeable time-lags that must be factored in – effective policy will require sustained funding and attention over a period of years without immediately apparent results. Development must be recognized for the offensive weapon that it is – both in attacking insurgent legitimacy and in binding tribals to the Indian state by destroying their earlier forms of social existence. [\\[xliv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn44) Moreover, it is not a panacea. Efforts to raise economic and human welfare standards must come alongside broader reforms in social justice and local governance to mitigate predatory and corrupt local administrative structures. It is not for nothing that the insurgent heartland in Chattisgarh and Jharkhand corresponds with the two worst governed states in the country. [\\[xlv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn45) Tighter regulation of private industry is also necessary, including measures to ensure rehabilitation for those displaced by mining projects, and efforts to compensate for and mitigate the ecological and social impacts of extraction. India has admittedly prioritized rural development – elevating its ministry to a cabinet level position in 2011 – and significantly increased allocations to Maoist-affected areas through targeted entitlements. However, rural development to date has been superficial and ineffective, with emphasis on increased allocations obscuring problems in implementation and a lack of progress towards desired outcomes. The Maoist Integrated Action Plan for example provided 250 million rupees in 2010, and 300 million in 2011 in discretionary funds for quick-impact human welfare projects including building facilities for drinking water, sanitation, health clinics, roads etc. Data to date, however, suggests that only a quarter of allocated money has been spent and only 15 percent of projects completed. [\\[xlvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn46) This is despite the obvious fact that sincere development is appreciated – in February 2011 the Maoist abduction of a district collector known for being an efficient and honest administrator led to tribal rallies and protests, forcing his release [\\[xlvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn47) There is, however, a prevalent belief that current patterns of insecurity dictate that stabilization must precede development. This is not an unreasonable view – it is obviously difficult to develop territory you do not control and the Maoists recognize that development can erode their control. As such, insurgents have targeted 1,241 ‘economic targets’ between 2007 and 2011, including roads, power plants, telephone towers etc. [\\[xlviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn48) Such targeting is entirely self-interested, seeking to keep communities isolated and insulated from the relief efforts and ensuring that Maoists are the sole providers of social services. Human Rights Watch for example details how Maoists shut down rural schools to create captive recruiting pools for their Bal Sangam child-brigades. [\\[xlix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn49) Government agents are prime Maoist targets, severely complicating outreach. CI forces have attempted to mitigate this problem by recently unveiling plans for seven new battalions of “specialized forces” that integrate engineering and security personnel. [\\[l\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn50) There are islands of success, but overall reconstruction and aid delivery efforts in Central India leave much to be desired. Plans look good on paper; the Saranda Action Plan for example seeks to build on successful clear operations with a series of entitlement plans – including issuing ration cards for the poor, creating rural work schemes and developing infrastructure to connect isolated communities. [\\[li\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn51) Unfortunately, many of these policies fail to be implemented effectively and a large proportion of allocated funds are leaked to inefficiency, corruption and the incompetence of the state machinery. Corruption in particular is not a side effect that can be ignored – the nexus between corrupt politicians, private industry and Maoists is a key driver of both tribal alienation from the state, as well as a major facilitator of insurgent freedom of action. Much development money is also believed to flow to Maoist hands in the form of protection money paid by reconstruction firms. **Lessons Learned** 1) Skewed priority of effort – The mission fails to integrate military and civilian efforts, and prioritizes tactical military decisions that may in many cases have strategic tradeoffs. Development and political outreach is tainted by police brutality, and ineffective military operations are a major driver of Maoist mobilization. Military missions must be designed and conducted carefully to minimize civilian alienation, and must be viewed as precursors for post-“clear” development and reconstruction. Civilian and military coordination must improve and emphasis must be placed on improving the conduct of security forces. 2) Over-Militarization of Police – The emphasis on building up paramilitary forces capable of taking the fight to the Maoists should not detract from efforts to build up competent civil police. Kinetic operations must be merely a prelude to a viable rule of law, which will require building up capacities in not just the civil police, but also the supporting justice and detention sectors. 3) Mobilize Scarce Assets – The Indian Army has rightly assessed that it is not trained or equipped to combat its own people, but it is the only Indian institution with the specialized capacity that could tip the Maoist fight. Aerial assets can improve ISR coverage, equipment such as counter-IED kits and armored vehicles can reduce police casualties, and Army trainers and facilities are the best available resource to build up small-unit combat capabilities and disseminate tactical lessons learnt from other theaters. 4) Improve unity of effort – The insurgency crosses borders, and so must the CI effort. Focus must be given to improving coordination between the many state and central agencies involved, and between states. The goal should be to create effective border management protocols that prevent insurgents from locating safe havens to regroup. 5) Attack insurgent legitimacy – CI actions should best sell their mission, but strategic communications can highlight Maoist complicity in corruption, extortion, and violent abuse at the expense of tribal communities. This is most viable if CI forces themselves adhere to tighter ethical codes of conducts than insurgents – not currently true. 6) Empower non-state actors with care – Actors such as Salwa Judum deeply de-legitimize the state and taint it by association. Especially in India, the population cannot easily distinguish between police branches or between formal and informal forces, and brutalities reinforce the predominant image of the Indian state as callous and predatory. 7) Improve the effectiveness of aid delivery – There must be a focus on outcomes over allocations. Emphasis should be paid on ensuring that projects are completed on time and to standard, and continual oversight should mitigate leakages. Projects should be visible and have immediate impact, and local communities must be involved from project design to completion. 8) Governance reform – Corruption and local predatory state structures are drivers of Maoist legitimacy and mobilization. A major facilitator of the insurgency is the willingness of local politicians to collude with Maoists and/or private industry at the expense of their constituents, and to enact self-interested policies that weaken the mission. Measures such as the sedition laws would be better suited to tackle direct support such as this, rather than human-right workers and ordinary civilians whose only crime is to extend moral support. 9) Aid is insufficient – Aid and quick-impact projects can only alleviate immediate needs. Broader economic and social reforms must be tackled with real urgency. A culture of impunity and blatant corruption must end; for politicians, police, and business elites, and inequalities between rich and poor and town and country must ease. Targeting Maoist-affected areas with increased funding and attention is probably good policy, but it is likely not an overstatement to say anti-Maoist success will correlate significantly with India’s progress in caring for its poorest peoples. * * * [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_ednref1) “Annual Report 2010-2011,” _Ministry of Home Affairs Republic Of India_, Available at [www.mha.nic.in](http://www.mha.nic.in/); “2010 bloodiest year for India’s Maoist rebellion,” _AFP,_ January 5, 2011.

This amorphous group of self-proclaimed \"Maoist\" revolutionaries known collectively as Naxalites was dedicated to the armed overthrow of the existing system of government. Their use of violence taxed the resonrces of the security forces. The Naxalite movement contained several often-competing organizations that were tied together only by common rejection of the existing social and gcvernmental systems in India and reliance on violence to achieve their goals. T he Naxalite movement has evolved through three separate phases in India. The first phase ran from the late 1960s through 1973. The second phase occurred from the late 1970s through 1994. The third and most significant phase formally began in 2004, reaching a peak of violence from 2005 to 2011 and declining to a nadir in 2014. The modus operandi of the Naxalites typically consisted of organizing the very poor and the landless and goading them into acts of terrorism or the forceable occupation and cultivation of land held usually by large, but sometimes by small landowners. Peasants were encouraged to \"annihilate\" class enemies and to engage in other activities to \"render ineffective the state apparatus\" in their areas. The Naxalites refuse to participate in the parliamentary process and denounce all groups, including other Communist parties, that do. In their thinking, \"the only way to achieve liberation is by force of arms to overthrow the four main enemies -- US imperialism, Soviet social-imperialism, their bureaucratic,and bourgeoise lackeys, and the feudal landlords.\" The number of India's youthful, educated unemployed continued to increase, and, paradoxically, the success of the \"green revolution\" in agriculture pointed up the growing disparities between landed peasants who were benefiting from better harvests and poor peasants whose prospects for acquiring land were practically nil. Both students and peasants had become increasingly impatient with the unfulfilled promises of the traditional political parties and, by the same token, are more easily seduced by the call to violent revolution and the immediate, tangible rewards it seems to offer. The Naxalites made a calculated effort to demolish national heroes - Mahatma Gandhi in particular - as a demonstration of their contempt for \"bourgeois ideas.\" These iconoclastic actions plus their hit-and-run tactics and their spectacular exploits -- bombings; murders; book burnings; attacks upon police stations, movie houses, and libraries -- gave the Naxalite movement newspaper headlines from which it derived both inspiration and new recruits. In December 2020, the Chhattisgarh government reported that 216 Maoist fighters were killed in the state over the course of three years, and 966 surrendered. A battle in India�s central Chhattisgarh state left 22 security personnel dead and 31 wounded, according to police. The Times of India (TOI) newspaper, meanwhile, reported that 32 were injured and one officer was missing following the firefight. According to the TOI, more than 2,000 officers went on an anti-Maoist raid on 02 April 2021. The government force included elite CoBRA jungle warfare unit, which is part of the police. On September 15, 2011, news media reported that the Indian Union Home Minister stated that left-wing extremism (Naxalism) is the most violent movement in the country and that the Communist Party of India (CPI Maoist), the primary Naxalite group, is the most violent organization in the country. The Naxalites have a long history of conflict with state and national authorities, including frequent attacks on local police, paramilitary forces, and government officials. Inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Tse-tung, the insurgents, called Naxals, have been fighting in eastern and central India for decades, demanding more jobs and resources for farmers and the poor, using violent acts including bombings, and hit and run attacks against authorities. India�s Maoist groups have their roots in the peasant movement of Andhra Pradesh following independence, but were later radicalized with the introduction of Maoist ideologies. Several groups merged in 2004 to form India�s Maoist Communist Party, which seeks to overthrow the government and bring about their definition of a classless society. Although that group is banned, India has several other communist parties that are regularly elected to positions in parliament and the legislature. Since the Maoist/Naxal threat was not secessionist, but rather one of law and order the police and state governments, and not the military, bore the responsibility for addressing the challenge. The military could, and is, working on a limited basis with the police in an advisory or training capacity, but they are not involved in active, kinetic operations. However, the military is monitoring the threat to ensure that it does not get out of hand. Disputes over land and natural resources are pervasive in India. The courts are clogged with unsettled land disputes. In the eastern and northeastern states of India, conflicts over forests and agricultural lands have their roots in longstanding inter-communal, ethnic and separatist conflicts. In Scheduled Tribes \\[ST\\] areas, disputes related to the illegal alienation of ST land to non-tribal people are common. In several central and northeastern states, large companies have purchased land and mineral rights from state governments, which has contributed to the growth of a well-armed Maoist insurgency known as the Naxalites. In India today there are many Maoist parties and organizations that either predate the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) or emerged from factions when the CPI-ML split after the death of Charu Majumdar. Three of them, the CPI-ML (People's War), CPI-ML (Party Unity), and the Maoist Communist Center (MCC), are currently engaged in armed struggle. An inter-connected \"Naxalite belt\" stretches across central India, comprising Bihar, MP, Orissa, AP, Maharashtra and parts of Tamil Nadu. Those parts which were connected to the neighboring states came under the influence of Naxalism. Its members are called Naxalites after the eastern Indian town of Naxalbari, where their movement originated in 1967. The 25 May 1967 peasant uprising at Naxalbari in Darjeeling district of West Bengal began under the leadership of revolutionary communists belonging to the Communist Party of India - Marxist \\[CPI (M)\\]. The uprising was brutally suppressed by the CPI (M)-led United Front government of West Bengal at the behest of the Congress government at the Center. In reaction, communist revolutionary ranks rebel against the leadership of the party. The rebellion soon assumes an all India dimension. Entire state units of CPI (M) in Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir and considerable sections in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh joined this rebellion. On 22 April 1969 they formed the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). Since 1980 clashes between police and Naxalite Maoist revolutionaries have taken place in northwestern Andhra Pradesh. In areas under their control, Naxalites dispense summary justice in \"people's courts\" which in some cases condemn to death suspected police informers, village headmen, and others deemed to be \"class enemies\" or \"caste oppressors.\" The Naxalites extort money from business firms, and railway services in one area had to be canceled in July and August due to PWG destruction of stations, track and signaling equipment. Over the past few years, hundreds of policemen and suspected Naxalites have been killed, according to press reports and human rights organization. As of September 1998 police had killed 102 Naxalites in approximately 80 \"encounters.\" Decades of guerrilla-style conflict have led to serious human rights abuses by both sides. Human rights groups allege that \"encounters\" are usually faked by the police to cover up the torture and subsequent murder of Naxalite suspects, sympathizers, or informers. These groups cite as evidence the refusal of police to hand over corpses of suspects killed in \"encounters,\" which are often cremated before families can view the bodies. Andhra police have contributed to the establishment of an armed vigilante group known as the \"Green Tigers,\" whose mission is to combat Naxalite groups in the state. The NHRC is investigating some 285 reported cases so-called \"fake encounter deaths\" allegedly committed by the Andhra police in connection with anti-Naxalite operations. Between 1999 and 2001, several hundred deaths a year were attributed to Naxalite/ government fighting and activities. The revolutionaries sought to carve out a \"Compact Revolutionary Zone\"; however their efforts were suppressed by the Indian and Nepalese governments. In February, 2002 the Home Ministry held several rounds of talks with the state government of Andhra Pradesh and a representative of the Peoples War Group. In June 2002, the group withdrew from those talks following a police encounter. By May of 2003, tensions seemed to ease. The Naxalite revolutionaries had not been violently active in the preceding 4 months, and the Indian Government appeared committed to implementing the 1997 act which stipulated improvement for the Naxalite population. The government decided to reduce the number of police forces in the area, and agreed to unconditional talks with the revolutionaries. An assassination attempt against Chief Minster Naidu of Andhra Pradesh marked a serious downturn in the peace process and PWG and the police to step up their activities. In 2004 a government three month long cease-fire and a temporary lifting of a ban of the PWG failed to result in a long term peace agreement. More than 500 people were killed in 2004 in sporadic low-intensity conflict. 2004 also marked an important political development in the Naxalite movement. During the final months of 2004 the PWG merged with the Maoist Communist Center of India, creating the Communist Party of India (Maoist), becomming the largest Maoist rebel group with operations in over 9 states. This group also stepped up cross border relations with Nepal's Maoists. In the wake of the breakdown of the peace process between the PWG and the Andhra Pradesh state government in 2004, the fighting between government and Naxalite forces increased in 2005. While the fighting remained low-intensity and sporadic in nature, over 700 people were killed, a third of whom were civilians. In 2005 the Chhattisgarh state government enacted the Special Public Security Act (SPSA), which permits detention for as long as three years for loosely defined unlawful activities. Human rights groups voiced concerns that the law criminalizes any support given to Naxalites (Maoists), even support provided under duress. In July, 2006 violence between Naxalites and government forces increased significantly. On July 17, an armed group of approximately 800 Naxalites attacked a relief camp in Dantewada killing at least 25 people and wounding 80 more. It is believed that the Naxalites staged their attack from the Andhra Pradesh state. The relief camp targeted provided shelter to over four thousand internally displaced persons. Four Naxalites were reportedly killed in retaliatory fire. On July 23, 2006 in what was claimed as a major blow against Andhra Pradesh Naxalite forces, the Naxalite leader of the Andhra Pradesh state was killed in a raid along with seven other people by police in the Prakasam district. From 2002-2006 over three thousand people had been killed in Naxalite-goverment conflicts. In central and eastern India, armed conflicts between Naxalite (Maoist) insurgents and government security forces over land and mineral resources in tribal forest areas continued, affecting 182 of the country�s 626 districts in 20 of its 28 states. Most of the conflict areas overlap with the Dandakaranya forest, which covers parts of West Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The forest also has large deposits of mineral resources, such as bauxite, iron ore, and uranium, and is home to millions of tribal persons. The Ministry of Rural Development in 2009 estimated that up to 400,000 persons had been displaced since the conflict began. During the year �Operation Green Hunt,� the government�s initiative against Naxalites in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa, and West Bengal, continued. Human rights advocates argued that the operation sought not only to suppress the Naxalites but also to force these tribal persons off their land, allowing for commercial development. In central India, armed conflict over land and mineral resources in tribal forest areas continued into 2010. Fighting between Naxalite (or Maoist) insurgents and government security forces supported by Salwa Judum militia and Special Police Officers affected more than 200 of India�s 626 districts in 20 of its 29 states in mid-2010. By March 2009, the conflict had displaced 350,000 members of tribal groups, and over 100,000 were believed to have been displaced between mid-2009 and mid-2010. IDP camps that opened in Chhattisgarh for displaced tribal persons caught in fighting between Naxalites and the Salwa Judum in 2006 continued to operate. On 05 July 2011, the Supreme Court pronounced the state-sponsored militia Salwa Judum �illegal and unconstitutional� and directed the government of Chhattisgarh to disband the operation. In addition the court asked Chhattisgarh to immediately cease and desist from using as SPOs tribal persons who had been chosen from Salwa Judum camps against Naxalites in the state, and to recall all firearms issued to SPOs. The Chhattisgarh government was ordered to stop issuing funds in support of SPO recruitment. Following the July 5 judgment, the Chhattisgarh government claimed to have disbanded the Salwa Judum. By September approximately 50,000 tribal persons displaced by the Salwa Judum had returned to their villages. Approximately 15,000 tribal persons remained in 15 Salwa Judum camps. During 2011 India�s armed forces, individual states� security forces, and paramilitary forces continued to engage in armed conflict with insurgent groups in Jammu and Kashmir, several northeastern states, and the Naxalite belt in the central and eastern parts of the country. There was considerably less violence in Jammu and Kashmir than in previous years. Although army and central and state paramilitary forces remained deployed in some states of the northeast and in West Bengal�s Naxalite belt, by year�s end most of the northeast insurgent groups were involved in peace negotiations with the central government. In Naxalite (Maoist) affected districts, there were reports of excessive use of force by security agencies. For example, in the Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh, Koya Commandos, an armed wing of �tribals�--an indigenous group operating with the state government�s approval as SPOs--and CRPF personnel attacked three villages between March 11 and March 16 in search of Maoists. Civil society activists reported that three tribal members were killed and three women were sexually assaulted. The security forces also burned approximately 300 tribal homes. Initially the Chhattisgarh government refused to order a probe into the incident and transferred a top government official in Dantewada who tried to send relief material to the villagers. Human rights activist Swami Agnivesh and journalists who attempted to visit the villages were attacked by SPOs. After severe criticism in the media and a protest by human rights activists, the government responded by transferring a police officer involved in the attack on Agnivesh and ordered a judicial probe. On July 5, unsatisfied by the judicial probe and affidavits filed by the Chhattisgarh government, the Supreme Court ordered the CBI to probe the incident. The CBI did not complete the probe by the end of 2011. Naxalites abducted individuals during 2011. For example, on February 16, a group of 50 Naxals in Orissa kidnapped Indian Administrative Services officer RV Krishna and junior engineer Pabitra Majhi. They were released on February 24, after the Orissa government accepted the Naxalites� demands. There was no evidence that insurgent forces made attempts to prevent or punish human rights violations by their members. There were no reports of deliberate attacks on government hospitals, primary health centers, workers, ambulances, or patients, nor were there restrictions on accessing medical facilities in the Naxal areas of Chattisgarh and Maharashtra. However, there were recorded attacks and explosions at schools, roads and railways tracks. There were no attacks on medical services or Below Poverty Line ration shops. In Chhattisgarh Maoists continued to attack security forces and civilians, killing 13 CRPF personnel in Dantewada District on June 10 and 12. On 19 August 2011, Maoists killed 11 policemen and one civilian in Bijapur District. In Assam there were six incidents during the year of bomb explosions, although no deaths were reported. One explosion, in Kamrup (Rural) District, engineered by the Adivasi People�s Army, injured 100 persons. On 07 January 2011, in Netai Village, part of West Bengal�s Maoist-dominated West Midnapore District, nine persons died when armed Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) workers fired at 2,000 villagers gathering around the house of a CPI-M party leader. This was the bloodiest incident in West Bengal since March 2007, when police killed 14 villagers in Nandigram. The CBI investigated and charged several local and district CPI-M leaders. In response to allegations of Maoist involvement in the incident, the Maoist-backed People�s Committee Against Police Atrocities spokesman argued that the villagers organized themselves to destroy the �harmad� (armed goons) camps, something the administration failed to do. The South Asian Terrorism Portal (SATP), run by the nonprofit Institute for Conflict Management, database reported that during the year 2011 at least 480 persons--including 182 militants, 99 security force personnel, and 199 civilians--were killed as a result of Naxalite (Maoist) violence, a decrease from 2010, when 212 militants, 250 security force personnel, and 528 civilians were killed. According to the SATP database, in 2012 total terrorism or insurgency related fatalities continued to decrease from the previous year. The total deaths reported declined from 1,073 in 2011 to 804 in 2012 (252 civilians, 139 security personnel, and 413 militants). The SATP database reported that 368 persons--including 118 militants, 104 security force personnel, and 146 civilians--were killed during the year as a result of Naxalite (Maoist) violence, a decrease from 2011, when 199 militants, 128 security force personnel, and 275 civilians were killed. The Institute for Conflict Management reported that there were 117 fatalities in Jammu and Kashmir during the year, including 84 alleged terrorists, 17 members of the security forces, and 16 civilians. During the year 2013 the SATP reported 589 fatalities due to terrorism and insurgency (other than Maoist extremism), including 297 civilians, 192 security force members, and 390 terrorists. According to the SATP fatalities due to terrorist violence in the Northeastern States decreased from 316 deaths in 2012 to 271. Fatalities from terrorist violence in Jammu and Kashmir, however, increased from 117 deaths in 2012 to 181 as of December 29. The SATP database reported that 419 persons, including 110 security force personnel, 158 civilians, and 151 Maoist militants, were killed during the year as a result of Naxalite (Maoist) violence, an increase from 2012 when 104 security force personnel, 146 civilians, and 117 Maoist insurgents were killed. The Institute for Conflict Management reported 181 fatalities in Jammu and Kashmir during the year, including 61 security forces persons, 20 civilians, and 100 terrorists. In Naxalite (Maoist) affected districts, there were reports of excessive use of force by security agencies and insurgents. For example, on July 7, Maharashtra police killed six suspected Naxal women in Mendhari village, in Gadchiroli District. After a fact-finding mission, the human rights NGO Coordination of Democratic Rights Organization filed a complaint alleging that police killed the women in captivity after they asked to surrender. Police denied the allegation, and the government of Maharashtra ordered a judicial inquiry. On 25 May 2013, Naxalites killed 29 Congress Party activists in an ambush of the Chhattisgarh Congress� election convoy in Jhiram Ghati (Darbha Valley) in the Bastar region of South Chhattisgarh. Naxalites kidnapped and killed Chhattisgarh state President Nand Kumar Patel, Congress leader Mahendra Karma, and the founder of the disbanded anti-Naxal paramilitary force, Salwa Judum. This was the first Naxal attack on a political group in the Naxal-dominated region of central India. In Maharashtra 45 persons were killed, including seven security personnel, 10 civilians, and 28 insurgents. Insurgents killed three former Salwa Judum members in Chhattisgarh and one in Maharashtra during the year. (In 2011 the Supreme Court disbanded the Salwa Judum militia.) The Indian government vowed in January 2015 to unleash a massive offensive against Maoist rebels in five central and eastern Indian states, which had been most hit by the Maoist insurgency. But there were voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalised and largely indigenous populations in the worst-affected states. In July 2016 the insurgents killed 10 paramilitary soldiers in an ambush in eastern Bihar state. Eight of the officers were killed instantly when the rebels detonated several homemade explosives. A few months later Indian police forces tracked down and killed 24 Maoist rebels in a midnight gunfight in Odisha, the most casualties the group suffered that year. On 02 February 2017, authorities reported that Maoist rebels in eastern India are suspected in the deaths of at least eight police officers killed in a landmine blast. According to senior police officer K.B. Singh, another five officers sustained injuries after their vehicle was attacked in the Koraput region. Police sources said that four bodies were recovered at the scene, while four others died later at a hospital. The 13-man team of young recruits were on their way to Cuttack to be trained as police drivers. Seven Naxalites including two women were killed in an encounter with security forces in Chhattisgarh's Narayanpur district on 12 December 2024. Personnel of the District Reserve Guard (DRG) from Narayanpur, Dantewada, Bastar and Kondagaon districts, Special Task Force (STF) of the state police, and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were involved in the operation. Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai hailed the security forces for the operation and said the fight against Naxalism will continue till it is completely eliminated. With this incident, at least 215 Naxalites have been killed in encounters so far this year in the Bastar division of the state. Naxalite movement appears to have lost its steam in Palamu, once known as the den of Maoists, who used to scare away innocents in the forested hinterlands of this Jharkhand district. Thanks to constant vigil and other strict measures, which are keeping the Naxalites and their sympathisers at bay. apart from a known method like combing operations, another strategy which clicked in taming the Naxalites is going for character certificates of suspected people. Cautious youth who want to land jobs to eke out a living for themselves are choosing to stay away from criminal activities and boycotting Naxals. In a significant statement marking a milestone in the fight against Naxalism, Jharkhand's newly appointed Director General of Police (DGP) Anurag Gupta announced 09 December 2024 that 95% of the Naxal issue in the state has been resolved. However, he acknowledged that the remaining 5% is concentrated in the Chaibasa district, where intensified operations are underway to eradicate the menace completely. Union Home Minister Amit Shah on 10 December 2024 said the BJP-led government at the Centre succeeded in bringing down violence in Jammu and Kashmir, North-East and Naxal-hit areas by 70 per cent in the last 10 years. Amit Shah visited Chhattisgarh from 13 to 15 December 2024. In an August 2024 meeting on anti-Naxal operations, Shah warned the Maoists, saying that they must either \"surrender or be ready to face dire consequences\". So far in 2024, at lesat 207 Maoists had been killed in Chhattisgarh, a significant rise from the 22 killed in 2023. Chhattisgarh police will be deploying at least four new battalions of the paramilitary forces, around 2,800 personnel, in a couple of months in the war-zone Bastar region, officials familiar with the development said 14 August 2024. Officials said that to counter Maoist violence in the region, these forces will be deployed mainly in the intersections of Sukma and Bijapur districts. �Four battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force have been sanctioned by the Union government, and we are planning to deploy them in Sukma and Bijapur districts. The aim is to counter the violence of Battalion number 1 of Maoists, which is responsible for all major attacks in the last 15 years,� said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity. One battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) consists of at least 700 personnel, which means around 2,800 personnel will be in this area in the next few months, officials said. �We believe that Naxalism is the biggest challenge for the democratic system in our nation. In the last four decades, 17,000 people lost their lives because of Naxalism. Since PM Modi-led BJP came to power at the Centre, we have accepted this as a challenge and tried to bring those who have weapons in the hands (Naxalites) into the mainstream,� Union Home Minister Amit Shah said at a briefing 24 August 2024. �100% saturation of Central govt and Chhattisgarh govt's schemes in the naxal affected areas, the progress of infrastructure projects in such areas and to remove the challenges faced during such projects, this meeting was for that,\" he added. �We have neutralised Naxal leaders, and have worked with two objectives - first was to establish Rule of Law in Naxal-affected areas and the second was to develop such areas,� the minister said. Shah said a �strong, ruthless strategy is required for launching last assault against Naxals�. Declaring that the last fight with Maoists is near, Shah declared 24 August 2024 that the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government \"will free India from Naxal violence by March 2026�. | | | --- | | **NEWS****LETTER** | | **Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list** | | **Enter Your Email Address** | Do Not Sell My Personal Information [Advertise with Us](https://www.globalsecurity.org/org/advertise.htm) \\| [About Us](https://www.globalsecurity.org/org/index.html) \\| [Site Map](https://www.globalsecurity.org/sitemap.htm) \\| [Privacy](https://www.globalsecurity.org/privacy.htm)",

    "full_text": "Since its independence in 1947, India has fought dozens of campaigns against four distinct and independent insurgencies on its soil—in Punjab, Kashmir, the Northeast, and the Maoist insurgents of central India—as well as one foreign campaign in Sri Lanka. While India has accumulated a wealth of counterinsurgency (COIN) experience that has varied in terms of terrain, insurgent goals, force structure(s), foreign involvement, and outcomes, most COIN scholars have focused on Western foreign incumbent experiences to the neglect of India and other indigenous incumbents.[1] Nevertheless, as both Iraq and Afghanistan move toward assuming greater responsibility for their internal security amidst continued insurgent activity, India’s COIN strategies can offer important lessons for these states and others that resemble its highly federalized political system, developing economy, and still evolving democracy. One analyst has argued that India has “one of the world’s most successful records in fighting insurgencies,” noting that “it has not yet lost a counterinsurgency campaign within the country.”[2] This claim, however, is puzzling given the current struggles of the Indian government to curb a raging Maoist insurgency. Today, while the insurgencies of the Northeast and Kashmir are largely contained, if not under control, and the Punjab insurgency soundly defeated, India has been earnestly testing different COIN strategies to combat a growing Maoist threat throughout its center and east known generally as the Naxalite insurgency. Since resurging in the last decade, the Naxalite uprising has been described by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as “a great national security threat” and the “biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”[3] This article will briefly describe some of the lessons of success and failure that can be drawn from India’s decades of COIN experience and their application in the current fight against the Naxalite insurgency. India’s Alternative Approach to COIN Generally speaking, the Indian take on COIN appears to depart from the approach advocated by Western doctrine that promotes a population-centric strategy to win “hearts and minds.”[4] Despite Indian official doctrine formally espousing this concept[5] and some contentions that India has always seen COIN as a “political rather than military problem,”[6] a closer look reveals that the Indian approach may be better characterized as a strategy of attrition[7] with the deployment of “raw state coercion”[8] and “enemy-centric” campaigns[9] to suffocate an insurgency through a “saturation of forces.”[10] At times it may involve the co-optation of elites to “buy-out” and contain an insurgency.[11] When the military has been deployed, it operates under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which includes “the power of the security forces to make preventative arrests, search premises without warrant, and shoot and kill civilians.”[12] In each major counterinsurgency campaign, the Indian state developed a number of innovative tactics and organizational capacities that yielded some success along with some negative fallout. During the Punjab campaign, India militarized the police and reversed their role with the military to harness local knowledge and legitimacy and lead kinetic operations.[13] As a result, the police structure remained highly militarized, bloated, inefficient, and incapable of investigative police work more than a decade later.[14] In Kashmir, the creation of a dedicated COIN force—the Rashtriya Rifles, integrating an army ethos into a paramilitary force especially equipped and trained to conduct counterinsurgency—achieved some success, but it ultimately had to be fully manned by army personnel and faced a number of operational and coordination problems with other forces.[15] The co-optation and transformation of insurgents into local assets was a tactic employed both in Punjab (called “CATs,” for Covert Apprehension Technique) and Kashmir (ikhwanis).[16] Turning insurgents was sometimes achieved through money[17] as well as abduction and torture,[18] but these tactics eventually led to new problems, such as increased criminal activity and corrupted security forces, for the respective governments.[19] Moreover, the highly kinetic approach of both campaigns entailed tremendous brutality, torture, disappearances, “encounter killings,” and mass graves that created a litany of human rights investigations and public disaffection, and today continues to fuel simmering resentment and potentially violence.[20] A slight variant of this approach—the buyout and political incorporation of insurgents—has enabled India to keep a lid on a whole host of insurgent separatist movements in the seven states of India’s eastern extremity, India’s Northeast, since 1956.[21] Yet while eliminating the prospect of separatism, it has perversely created spirals of insecurity, splinter groups (there are more than 100 distinct armed groups in the Northeast), and a dysfunctional insurgent political economy of violence, development aid, and interminable militia politics.[22] Overall, the Indian strategy of coercion, co-optation, and containment has achieved moderate success in mitigating the threat to the state, and this is being applied today against the re-emergent Naxalite insurgency. The Naxalite Insurgency The Naxalites first emerged in 1967 in the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal and spread throughout the central states of Bihar, Orissa, and Andhra Pradesh until it was violently suppressed by state and paramilitary forces by 1972. This militant left-wing movement fractured into more than 40 distinct groups, which began to remobilize, consolidate and become more active in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly in the state of Andhra Pradesh.[23] Since 2004, with the merger of the two largest factions—the Peoples War Group and the Maoist Communist Center—to form the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-M), violence has climbed dramatically, with 2,200 incidents and 1,200 killed in 2010 alone.[24] It is estimated that Naxals have a presence in one-third of districts in India,[25] but with the strongest foothold in parts of seven states—West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The difference today is that this region also happens to sit atop tremendous iron ore, coal, and aluminum deposits as well as irrigation and hydroelectric potential.[26] While some parts of the left-wing movement in India are willing to partly or fully embrace parliamentary politics to address issues of class, inequality, and distribution, the hardcore Naxalites remain unwilling to countenance democratic politics and seek the violent overthrow of the state through a variety of tactics.[27] Although conventional accounts describe them as motivated by the broad economic deprivation and absence of the state in much of rural central India,[28] a more specific reason is resentment at the local exploitative power configurations—whether feudal landlords, land-expropriating state governments, or extractive corporations—that continue to dominate and suppress the lower castes and aboriginal tribes that reside in these areas and constitute the Naxalite support base.[29] The Naxalites, however, are a protean movement that has expertly exploited a variety of caste, ethnic, or sectarian cleavages in India.[30] Unlike some of the ethno-sectarian insurgencies of recent years, the Naxalite insurgency—posturing itself as a “people’s war”—comports more with classic COIN theory that was built on notions of competitive state building to address economic and governance deficiencies.[31] In step with their historical experience, however, the Indian state has generally favored a more kinetic approach to counterinsurgency over winning “hearts and minds.”[32] There appears to be an explicit awareness that the Western COIN model may not be the right fit for India. One Indian military analyst and practitioner praised the Andhra Pradesh approach for its “enemy-centric” character, an anathema in current Western COIN discourse.[33] Another well-regarded Indian analyst defended a kinetic focus and derided the hearts and minds “myth” by recalling that even Sir Gerald Templar regarded it as “that nauseating phrase I think I invented.”[34] Moreover, a well-known defense journalist wrote that a population-centric approach “has proved to be flawed.”[35] Indian State Response to the Naxalites State Strategies Given India’s federalist structure, the onus for responding to the rising Naxalite threat has fallen upon individual states, although with substantial federal support during the past five years.[36] The hardest hit states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh—where roughly half of Naxalite activity is concentrated and continues to escalate—have raced to scale up the manpower of their state and local police forces, while being supplemented with about 40 battalions of central paramilitary forces.[37] Meanwhile, states such as Bihar and West Bengal have also seen a rise in violence in recent years as their police manpower has declined or held steady. The composition of police is another variable that may adversely affect outcomes. The police forces of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Orissa are composed of a much higher percentage of paramilitary forces (as opposed to civil police) relative to the Indian average, potentially rendering them less locally knowledgeable or legitimate.[38] Central and state governments have been criticized for their paramilitary forces’ shortfalls in size, antiquated organizational structure and age profile, inadequate training (for instance, only firing 20 rounds per year), and most importantly the absence of coordination or a coherent strategy.[39] The Limits of Indian Responses True to its past history, the Indian central and state governments’ COIN responses have been heavily kinetic, disregarding local public perceptions. One Indian commentator wrote, “exceeding Maoist rebels they accuse of brutality, the police, paramilitary and Salwa Judum recruits continue to freely kill unarmed men and women. It has wrecked any short- to medium-term hope of winning tribals and forest dwellers back to the fold of the state.”[40] With the launch of additional major sweep operations and expansion of commando units, collateral damage of civilians caught in the crossfire and through retribution is expected to rise.[41] Violence, whether premeditated or spontaneous, “can be completely indiscriminate, leading to the burning of the homes of innocents and their torture, maiming, rape, and death.”[42] While there have been centralized efforts to coordinate the use of force and economic development, these have largely faltered due to poor coordination, misutilization, and co-optation by local elites and corporations.[43] The Indian government has repeatedly set up unified commands to better coordinate the use of central paramilitary forces, state armed (paramilitary) police, and state local or civil police, but these have been riddled with problems and at times hindered local innovation.[44] A major attempt was launched with Operation Green Hunt in late 2009, a massive search-and-destroy operation meant to clear out the Naxalite strongholds in the forests of central India. The fissures of this unified command, however, were exposed when a company of central paramilitary forces short on local police support and intelligence were ambushed and more than 80 killed after being tracked for three days by Naxalite insurgents.[45] The two states that appear to be relatively successful at reducing insurgent activity or keeping it at bay are Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Maharashtra seems to have had a relatively higher police to population ratio at the beginning of the decade, potentially buffering it from the spillover of Naxalite insurgency from neighboring areas. While Andhra Pradesh’s manpower ratio rose somewhat over the past decade, its success in dramatically reducing Naxalite activity in its territory is generally attributed by Indian analysts to a rather different strategy of raising a special commando force known as the Greyhounds.[46] The Greyhound Force The Greyhound force, an elite anti-Maoist commando unit, was raised beginning in 1987 from within the Andhra Pradesh police to conduct small unit counterguerrilla offensives against Naxalite insurgents.[47] Roundly believed to have been tremendously successful, the Andhra Pradesh police have drawn inspiration from the infamous Selous Scouts of Rhodesia to prosecute the equivalent of a “bush war” against the Naxalites.[48] The 2,000-strong Greyhound force is better paid and equipped than federal or state paramilitary forces with state of the art weapons and technology, better trained in jungle warfare, and moves in nimbler, highly capable units to target, track, and destroy insurgent networks by modeling guerrilla tactics.[49] The Greyhounds are also well supported by the entire state police force.[50] Two companies of Greyhounds would be deployed at a joint operational base with two platoons of local home guards for intelligence and logistical support.[51] Between 2005 and 2008, they have been credited with bringing down the Maoist cadre in Andhra Pradesh from 1,200 to 500 and Naxalite activity in the state this decade has dropped from a peak of roughly 600 attacks in 2003 to around 100 in 2010.[52] Their success was attributed to signals intelligence exploitation, careful operational planning, jungle survival training, night operations, and decapitation of Maoist leadership.[53] The Greyhound model is perceived to be so successful that many states are starting to develop their own small unit commando police battalions. While the Indian central government continues to pour central paramilitary forces into the region (now on the order of about 70 battalions), it is also raising 10 Commando Battalions for Resolute Action (CoBRA) and deploying them alongside state and federal units.[54] Yet one should be leery of the triumphant claims made of Andhra Pradesh as well as the potential to model the Greyhound success. First, there is reason to believe that the Greyhounds did not defeat the Maoist insurgents outright but merely displaced them to neighboring states. This corresponds with data that shows Naxalite activity skyrocketed in neighboring Chhattisgarh as it declined in Andhra Pradesh.[55] Second, intelligence officers and other analysts believe gains in Andhra Pradesh are unsustainable and the state remains highly vulnerable to Maoist activity.[56] This fear was validated by a recent Times of India-IMMRB survey of five northern districts of Andhra Pradesh recently cleared of Maoist insurgents where the majority of those surveyed still sympathized with Naxalite motives, methods, and results, and viewed actions by state forces such as encounter killings as suspect and unjustified. Meanwhile, a plurality believed nothing had improved and exploitation had increased since their departure.[57] Even if the Naxalite presence and violence has been structurally reduced, the survey revealed that the strategy has certainly not relied upon winning hearts and minds to achieve this end. Finally, even if the Greyhound approach was actually successful, the background conditions required to achieve operational effectiveness are currently absent or underdeveloped in the rest of the country. Andhra Pradesh began raising the Greyhounds in 1987 but did not achieve marked success until almost two decades later. Despite the state having a relatively efficient policing system, both the Greyhound commandos and the state police and security force serving as the logistical and intelligence “tail” took substantial time to mature.[58] New police inductees served first in the Greyhound support unit for about four years before rotating to the district level where they might continue to support operations.[59] This gradually built up inter-organizational familiarity and cooperation within the state, and the substantial network of well-trained local police—features noticeably absent in the rest of Naxal-affected India—were able to funnel high quality intelligence for Greyhound targeting.[60] Conclusion Three points are worth noting about Indian counterinsurgency strategy. First, rather than abiding by a singular formula, strategies have varied over time and space depending on the context and nature of the insurgency. Second, India has routinely departed from the traditional “hearts and minds” or population-centric COIN for a highly kinetic and coercive enemy-centric COIN. Third, Indian successes are never “clean” and always involve uncomfortable tradeoffs, whether by way of criminal activity, organizational dysfunction and corruption, or further insurgency. These should all be expected as India faces down the Naxalite insurgency over what might be a full decade or more.[61] This third point is in part related to India’s democratic character. The mobilization capacity of insurgents creates perverse interests by political parties to harness these assets for their own ends.[62] In fact, for much of the earlier part of this decade, most Naxal-affected states “abdicated their authority over vast regions, as long as the semblance of normalcy could be maintained and the electoral interests of the dominant political party could be taken care of.”[63] Moreover, Indian counterinsurgency has been and will likely continue to look both brutal and incomplete (by Western standards) because the incumbent is unwilling to countenance the types of institutional overhauls needed to fully quell insurgent impulses. If the fundamental conflict is not over the distribution of resources that can be mended with economic development, but rather the distribution of power controlled by the state and elite cadres, then the disease is the system.[64] The cure then may deeply threaten not only India’s growth engine that has relied upon land appropriation and displacement for industrialization and mining, but also the power, composition, and identity of the Indian state stretching from the local level up to the state and national governments.

Achuthan, “Tackling Maoists: The Andhra Paradigm,” Indian Defence Review 25:2 (2010). [27] Naxalite insurgents have targeted “class enemies” (sometimes through beheadings), police and security forces, infrastructure such as police stations, schools, local government buildings, roads, power lines, railways, and economic targets like mining and energy infrastructure. They have been able to carry out these activities through the acquisition as well as indigenous production of a wide variety of weapons including automatic firearms, rocket launchers, and a whole host of mines for which they use to conduct IED attacks and small unit ambushes. See Ramana; Achuthan; Sudeep Chakravarti, “No End in Sight,” Seminar 605 (2010). The Naxalites are also reported to provide public goods to local residents such as security, swift justice in “people’s courts,” education, irrigation, community kitchens, medical units, and minimum wage enforcement in part through extortion and taxation of local government offices, contractors, businessmen, and industrialists. See Bedi; Oetken; Chakravarti; Pratul Ahuja and Rajat Ganguly, “The Fire Within: Naxalite Insurgency Violence in India,” Small Wars and Insurgencies 18:2 (2007). [28] For example, the Ministry of Home Affairs Annual Report from 2006-07 states, “Naxalites typically operate in a vacuum created by inadequacy of administrative and political institutions, espouse local demands and take advantage of the prevalent disaffection, perceived injustice among the underprivileged and remote segments of population.” Also see “India’s Naxalites: A Spectre Haunting India,” Economist, August 17, 2006; Vani K.

It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. Picture source: Depositphotos. _Prospects & Perspectives No. 28_ **The Shadow War: How the Pahalgam Terror Attack Redefined India-China-Pakistan Equation** By _Jagannath Panda_ The Pahalgam [terror attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl) of April 2025, executed by the Pakistan-backed group [The Resistance Front](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473) (TRF), was not merely another episode in the long-running saga of India-Pakistan hostility. It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. By and large, India’s reaction was strong, swift, and assertive beyond the border against the terrorist outfits harbored in Pakistan. The launch of [Operation Sindoor](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473), a precise military response targeting terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC), marked a defining evolution in India’s deterrence doctrine, pointing to a zero-tolerance strategy against terrorism. More than a tactical strike, it was a message — India will respond with resolve, not restraint, when its civilians are attacked. The operation drew clear parallels with the Balakot airstrikes of 2019, yet the context had shifted. The regional climate in 2025 is far more combustible, with trilateral tensions simmering in the Himalayas. The Pahalgam incident has exposed deep-seated fractures in the regional power matrix. China’s strategic posture in the aftermath — marked by conspicuous silence, selective language, and diplomatic hedging — underscores a growing contradiction between its self-styled image as a responsible global power and its operational behavior in South Asia. By refusing to acknowledge the terrorist dimension of such attacks or to pressure its close partner, Pakistan, Beijing reveals a troubling unwillingness to act as a genuine stabilizing force in the region. The contradictions in its stand are only growing and becoming more transparent to the world by the day. Is China truly committed to regional peace and stability, or is it bound by time-worn strategic alignments that prioritize geopolitical advantage over normative responsibility? Can a power that positions itself as an architect of global order afford to undermine its credibility by shielding a state associated with cross-border terrorism? What should be India’s strategic response to this shadow war? **Beijing’s Balancing Act: Neutrality or Strategic Collusion?** Following India’s retaliation, the world watched closely for diplomatic fallout. China’s response was a masterclass in studied ambiguity. Beijing termed India’s military action “ [regrettable](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202505/t20250507_11616523.html)” while conspicuously omitting any condemnation of the terror attack itself. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made [no mention](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/lxjzh/202505/t20250509_11618305.html) of the victims in Pahalgam, nor TRF’s Pakistani connections. Instead, Beijing’s focus remained firmly on urging “restraint” and “dialogue,” echoing a playbook that has often shielded Islamabad from international censure. This is not entirely a new behavior on the part of the Chinese leadership. Beijing has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the UN Security Council to [block designations of known terrorists](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slams-china-at-un-for-blocking-move-to-designate-2611-accused-sajid-mir-as-global-terrorist/article66993043.ece) based in Pakistan, including Sajid Mir, a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander involved in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008. This pattern of diplomatic protection underscores China’s strategic calculus: Pakistan is more than an ally — it is a linchpin in Beijing’s South Asia strategy and a buffer against Indian regional ascendency. What makes China’s stance especially problematic is its persistent refusal to differentiate between India’s counterterrorism actions and aggressive behavior. Chinese state media and official discourse frequently conflate Indian responses along the LoC with assertive conduct along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), crafting a narrative in which India is portrayed as a regional aggressor. This distortion allows Beijing to simultaneously align with Pakistan’s security outlook while maintaining a superficial neutrality. Moreover, China’s behavior mirrors its broader geopolitical approach: internal threats such as “Uyghur separatism” are met with uncompromising state violence, while external threats that affect neighbors like India are compartmentalized or ignored. The selective outrage is a window into Beijing’s dual standards on terrorism and state sovereignty. **Proxy Wars and Silent Partners: Redrawing the Diplomatic Map** Beyond the rhetoric, Beijing’s alignment with Pakistan is rooted in hard interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the crown jewel of Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This infrastructure project is not just about roads and pipelines — it’s about strategic depth. Any Indian challenge to the territorial status quo threatens both Pakistan’s and China’s investments, thereby sealing the logic of Beijing’s indirect complicity. This complicity extends into the diplomatic arena. In multilateral forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China has consistently [blocked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/human-rights-must-be-respected-india-after-skipping-xinjiang-vote/articleshow/94713915.cms) Indian attempts to highlight Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism. Instead, China promotes counterterrorism frameworks that align neatly with its own domestic narratives, especially those concerning Xinjiang, while conveniently avoiding issues that implicate Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues its [strategic silence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/22/asia/imran-khan-xinjiang-axios-intl-hnk) on China’s repression of Uyghur Muslims, despite its self-styled image as a champion of the Islamic world. This tacit exchange of blind spots — on terrorism and human rights — has become the bedrock of the Sino-Pakistani axis. And India, despite walking a tightrope on sensitive Chinese issues like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, has received no reciprocation in the form of diplomatic neutrality or support. The geopolitical geometry is clear: while India and Pakistan battle over borders and ideology, China plays the dual role of facilitator and firewall for Islamabad. Whether in backchannel diplomacy or in global institutions, China consistently acts to dilute pressure on Pakistan, reinforcing a strategic triangle that disadvantages New Delhi at every turn. Beijing’s deliberate omission of Pakistani provocations and cross-border violence in its Operation Sindoor response press briefings suggests a calculated strategic posture. This silence reflects China’s continued alignment with Pakistan, indicating that broader geopolitical considerations outweigh any immediate concerns about regional instability. By not publicly addressing Islamabad’s role, China signals its intent to preserve and prioritize its long-standing strategic partnership with Pakistan. **A Call for India’s Strategic Realignment** In this increasingly tangled web of interests, India must reassess its China doctrine. The idea of Beijing as a potential stabilizer in South Asia has little basis in reality. Instead, China has shown a consistent willingness to prioritize its strategic partnerships and investments over regional peace or normative alignment against terrorism. One avenue for India is to adopt a strategy of normative reciprocity. If China insists on referring to Jammu and Kashmir as a “disputed territory,” India could begin more openly addressing Chinese sensitive issues, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and potentially even Taiwan, revisiting its “One China” policy. Until now, India has largely upheld a principle of “mutual sensitivity” regarding core sovereignty concerns. While China has been increasingly assertive in internationalizing the Kashmir issue — whether through UN Security Council interventions, statements aligning with Pakistan, or selective cartographic provocations — India has avoided reciprocal commentary on China’s sensitive regions. This asymmetric restraint has allowed China to shape narratives unchallenged, while denying India the same deference on issues central to its national unity. Engaging Taiwan more openly — especially on trade, technology, and democratic solidarity — aligns India with other democracies like the U.S., Japan, and parts of Europe that have gradually normalized unofficial ties. Strengthening ties with Taiwan also offers India access to high-end manufacturing, especially in semiconductors, where Taiwan’s TSMC dominates global supply chains, critical for India’s tech and defense sectors. A closer India-Taiwan dynamic could be used as part of a broader Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance Chinese assertiveness in the region, especially when coupled with defense dialogues like the Quad. Explicit moves on Taiwan would likely provoke strong diplomatic and possibly economic retaliation from Beijing. This could take the form of border pressure along the LAC, trade restrictions, or cyber disruptions. Any move on Taiwan would have more impact if coordinated with partners like the U.S., Japan, or Australia. A unilateral shift may yield limited strategic gain while exposing India to disproportionate costs. It is therefore imperative that India must continue to invest more robustly in multilateral and minilateral coalitions that exclude or counterbalance China, such as the Quad, the India-Japan-Australia trilateral, and enhanced EU engagements. India’s aspiration to be recognized as a major international power, including in the “Global South,” depends not solely on its material capabilities but also on its normative influence, particularly in shaping global discourses on terrorism. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, New Delhi may need to recalibrate its approach by intensifying collaboration with global norm entrepreneurs, including middle powers across Europe and Asia, as well as transnational civil society and multilateral institutions. Moreover, India’s leadership roles in forums such as the G20 and BRICS present strategic platforms through which it can reframe regional security narratives and assert its vision for counterterrorism norms. Domestically, India must prepare for the long haul. The possibility of a coordinated two-front scenario — with Pakistan engaging in asymmetric warfare through proxy actors and irregular tactics and China providing strategic and diplomatic cover — is no longer hypothetical. Preparing for this evolving threat environment requires India to adopt a comprehensive and long-term security posture, encompassing military modernization, institutional resilience, and societal preparedness. Enhancing border infrastructure, upgrading intelligence and surveillance capabilities, and fortifying strategic deterrence must be non-negotiables in India’s defense roadmap. Sustaining a prolonged state of readiness requires a resilient defense-industrial base, robust supply chains, and financial planning. India must continue reforms to reduce dependence on foreign arms imports, incentivize indigenous R&D, and create strategic reserves for critical materials. Further, building robust logistical networks, especially in border states and high-altitude regions, will improve troop mobility and sustain long-term deployments. Civil-military synergy in infrastructure projects such as roads, airfields, and telecommunications along both western and eastern frontiers is essential. The shifting threat landscape demands that India move beyond reactive postures. Both Pakistan and China are adept at leveraging information warfare and disinformation to influence public opinion and sow discord. India must invest in counter-disinformation capacities, strategic communication, and public awareness campaigns to build regional and societal resilience against foreign psychological operations, where Taiwan could emerge as a stronger partner. New Delhi must significantly enhance its capabilities in narrative warfare — a strategic effort to shape perceptions, control the discourse, and influence international opinion. This involves not only countering adversarial narratives but also proactively framing its own story in a manner that resonates with global audiences. India’s case against Pakistan-based terrorism, as well as China’s tacit support through diplomatic silence or selective framing, must be articulated with clarity, credibility, and moral authority. To be effective, this narrative must be disseminated across multiple global platforms — from the United Nations and international media to think tanks, academic forums, and digital diplomacy channels — to expose the regional destabilizing roles of both Pakistan and China, and to align international sentiment with India’s security concerns and normative positions. The decision to send [delegations](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seven-all-party-delegations-to-take-indias-message-against-terrorism-to-key-partner-nations-government/article69586448.ece) to 32 nations is a strong first step. Publishing credible evidence, such as satellite imagery, financial trail disclosures, or intercepted communications, can further strengthen the factual basis of India’s narrative and pre-empt counterclaims. **Conclusion: Pahalgam as a Turning Point** The Pahalgam terrorist attack will be remembered not just for its human toll, but for what it revealed about the shifting tectonics of regional power complexities. It was a moment of clarity: India is not just facing a belligerent neighbor in Pakistan, but also contending with a cunning and double-standard power in China that is willing to obscure terrorism behind the veil of strategic self-interest. Increasingly, China’s actions — or calculated inactions — are rendering its strategic contradictions more visible to the international community, challenging the coherence of its South Asia policy and weakening its claim to impartiality in regional conflict resolution. The path ahead for India requires more than conventional military readiness; it calls for a fundamental reassessment of the strategic assumptions underpinning India's approach to China, particularly regarding Beijing’s role in shaping, enabling, or deferring regional crises. New Delhi’s challenge is two-fold. It must deter asymmetric threats from across the border, and it must decode and counteract the quieter, more insidious enablers of that threat. That means not just stronger borders, but sharper diplomacy. Not just better arms, but better arguments. Narrative warfare, if conducted strategically, allows India not just to defend its position but to shape the global agenda on terrorism and regional order, reinforcing its claim to normative leadership as a rising power. Pahalgam may have been a tragedy for India, but it is also an inflection point. A new foreign policy realism must follow. Because in this geopolitical theatre, the shadows are as dangerous as the swords.

Its four primary partners, U.S. Pacific Command, Tripler Army Medical Center, the University of Hawaii and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention act collectively to support a body of operational research. Disaster Response in India represents the first product of these efforts. The Center of Excellence, a unique and forward-thinking partnership, acts as a facilitator among the many organizations which are critical players in the delivery of disaster management, relief and recovery. Its research mission cuts across organizational boundaries and thus the Center is able to identify proposals of universal benefit. Focusing through a collaborative lens allows the Center to work with more appropriate, multi-pronged approaches leveraged across civilian, military and private partnerships. The commitment to support operational research in a variety of fields and disciplines - from public and mental health issues in refugee populations to re-establishing functioning infrastructure in devastated communities - evolved from the core purposes of the Center, which is to bring together the best individuals and organizations who are dedicated to improving the world’s ability to respond to natural and complex humanitarian events. The authors’ work herein, the culmination of many hours of intensive labor, contributes to an appreciation of foreign disaster management processes, encourages international cooperation, and supports disaster management institutions and professionals in all countries and regions. To conduct and publish findings as these is of benefit to all peoples. In our shrinking, interdependent world, the drop of even a small stone in one place leads to ripples felt in the most remote corners of the world. It is our hope that this document will see widespread distribution, and through extensive use that it be passed along to colleagues as a tome on the topic. Fredrick M.

The number has been increasing every year because of the mixture of various factors such as adverse weather, population growth, urbanization, and industrialization. How the Republic of India organizes for managing significant natural and man-made disasters, its capacity for effective response, and its ability to achieve unity of effort among governmental and non-governmental organizations are the elements of analysis here. This is of interest because India is an emerging world power; it is currently the second largest country in the world in population, and by 2050 it will have surpassed China as the largest. The number of Indians affected by disaster events shows a steady upward trend. Disasters have been taking a heavy toll of human and animal lives. Floods have proven to be the most devastating type of natural disaster in India, causing the maximum number of deaths and damage to property (cyclones have taken a heavy toll of lives and caused widespread devastation). At the same time, droughts affect a large segment of population, resulting in loss of employment and migration to other regions. Earthquakes have caused a comparatively lower amount of damage, but landslides are likely to increase in frequency in the coming years because of deforestation and over development on hillsides. Conurbation and industrialization have combined to create a dangerous synergy that now presents a significant hazard to India’s people. In responding to these kinds of hazards, India’s disaster management officials and professional humanitarians conduct disaster planning and response generally within a paradigm of three phases: Pre-disaster; Emergency (or Disaster Impact); Post Disaster(or Recovery). There is a strong emphasis in government policy and planning to encourage mitigation, i.e., actions taken prior to the occurrence of a disaster, including preparedness and long-term risk reduction measures. 1 Elephants on the Rajpath Defending Rashtrapati Bhavan (President’s Palace) To encourage effective training, coordination and planning for disaster response, the Government of India established in 1995 a National Center for Disaster Management; and in 1998, India’s Minister for Agriculture announced the formation of a National Commission on Disaster Management. These will facilitate the evolution of a National Disaster Management Plan. The Plan is now under development and is expected to be completed in 2001. RESPONSE SYSTEM Under India’s federal system, the states have responsibility for disaster response. When the disasters is severe or spread over several states, the Central Government supplements the efforts of state governments by providing financial and material assistance. Government policy response to a natural calamity is provided by the Prime Minister, Cabinet Committees and the Agriculture Minister. The objectives of policy response are to address the sufferings of the people affected by the natural calamity. A policy response often leads to visits to the calamity affected areas by President, Prime Minister and other dignitaries; setting up machinery for implementing, reviewing and monitoring the relief measures; and activating the administrative response process for assistance in relief measures. The state governments in India are autonomous in organizing relief operations in the event of natural disaster and also for purposes of long term preparedness and rehabilitation measures. The states deal with natural disasters through their Revenue Departments or Relief Organizations. 2 REVENUE Division Commissioner DISTRICT MAGISTRATE Divisional Sub-Divisional MAGISTRATE TEHSILDARS PATEL OR PATWARI (POLICY AND PLANNING) (CONTROL ROOM) (DISTRICT) (SUB-DIVISION) (TEHSIL) (VILLAGE) OTHER DEPARTMENTS POLICE HOME GUARD CIVIL DEFENSE STATE CRISIS MANAGEMENT GROUP EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER RELIEF COMMISSIONER STATE GOVERNMENT CHIEF SECRETARY TYPICAL ORGANIZATION FOR STATE EMERGENCY The states also have a State Crisis Management Group (SCMG) which functions under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary and/or Relief Commissioner. The Group comprises senior officers from the departments of revenue and relief, home, civil supplies, power, irrigation, water supply, local self government (panchayat), agriculture, forests, rural development, health, planning, public works and finance. States develop the contingency plans for disaster response and long-term strategies for mitigation. The state response plan identifies the functional areas such as relief, communications, information, transport, health services, etc. and proposes assignments to the various departments. The plan also lays down preparedness checklists, operating procedures and reporting formats. The state mitigation strategy argues for better land use management, building codes, traffic standards, health standards, and so on. These objectives are to be secured through disaster legislation, mitigation regulation, and incentives for mitigation. The State Relief Commissioner establishes an Emergency Operations Center (Control Room) as soon as disaster situation develops. The Center collects and disseminates the latest information on forecasting and warning of disaster, and functions as the focal point for coordinating disaster relief efforts with the other concerned departments. THE FIRST RESPONDERS Every state is divided into a number of districts. The head of the district administration is known as the District Magistrate or Deputy Commissioner. (In some states, he is better known as the Collector). The District Magistrate is in charge of all the relief measures at the district level. The State government routes its instructions through him, and the District Magistrate ensures that the total efforts of the district are geared in a coordinated manner to providing disaster relief to the people. Sometimes, in emergency situations, the District Magistrate’s powers are enhanced with a view to ensuring complete unison in the efforts of all the concerned departments. A district is further sub-divided into sub-divisions and tehsils. The head of the sub-division is called a Sub-Divisional Officer or Deputy Collector while the tehsil is headed by an officer called the Tehsildar. The lowest unit of administration is the village whose revenue matters are attended to by a functionary known as Patel or Patwari. These lower tiers of administration provide the first responders that do the work, and 3 they are a critically important source of leadership during disaster events. When disaster strikes, the District Magistrate activates his contingency plan with the help of Control Room staff who monitor rescue and relief efforts. Also assisting is the District Relief Committee which includes local representatives of the people, members of the legislative assembly and the parliament. Through these mechanisms, the District Magistrate coordinates with central government authorities and defense forces, and he synchronizes the voluntary efforts of NGOs with the efforts of the district administration. THE NGOS India has a strong tradition of voluntary organizations responding to any calamity or disaster overwhelming the people. The voluntary organizations offer immediately available communications within the disaster affected community, technical services, manpower, and financial support. Services provided by the NGOs include awareness and information campaigns, training for local volunteers, immediate rescue and first aid, psychological aid, food, water, medicine, other materials, sanitation and hygiene, damage assessment, reconstruction and financial aid. The 1998 cyclone in Gujarat provides some idea of the scope of NGO emergency assistance during a disaster event in India: • CARE-India: food for two months and 350 tents worth Rs. 700,000; • CARITAS: housing reconstruction; • Catholic Relief Service: $10,000 for shelter and drinking water, and 161 tonnes of food supplies; • The Discipleship Center: plastic sheets, utensils, bed sheets, sarees, dhotis, and children’s clothing; • OXFAM: food grains, plastic sheets, clothing; • World Vision:roof tiles, wood materials for home reconstruction. India prefers not to request disaster assistance in any formal way from donor nations or international organizations. Its stated policy is that India will rely on its own resources to resolve disaster situations. But it is difficult to imagine disaster relief operations without the 4 contributions of the international and India-based NGOs. To avoid being at cross purposes with Indian policy, international organizations and donor nations usually provide disaster assistance resources to local level governments and grass-roots organizations via on-site NGOs. DISASTER RESPONSE AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE Disaster events in recent years have placed great demands on India’s disaster management system, and the year 1998 was a particularly bad one for the country. Floods affected several states. A cyclone of severe intensity devastated Gujarat. Landslides took a heavy toll of human lives in the hill regions of Uttar Pradesh. The Orissa cyclone of 1999 was the greatest natural disaster the country has faced in the 20th century. These hazards illustrate the magnitude of the challenge. Floods There were unprecedented rains in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir in September 1988. In Kapurthala district, the water from Beas river submerged about 150 villages under 8 to 12 feet of water. In Jalandhar, fifty per cent of the standing crops were destroyed. In Ropar, thousands of people were trapped in flood waters and had to spend several nights on the rooftops of their houses. Gurdaspur town had two to four feet of water. The Government of India formed a Crisis Management Group under the chairmanship of the Relief Commissioner. The Armed Forces helped to evacuate people, and provided air, land and water transportation. A voluntary body known as Flood Relief Society was formed with Justice Ajit Singh Bains, a retired judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, as Chairman to provide relief to the flood affected people of Punjab. The Society made Sikh and Hindu temples the focal points for collecting relief material. In Himachal Pradesh, Kinnaur, Una, Chamba, Kulu and Shimla were badly affected. More than a dozen bridges in different parts of the State collapsed, and about two thousand persons were marooned in the Pong dam area. Una was completely cut off. People living in Chamba along the Ravi river had to be shifted to safer places. The Border Security Forces personnel were marooned at their outposts. Thein dam was threatened. The Grand Trunk Road between Beas, Rayya and Khalichain was submerged under three to four feet of water. 5 Over 405 thousand cubic feet per second (cusecs) of water was flowing in river Sutlej on September 24 against its capacity of 305 thousand cusecs. There was panic about the safety of the Bhakra Dam. The reservoir attained the highest ever level of 1687.47 ft., which was above the maximum storage level designed for the dam. The Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) released the extra water without bothering about the capacity of the reservoirs below. The BBMB did not warn the district authorities or the people before releasing the water. People in areas downstream were caught unawares–aggravating the magnitude of the disaster. There was loss of life and property on a massive scale. In northern areas of India, catchment areas have deteriorated due to increasing deforestation and urbanization leading to the reservoirs getting silted, their storage capacity reduced, and life span cut short. The 1998 floods also affected large areas of northern and eastern states with Upper Assam being the worst affected. Nearly 5,000 villages were submerged, and a total of 3.6 million people were affected by the fury of the Brahmaputra river. Majuli, the largest river island in the world, was completely submerged and over 100,000 people living on the island had to be evacuated. In West Bengal, more than half the total population of Malda were rendered homeless–1.5 million people. Large areas of Murshidabad were inundated by the Bhagirathi river. Army and the Border Security Force personnel assisted the State administration in the rescue and relief operations. The Navy also sent boats and a team of 50 people including doctors to Malda. In Bihar, a total of nearly 12 million people in over 7,200 villages in 28 districts in north and central Bihar were affected. Army personnel assisted in relief works in Katihar and Darbhanga districts. There were floods in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya also. The severity of flooding in these states was comparatively less in the strategic sense, but no less serious to the victims. Cyclones in Gujarat and Orissa Gujarat state was lashed by a severe cyclonic storm on June 9, 1998. About 1,250 people were killed while over one thousand were reported missing. There was devastation on a large scale in the districts of Kutch, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Porbandar, Junagadh, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Banaskantha, Surat, Bharuch, Valsad and Navsari. Nearly 66 hectares of agricultural land was eroded and thousands of trees were uprooted. 6 The gateway along the Gulf of Kutch became a graveyard of vessels with 40 ships having run aground and five of them actually sinking. The Gujarat government reacted with a “caterpillar-like pace,” according to India Today magazine. In the State Assembly, the Congress members, during discussions on the tragedy, harped on the point that a majority of lives lost on June 9, 1998 along the Saurashtra-Kutch coastline could have been saved had the State Government implemented a sound disaster management plan. The Union Home Minister conceded that the cyclone forecast of the Meteorological Department had gone awry as there was no mention in its forecast that Kutch district, which was worst affected, would be hit. There was also lack of communication between the Kandla Port Trust Authorities and the district administration. It also came to light that the Kandla Port Trust had been repeatedly warned about the consequences of tampering with coastal ecosystems and building too many new projects in the Kandla Port area. Political considerations had led to project after project being cleared. The Government of Gujarat had even altered the Coastal Management Plan to facilitate projects in the Coastal Regulation Zone. In recent years, construction of chemical facilities, petroleum complexes, cement factories, ports and jetties had stripped the coastal natural barriers formed by coral outcrops, sand banks, mangrove plants and dunes. Nothing remained to impede the 200 km/h cyclonic winds and four-meter tidal waves—a large number of innocents died. In response, the Government of India decided to give assistance to the maritime states in the Ninth Plan for the protection of critical reaches of coastal areas. Under this scheme, the coastal areas would be protected by constructing sea walls. The Coastal Protection and Development Advisory Committee has prepared a comprehensive National Coastal Protection Project estimated to cost Rs. 16 billion. The cyclone which lashed Orissa on October 29, 1999 has been described by Sitakant Mahapatra as “perhaps the greatest tragedy Orissa has faced since the Kalinga war that converted... Ashoka to Buddhism.” The death toll was over 10,000 and the total loss of property has been estimated at Rs. 10 billion. Landslides On August 18, 1998, a massive landslide wiped out the entire Malpa village in the Pithoragarh district of Uttar Pradesh, killing about 210 people. Earlier, 76 people were killed in devastating landslides in the 7 Ukhimath block of Rudraprayag district on August 12. There were landslides in the Ukhimath area again on August 19, killing 26 people. A total of nearly 400 people are estimated to have been killed and 12 villages were wiped out in a series of landslides spread over a period of ten days in the hill regions of Uttar Pradesh. A team of 200 personnel from the Army, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Pradeshik Armed Constabulary and Border Security Force was rushed to Malpa to carry out the relief operations. The State Government announced an ex gratia of Rs. one hundred thousand each to the next of kin of those killed in the tragedy, Rs. 50,000.00 each to the injured, and Rs. 25,000.00 for the reconstruction of damaged houses. The community response was spontaneous. A correspondent who toured the region commented that the Ukhimath community set a stellar example in altruism. Every family fed at least one person affected by the landslides. “We take it that every family has one more member to look after,” as a student of the Garhwal University said. The Yuvak Mangal Dal and the Mahila Mangal Dal, voluntary associations of youth and women in the region, did yeoman’s service in rushing to the unsafe areas with succor. The Himalayan Environment Studies and Conservation Organization, an NGO, sent medicines and relief materials. In spite of recurring landslides in the region, adequate attention has not been paid to planning and preventative measures. The cumulative effects of deforestation, erosion, water-logging, salinity and nutrient depletion all over the country have led to a loss of approximately Rs.232 billion. Technological Disaster–Long-term Effects Remain The Bhopal gas tragedy, which took place on December 3, 1984, was the worst technological disaster of the country. It was the result of faulty design, poor maintenance and unsatisfactory plant operation. Union Carbide, a U.S.-based multinational company, had a plant manufacturing Sevin and other pesticides at Bhopal. On the night of December 2, methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas escaped into Bhopal’s night air. It is estimated that as as many as 18,000 human deaths resulted from the incident, and large numbers of livestock perished. Today, some 15 years after the event, relatively few people have been properly compensated for their losses, and there are perhaps as many as 125,000 people who are in an acute state of ill health as a result of a whole range of diseases like breathlessness, eye problems, 8 neurological disorders, menstrual and other reproductive abnormalities, anxiety, depression and obstructive pulmonary disease. The Bhopal experience has provided a number of lessons, such as the need to regulate the growth of industries producing hazardous products. The most important of these is suggested by Dr. R. B. Sharma, Director of the Disaster Management Institute in Bhopal: The basic point of disaster management recovery is the human dimension. We are too concerned with the material. There is little attention to what happens after the disaster. The cyclones, earthquakes, floods, and landslides of 1998 and 1999, as well as the lingering effects of the Bhopal tragedy, suggest the grand dimensions of India’s disaster management challenge. It also suggests the capabilities and capacities for disaster management in India today. THE FUTURE FOR INDIA’S DISASTER MANAGEMENT The overall trend is towards more disaster-related deaths and losses. Some reasons for this are: • Continuing population growth which will overload the available infrastructure and services, even without the advent of disasters; • Increasing pressure on a land that will have to feed the world’s most populous nation but, year after year, is vulner\u0002able to the vagaries of weather; • Uneven economic growth that may result in a better life for some sectors while leaving oth\u0002ers destitute and unable to ward off hazards; • Interdependence of countries and regions whereby hazards in one region impact directly on others, such as low-land flooding caused by denudation of upland forests, or a nuclear accident in one region which casts fallout on another. 9 Bhopal: The Union Carbide Plant as it Appears Today. Experience shows that in the event of a disaster, the government response is generally tardy. Critics suggest that this is because the bureaucracy, which was once considered the “steel frame” of administration, has over the years become inefficient and corrupt. Millions are spent on flood protection schemes and drought relief measures, but only a fraction really shows. Analyzing disaster management in India, Times of India commentator Rajiv Desai recently wrote: Lives are lost, families ruined and property is destroyed. The only survivors are those who govern: politicians, bureaucrats and their retinue. ...no one is held accountable for public safety. Thus, the very minimum requirement of governance is waived. Never mind disaster management, the government itself is the disaster. The Government of India has the requisite structure to cope with disasters. There are detailed orders and manuals on related subjects, particularly at the state level. However, the Central Government has yet to publish a national emergency management plan and lacks the formal and official framework for strategic guidance and doctrinal development. Nevertheless, the confluence of effort by professionals associated with organizations such as the National Center for Disaster Management, Disaster Management Institute, Indira Gandhi National Open University, and so on, has developed a body of knowledge relevant to India’s situation. The universal themes which have evolved from this effort suggest the following doctrinal imperatives for future initiatives: • A strong focus on disaster prevention and mitigation; • Long-term measures to fight earthquake–economic and technical effort; • Control of economic development to reduce the impact on the land and resulting changes to the flow of water run-off; • Setaside funding by the states for disaster emergencies, aug\u0002mented by Central Government grants; • The need for networking among disaster management organiza\u0002tions, government agencies, and non-government volunteer or\u0002ganizations; 10 • An emphasis on training and publishing the professional body of knowledge; • Emphasis on the human dimension of disasters, particularly the social, medical, and psychological aspects of long-term recovery. Given India’s constitutional guidelines of state responsibility for disaster management, a ponderous bureaucracy, an historical preference for devolving responsibility to regional levels of government, it seems likely that India’s forthcoming National Disaster Management Plan will provide generalized policy constructs. The locus of disaster prevention and relief will remain with state governments, with the primary burden carried by the District Magistrate. Under siege by the current onslaught of cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and landslides, nuclear weapons bring an added dimension to India’s disaster management challenge. The confrontation between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir problem poses a proximate threat to peace and stability in the sub-continent. The acquisition of nuclear capability by both India and Pakistan has added a new and unwanted component to disaster prevention and assistance. As some Indian disaster specialists suggest, there remains some comfort in what seems to be India’s almost unlimited capacity to absorb shocks. There have been waves of invasion from across the north-west frontier through the centuries, but the spirit of India was never vanquished. India always reasserted itself, and with this spirit of certitude India will approach the coming challenges of disaster response in the new millennium. 11",

Aligned with China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) and bolstered by pseudo-private contractors such as i-SOON (Anxun Information Technology Co., Ltd.), Salt Typhoon employs custom firmware implants, living-off-the-land binaries, and stealthy router rootkits to maintain persistent, covert access within major telecom environments across the United States, United Kingdom, Taiwan, and the EU. ## **State-Sponsored Espionage and Persistent Access** Salt Typhoon initiates operations by scanning for and exploiting known CVEs in network edge devices routers, [VPN](https://cyberpress.org/aws-client-vpn-for-windows-flaw/) concentrators, and firewalls often combining automated brute-force methods with unpatched software vulnerabilities. Upon gaining entry, the group deploys resilient, firmware-level implants that survive routine updates, embedding encrypted HTTPS-based command-and-control (C2) channels within legitimate management protocols. These implants beacon at irregular intervals and blend with normal network management traffic, effectively evading detection by security monitoring tools. Through these long-dwell footholds, Salt Typhoon exfiltrates vast quantities of telecom intelligence, including VoIP configurations, session metadata, call detail records (CDRs), lawful intercept logs, and SS7 routing information. A 2024 breach of multiple U.S. carriers, such as AT&T and Verizon, resulted in terabytes of stolen metadata, while a concurrent compromise of several state National Guard VPN gateways yielded network diagrams, administrator credentials, and incident response playbooks assets that can facilitate both real-time surveillance and battlefield preparation. A notable tradecraft feature is Salt Typhoon’s use of bulk-registered domains under fabricated U.S. personas. By registering dozens of English-language domains via ProtonMail and provisioning commercial DV certificates from GoDaddy and Sectigo, the group crafted seemingly benign SaaS portals. However, recurring name servers like irdns.mars.orderbox-dns.com and registrant aliases such as “Shawn Francis” and “Monica Burch” created distinctive attribution signatures that defenders have leveraged to cluster and map the actor’s infrastructure. Underpinning this infrastructure are front companies and contractors based in Chengdu and Beijing Sichuan Juxinhe, Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong, and Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie disguised as legitimate cybersecurity firms. These entities operate domain registration pipelines, host C2 servers, and supply covert tooling under the veneer of commercial services. The 2024 i-SOON GitHub leak revealed automated scripts for domain provisioning and ProtonMail-based OPSEC wrappers, capabilities that [Salt Typhoon](https://dti.domaintools.com/inside-salt-typhoon-chinas-state-corporate-advanced-persistent-threat/) continues to employ. Security agencies now advise that proactive monitoring of passive DNS data, SSL certificate patterns, and registrant overlaps is essential for early warning. Telecom operators should enforce multi-factor authentication for all administrative interfaces, restrict remote management to isolated networks, and rigorously audit firmware integrity on edge devices to detect unauthorized implants. Salt Typhoon’s contractor-driven, dual-use espionage model represents the next evolution in China’s offensive cyber strategy, blending state-directed objectives with commercial execution to achieve scalable, deniable operations. While their semi-industrialized approach yields occasional OPSEC lapses, the group’s advanced capabilities in firmware persistence and metadata harvesting underscore the urgent need for telecom providers to adopt robust [endpoint security](https://cyberpress.org/endpoint-security/) and continuous threat hunting to counter this sophisticated SIGINT threat. ## **Indicator of Compromise (IOCs) – Salt Typhoon Telco Campaigns** ### **Name Server Hosts/IPs:** - irdns.mars.orderbox-dns.com - ns4.1domainregistry.com - ns1.value-domain.com - earth.monovm.com, mars.monovm.com **IP Cluster**: - 162.251.82.125, 162.251.82.252, 172.64.53.3 ### **SSL Certificate Indicators:** - **Common Names (CN)**: - \\*.myorderbox.com - www.solveblemten.com - **Issuers**: - GoDaddy Secure CA – G2 - Sectigo RSA DV CA **Find this Story Interesting!

At a press conference, he alleged that Modi and Amit Shah were behaving like propaganda ministers of the BJP while the nation needed a prime minister and a home minister to deal with extant challenges. \"Trump is mocking India and Narendra Modi. We are unable to respond to him, let alone seek answers from him. This government has failed on the foreign policy front. 7 Aug 2025, 02:00:28 PM IST ## Trump Tariffs India LIVE: ‘PM dancing to tunes of US…’ slams Tejashwi Yadav \\| Watch RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav said, “Trump has imposed total 50 per cent tariff... Trump has said 28 times that he brokered ceasefire (between India and Pakistan), however, the PM is yet to break his silence.” “The PM has not said that Trump is lying. The PM has become so weak that he is dancing to the tunes of the US,” he claimed. “They will come to Bihar and say we are 'Vishwaguru'... what kind of 'Vishwaguru'?” he asked. 7 Aug 2025, 01:57:39 PM IST ## Trump Tariffs India LIVE: ‘Trump's move is self-destructive,’ says market expert \\| WATCH Market Expert Sharad Kohli on US President Donald Trump announcing additional 25% tariff on India, said, “Trump's move is self-destructive. He is trying to create animosity with such a strong ally.” 7 Aug 2025, 01:47:17 PM IST ## Trump Tariffs India LIVE: ‘You kept mum when…’: Kharge slams Indian govt for ‘disaster’ foreign policy Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge slammed the Modi government's “disastrously dithering” foreign policy and claimed they are clueless on how to deal with it. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi \"failed\" to negotiate a trade deal with the United States despite several months of negotiations and now Trump is \"intimidating and coercing us\". In a post on X, the Congress chief said India's national interest is supreme. He said any nation that arbitrarily penalises India for \"our time-tested policy of strategic autonomy, which is embedded in the ideology of Non-alignment, doesn't understand the steel frame India is made of\". \"From the threats of the 7th fleet to the sanctions of Nuclear tests, we have navigated our relationship with the US with self-respect and dignity. Trump's 50% Tariffs comes at a time when our own diplomacy is disastrously dithering,\" he claimed. \"Narendra Modi ji, You kept mum when Trump claimed that he brokered the ceasefire. He has claimed at least 30 times and counting. On November 30, 2024, Trump had threatened to impose a 100% tariff on BRICS nations. PM Modi was sitting there, visibly smirking, while Trump declared 'BRICS dead',\" Kharge alleged. 7 Aug 2025, 01:35:03 PM IST ## Trump Tariffs India LIVE: ‘Our pharmaceutical industry will collapse,’ says MP Pappu Yadav Independent MP Pappu Yadav expressed concern over newly imposed US tarrifs and warned of serious consequences for India's pharma sector. “Because of the 50% tariff that the US has imposed on us, our pharmaceutical industry will collapse.

Chidambaram told ANI, “The special relationship which the Indian administration claimed to have with President Trump, doesn't exist. After the first 25%, instead of coming down, it has only gone up. Which means that the relationship has broken down. I don't know the motive of President Trump, but this is not a formal relationship, and there seems to be no back-channelling, which is easing things up between India and America.” 7 Aug 2025, 01:15:23 PM IST ## Trump Tariffs India LIVE: ‘Weak foreign policy,’ Congress MP slams govt after additional 25% tariff on India Congress MP Rajeev Shukla on Thursday strongly criticised US President Donald Trump for imposing an additional 25 per cent tariff on India over its purchase of Russian oil. Calling the move \"very wrong,\" Shukla urged the Indian government to issue a strong response, while accusing it of pursuing a \"weak foreign policy.\" Speaking to ANI, Shukla said,\"This is very wrong. It is not right for a leader to say such things about a country. Our foreign policy is weak, but despite this, we should firmly oppose it. The entire country is united.\" 7 Aug 2025, 01:07:43 PM IST ## Trump Tariffs India LIVE: PM Modi's strong message amid Trump tariffs PM Narendra Modi said that India will never compromise on the interests of farmers and fishermen, even if that means personally paying a heavy price for it. His remarks are seen as a veiled response to US President Donald Trump's tariff threats on India. “For us, the interest of our farmers is our top priority. India will never compromise on the interests of farmers, fishermen and dairy farmers. I know personally, I will have to pay a heavy price for it, but I am ready for it. Today, India is ready for the country's farmers, fishermen and dairy farmers,” Narendra Modi said, speaking at the MS Swaminathan Centenary International Conference in Delhi.

The trade deal has been struck over the US demand for greater access to India's agricultural and dairy market. It wants reduced tariffs on products like corn, soybeans, apples, almonds and ethanol, as well as increased access for US dairy products. New Delhi is, however, resisting these demands as these will have a direct bearing on farmers. But before a US-India deal could be reached, Trump launched a scathing attack on India over New Delhi's business dealings with Russia – Russia launched a war on Ukraine over three years ago. Frustrated over not being able to end the war – as Trump portrays himself as a peacemaker – Trump has started targeting the countries that have business deals with Moscow.

Credit: FOTOGRIN - shutterstock.com A Chinese state-sponsored hacker group called RedNovember has conducted a global espionage campaign targeting critical infrastructure between June 2024 and July 2025, compromising defense contractors, government agencies, and major corporations while exploiting vulnerabilities faster than organizations could deploy security patches. The attacks included breaches of at least two US defense contractors and more than 30 Panamanian government agencies as part of a systematic targeting across the US, Europe, Asia, and South America, according to cybersecurity firm [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/rednovember-targets-government-defense-and-technology-organizations). The threat group deployed the Go-based Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike, and SparkRAT to maintain persistent network access after exploiting flaws in enterprise appliances, researchers said in the report. “The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms,” the report added. Recorded Future’s Insikt Group had previously tracked the activity under the designation TAG-100 before attributing it to Chinese state-sponsored operations. Microsoft also tracks overlapping activity from this group as Storm-2077. ## Systematic exploitation of enterprise network devices RedNovember systematically targeted internet-facing appliances that form the backbone of enterprise network security, successfully compromising SonicWall VPN devices, Ivanti Connect Secure appliances, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, F5 BIG-IP systems, Sophos SSL VPN products, and Fortinet FortiGate firewalls, researchers found. The hackers exploited both recently disclosed vulnerabilities and older flaws that organizations had failed to patch. RedNovember compromised two US defense contractors in April 2025 using CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti appliances – flaws for which patches had been available since January 2024, the report said. A European engine manufacturer that produces aerospace components was breached through its SonicWall VPN device, while multiple law firms fell victim through compromised network appliances, researchers documented. ## 72-hour vulnerability exploitation window RedNovember demonstrated the ability to weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities faster than most organizations could deploy patches, researchers found. When researchers published proof-of-concept code for Check Point VPN vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 on [May 30, 2024](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/), RedNovember was attacking vulnerable systems by June 3. That campaign hit at least 60 organizations across Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the United States within four days, according to the report. Similar patterns emerged with Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, with RedNovember consistently exploiting disclosed vulnerabilities within 72 hours of public exploit code availability, the research showed. ## Open-source tools masked attribution Rather than developing custom malware, RedNovember relied heavily on publicly available tools, including the Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework, and SparkRAT remote access tool, all written in the Go programming language, researchers found. The hackers used variants of the LESLIELOADER tool to deploy SparkRAT on compromised systems, with samples first detected in March 2024, according to the analysis. RedNovember also leveraged legitimate services, including vulnerability scanning tools like PortSwigger’s Burp Suite and VPN services, including ExpressVPN and Cloudflare’s Warp, to manage their infrastructure. “RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution,” researchers explained in the report. ## Global targeting across multiple sectors The group heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, while also conducting surveillance of government agencies across Panama, and targeting entities in Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, the report said. The hackers maintained persistent access to compromised networks for months, with some intrusions lasting from July 2024 through March 2025, according to the research. A Taiwanese IT company remained compromised throughout this period, with researchers tracking communications to Pantegana command-and-control servers. The hacker group also targeted organizations handling sensitive business negotiations, successfully compromising an American law firm involved in debt restructuring for a Chinese company and attempting to breach a major US newspaper, the report found. ## Coordinated timing with geopolitical events Several RedNovember campaigns coincided with significant geopolitical developments, researchers observed. The systematic surveillance of more than 30 Panamanian government agencies occurred just weeks after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an expanded partnership to counter Chinese influence in the canal zone. The targeting of Taiwan facilities, which house both military installations and semiconductor research operations, coincided with Chinese military exercises involving 90 warships around the island in December 2024, the report noted. “The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China,” the researchers wrote. The systematic targeting of internet-facing appliances across multiple vendor platforms indicated that organizations need enhanced monitoring and rapid patch deployment capabilities for network infrastructure devices, the report suggested. RedNovember “will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release,” researchers added in the report.

To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.

Cyclone Hudhud, earthquake in China, monsoon floods in India and Pakistan led to loss of over 7000 lives in Asia in 2014, with a total cost of disaster events estimated at USD 52 billion. Globally, total economic losses from all disaster events were USD 110 billion in 2014, where Asia contributed 47% to the total global losses. Out of the total loss, only USD 5.2 billion worth of losses were insured in Asia. There still lies a big protection gap with the lack of insurance cover in many countries in Asia. Economic development, population growth, a high concentration of assets in exposed areas and a changing climate are increasing the economic cost of natural disasters. These, if not accompanied by a commensurate increase in insurance penetration, will likely result in a widening protection gap over the long term. [Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6cbsSDuMRmPCIgXS2t) Heavy monsoon in northern India and Pakistan In early September, monsoon rains in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir in India and the neighbouring region in Pakistan resulted in the worst flooding in 60 years. At least 665 perished and over 200 000 houses were destroyed. However, the rural communities were hit harder as the floods came at harvest time for rice and apple crops, the livelihood of many farmers. Together, the total losses in India and Pakistan were USD 5.9 billion, and insured losses were at least USD 0.2 billion.The total losses from the destruction of housing in India were at USD 4.4 billion. Cyclone Hudhud caused the largest loss from a tropical cyclone The biggest storm of the Pacific and Indian Ocean season was Cyclone Hudhud in October. Hudhud made landfall near the port city of Visakhapatnam in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh with winds of up to 200 km/124 miles per hour and a storm surge of up to three metres in some areas. The storm brought heavy rains and flooding in neighbouring states also. With a population of 2 million, Visakhapatnam is the third largest city on India's east coast. The total losses were estimated at USD 7 billion, the largest of all natural catastrophes in the world in 2014. However, the insured losses were a fraction of the total at just USD 0.6 billion. The cyclone claimed 68 lives but the number could have been much higher. Early warning and evacuation of up to 400 000 people ahead of the storm saved many lives. ### Also Read [**Asia Pack reports standalone net loss of Rs 0.12 crore in the December 2014 quarter**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/asia-pack-reports-standalone-net-loss-of-rs-0-12-crore-in-the-december-2014-quarter-115021001278_1.html) [**Asia Pack reports standalone net loss of Rs 0.09 crore in the September 2014 quarter**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/asia-pack-reports-standalone-net-loss-of-rs-0-09-crore-in-the-september-2014-quarter-114111300121_1.html) [**Reuters poll - Asia easing views hurt FX sentiment**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/reuters/reuters-poll-asia-easing-views-hurt-fx-sentiment-115020500537_1.html) [**Asia Pack to hold board meeting**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/asia-pack-to-hold-board-meeting-114110600357_1.html) [**Asia Pack to hold board meeting**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/asia-pack-to-hold-board-meeting-115013100492_1.html) [**US to offer smart transport solutions for Allahabad, Ajmer and Visakhapatnam**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/us-to-offer-smart-transport-solutions-for-allahabad-ajmer-and-visakhapatnam-115040900957_1.html) [**Indian Railways' Freight Loading Up By 4.18 Per Cent During Fiscal 2014-15**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/indian-railways-freight-loading-up-by-4-18-per-cent-during-fiscal-2014-15-115040900956_1.html) [**Shri Rajiv Pratap Rudy Launches Human Resource and Skill Requirement Reports for 24 Priority Sectors**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/shri-rajiv-pratap-rudy-launches-human-resource-and-skill-requirement-reports-for-24-priority-sectors-115040900771_1.html) [**Ind-Ra: Decline in Gas Prices to Drive a Marginal Reduction In Urea Subsidy**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/ind-ra-decline-in-gas-prices-to-drive-a-marginal-reduction-in-urea-subsidy-115040900769_1.html) [**Union Tourism Minister Dr Mahesh Sharma launches the 'Visit Kerala 2015' Initiative of Kerala Tourism**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/union-tourism-minister-dr-mahesh-sharma-launches-the-visit-kerala-2015-initiative-of-kerala-tourism-115040900768_1.html) Bulk of convective storm activity in India and Bangladesh In Asia, the bulk of the severe convective storm activity occurs in India and Bangladesh, most often in the pre-monsoon period from March-May. The storms are classified by wind speed, with speeds of 42 meters per second/151 km per hour or higher referred to as tornadoes, and below that as nor'westers. The four deadliest tornadoes on sigma records were all in Bangladesh and the fifth and sixth in India. Total economic losses were lower in 2014 Global insured losses from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters were USD 35 billion in 2014, down from USD 44 billion in 2013 and well below the USD 64 billion-average of the previous 10 years. Around 12,700 people lost their lives in all disaster events, down from as many as 27,000 in 2013, making it one of the lowest numbers ever recorded in a single year. The number of victims of disaster events in 2014 was one of the lowest recorded. Improvements in early warning systems and emergency preparedness meant fewer victims than otherwise may have been. Progress in local prevention and mitigation measures to strengthen resilience will be a key variable in total victim numbers in the future, especially if climate change leads to more frequent natural catastrophe events. **_Powered by_ Capital Market - Live News** [Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.

In a fiery post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said that while India is a “friend”, it has imposed some of the “highest tariffs” on the United States and maintained “obnoxious” non-monetary trade barriers.

Donald Trump's 25% tariff announcement was met with strong criticism from Opposition leaders. Indian trade bodies have also voiced disappointment, with leaders in India’s gems and jewellery sector warning of short-term disruptions, job losses, and higher prices for US buyers, reported ANI.

So, there's a lot at stake here for both countries...The President is not signalling a lack of confidence or a lack of interest in this strategic partnership. He's simply deploying a negotiating tactic that he has used in the past with very close partners and allies...I hope that our Indian friends will keep that in mind as well as they work through these issues,\" says former US Assistant State Secretary, Nisha Biswal. 31 Jul 2025, 06:49:57 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: Trump tariff on India can cut full year GDP rate by 20 bps, says expert “The 25% tariff rate is certainly a negative development as it compares to lower rate for peers such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines which compete with India in a similar category of labour-intensive products and electronic goods. The currency market had clearly priced this eventually as the USDINR pair moved by more than 70 paise today. The exact details of the tariffs on the exempted items such as pharma and the ones that were charged at a differential rate such as iron, steel and auto is unknown as of now, but inclusion of pharma into tariffs should be incremental negative for India’s exports as US accounts for more than 30% of India’s pharma exports. If no deal is signed by Sept-October, we see a downside to full year GDP growth estimate for India by 20 bps,” says Garima Kapoor, Economist and Executive Vice President, Elara Capital. 31 Jul 2025, 06:33:27 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: Trump says India willing to cut tariffs ‘substantially’ “We had a tremendous trade deficit.

They have one of the highest tariffs in the world. Now, they are willing to cut it very substantially. But we will see what happens. We are talking to India now. We will see what happens.

So it's partially BRICS and it's partially trade,” Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday. 31 Jul 2025, 12:23:39 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: 'This is India’s moment to scale up,' says PHDCCI Chief CEO and Secretary General of PHDCCI, Ranjeet Mehta, said: \"We are now entering an era of new alignments in the global supply chain. The US is also recalibrating its trade policy by imposing tariffs on major exporting economies like China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and India.

We will have many more options for exporting to other countries. It will hurt us as the US is a big market for the Gem and Jewelery industry. It will affect us, but it will not hamper us,\" Gupta told ANI. 30 Jul 2025, 11:52:10 PM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: 'We’ve got options' - India industry leader hits back at US \"Given the current scenario, India has already found alternative routes.

Year after year we hear of the same hazards seemingly striking in the same places, [be it floods in northern India or Pakistan](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/6304/war-is-boring-afghan-forces-deploy-for-pakistan-flood-relief), droughts in the Horn of Africa or typhoons in the Philippines. Yet, far from the media glare, localized and low-intensity recurrent disasters wear down the resilience of communities around the world through displacement and the loss of livelihoods. Unlike in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2005 Pakistan earthquake or [the 2010 Haiti earthquake](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/6089/haiti-relief-aid-comes-with-sovereignty-setback-attached), no foreign military assistance has been requested to respond to natural disasters in the past three years—nor forcefully offered, as happened after Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar in 2008. Nor did any disaster claim tens of thousands of lives in 2012. But even in the absence of “mega-disasters,” the human and financial consequences are massive: More than 30 million people were displaced worldwide by natural disasters in 2012; the total cost of damages was estimated at $140 billion. Meanwhile, the World Bank warns that the population of large cities exposed to tropical storms and earthquakes will more than double, from 680 million in 2000 to 1.5 billion in 2050. ## Keep reading for free Already a subscriber?

Got it Normal text sizeLarger text sizeVery large text size **Taipei/London**: United States officials were alarmed in 2023 when they discovered that Chinese state-controlled hackers had infiltrated critical US infrastructure with malicious code that could wreck power grids, communications systems and water supplies. The threat was serious enough that then-CIA director William Burns made a secret trip to Beijing to confront his Chinese counterpart. He warned China’s minister of state security that there would be “serious consequences” for Beijing if it unleashed the malware. The tone of the meeting, details of which have not been previously reported, was professional and it appeared the message was delivered. For decades, China has used for-hire hackers to break into computer networks and systems.Credit: Fairfax Media But since that meeting, which was described by two former US officials, China’s intrusions have only escalated. (The former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly about the sensitive meeting.) US and European officials say China’s Ministry of State Security, the civilian spy agency often called the MSS, in particular, has emerged as the driving force behind China’s most sophisticated cyber operations. In recent disclosures, officials revealed another immense, years-long intrusion by hackers who have been collectively called Salt Typhoon, one that may have stolen information about nearly every American and [targeted dozens of other countries](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5ksvn). Some countries hit by Salt Typhoon warned in an unusual statement that the data stolen could provide Chinese intelligence services with the capability to “identify and track their targets’ communications and movements around the world”. Loading The attack underscored how the Ministry of State Security has evolved into a formidable cyberespionage agency capable of audacious operations that can evade detection for years, experts said. For decades, China has used for-hire hackers to break into computer networks and systems. These operatives sometimes mixed espionage with commercial data theft or were sloppy, exposing their presence. In the recent operation by Salt Typhoon, however, intruders linked to the MSS found weaknesses in systems, burrowed into networks, spirited out data, hopped between compromised systems and erased traces of their presence. “Salt Typhoon shows a highly skilled and strategic side to MSS cyber operations that has been missed with the attention on lower-quality contract hackers,” said Alex Joske, the author of a book on the ministry. Advertisement For Washington, the implication of China’s growing capability is clear: in a future conflict, China could put US communications, power and infrastructure at risk. China’s biggest hacking campaigns had been “strategic operations” intended to intimidate and deter rivals, said Nigel Inkster, a senior adviser for cybersecurity and China at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. “If they succeed in remaining on these networks undiscovered, that potentially gives them a significant advantage in the event of a crisis,” said Inkster, formerly director of operations and intelligence in the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. “If their presence is – as it has been – discovered, it still exercises a very significant deterrent effect; as in, ‘Look what we could do to you if we wanted’.” ### The rise of the MSS China’s cyber advances reflect decades of investment to try to match, and eventually rival, the US National Security Agency and Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ. Loading China’s leaders founded the Ministry of State Security in 1983, mainly to track dissidents and perceived foes of Communist Party rule. The ministry engaged in online espionage but was long overshadowed by the Chinese military, which ran extensive cyberspying operations. After taking power as China’s top leader in 2012, Xi Jinping moved quickly to reshape the MSS. He seemed unsettled by the threat of US surveillance to China’s security, and in a 2013 speech pointed to the [revelations of former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-hv6ys). Xi purged the ministry of senior officials accused of corruption and disloyalty. He reined in the hacking role of the Chinese military, elevating the ministry as the country’s primary cyberespionage agency. He put national security at the core of his agenda with new laws and by establishing a new commission. “At this same time, the intelligence requirements imposed on the security apparatus start to multiply, because Xi wanted to do more things abroad and at home,” said Matthew Brazil, a senior analyst at BluePath Labs who has co-written a history of China’s espionage services. Since around 2015, the MSS had moved to bring its far-flung provincial offices under tighter central control, said experts. Chen Yixin, the current minister, has demanded that local state security offices follow Beijing’s orders without delay. Security officials, he said on a recent inspection of the north-east, must be both “red and expert” – absolutely loyal to the party while also adept in technology. After taking power as China’s top leader in 2012, Xi Jinping moved quickly to reshape the MSS.Credit: Getty Images “It all essentially means that the Ministry of State Security now sits atop a system in which it can move its pieces all around the chessboard,” said Edward Schwarck, a researcher at the University of Oxford who is writing a dissertation on China’s state security. Chen was the official who met with Burns in May 2023. He gave nothing away when confronted with the details of the cyber campaign, telling Burns he would let his superiors know about the US concerns, the former officials said. ### The architect of China’s cyberpower The Ministry of State Security operates largely in the shadows, its officials rarely seen or named in public. There was one exception: Wu Shizhong, who was a senior official in Bureau 13, the “technical reconnaissance” arm of the ministry. Loading Wu was unusually visible, turning up at meetings and conferences in his other role as director of the China Information Technology Security Evaluation Centre. Officially, the centre vets digital software and hardware for security vulnerabilities before it can be used in China. Unofficially, foreign officials and experts say, the centre comes under the control of the MSS and provided a direct pipeline of information about vulnerabilities and hacking talent. Wu has not publicly said he served in the security ministry, but a Chinese university website in 2005 described him as a state security bureau head in a notice about a meeting, and investigations by Crowd Strike and other cybersecurity firms have also described his state security role. “Wu Shizhong is widely recognised as a leading figure in the creation of MSS cyber capabilities,” Joske said. In 2013, Wu pointed to two lessons for China: Snowden’s disclosures about American surveillance and the use by the United States of a virus to sabotage Iran’s nuclear facilities. “The core of cyber offence and defence capabilities is technical prowess,” he said, stressing the need to control technologies and exploit their weaknesses. China, he added, should create “a national cyber offence and defence apparatus”. China’s commercial tech sector boomed in the years that followed, and state security officials learned how to put domestic companies and contractors to work, spotting and exploiting flaws and weak spots in computer systems, several cybersecurity experts said. The US National Security Agency has also hoarded knowledge of software flaws for its own use. But China has an added advantage: it can tap its own tech companies to feed information to the state. “MSS was successful at improving the talent pipeline and the volume of good offensive hackers they could contract to,” said Dakota Cary, a researcher who focuses on China’s efforts to develop its hacking capabilities at SentinelOne. “This gives them a significant pipeline for offensive tools.” The Chinese government also imposed rules requiring that any newly found software vulnerabilities be reported first to a database that analysts say is operated by the MSS, giving security officials early access. Other policies reward tech firms with payments if they meet monthly quotas of finding flaws in computer systems and submitting them to the state security-controlled database. “It’s a prestige thing and it’s good for a company’s reputation,” Mei Danowski, the co-founder of Natto Thoughts, a company that advises clients on cyber threats, said of the arrangement. “These business people don’t feel like they are doing something wrong. They feel like they are doing something for their country.” **This article originally appeared in [_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/28/world/asia/how-chinas-secretive-spy-agency-became-a-cyber-powerhouse.html).** **_Get a note directly from our foreign_** **_correspondents_** **_on what’s making headlines around the world._** [**_Sign up for our weekly What in the World newsletter_**](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56l7u) **_._** Save Log in, [register](https://smh.myfairfax.com.au/channel/zHE9EWDHf1XPuz3Phk0YIg/members/signups/new?callback_uri=) or [subscribe](https://subscribe.smh.com.au/?promote_channel=HI_HL_GNL) to save articles for later. - [Cyber warfare](https://www.smh.com.au/topic/cyber-warfare-1mow) - [China](https://www.smh.com.au/topic/china-89a) - [USA](https://www.smh.com.au/topic/united-states-of-america-gd5) - [Xi Jinping](https://www.smh.com.au/topic/xi-jinping-jg0) - [CIA](https://www.smh.com.au/topic/central-intelligence-agency-64d) - [For subscribers](https://www.smh.com.au/subscriber-centre) - [Infrastructure](https://www.smh.com.au/topic/infrastructure-hqi) Loading",

The objective of the program is to help India mitigate the risks and vulnerability of its people to natural disasters, especially cyclones. The first phase is financed through a Credit from the IDA (International Development Association), complemented with **$64 million** from the Government’s budget. India is highly vulnerable to natural hazards, particularly earthquakes, floods, droughts, cyclones and landslides. Studies indicate that natural disaster losses equate up to 2 percent of India’s GDP and up to 12 percent of federal government revenues. About 5,700 kilometers of India’s coastline is exposed to severe cyclones and approximately 40% of India’s population lives within 100 km of the coastline. Analyzed data for the period 1980-2000 indicates that on an average, annually, 370 million people are exposed to cyclones in India. The aim of the project (NCRMP-I) is to improve early warning and communication systems; enhance capacity of local communities to respond to disasters; improve access to emergency shelters, evacuation, and protection against cyclone related hazards such as wind storms, flooding and storm surge in high risk areas; and strengthen disaster risk management capacities at the central, state and local levels. The program is expected to include at least three phases. Phase I includes the states of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Phase II will be open to the remaining high risk states or other coastal states that are ready to join. Rest of the coastal states will be covered under phase III. Each of the new phases will be appraised and approved separately to confirm the implementation readiness. This phased approach will help incorporate lessons from the earlier phases as well as include new ideas and advancements in technology in the management of risks. _“As climate change and variability become more pronounced, hazard events are set to grow, both in terms of frequency and intensity. Globally, the understanding of the role of disaster risk mitigation and preparedness initiatives in reducing the overall impacts of a disaster, has grown,”_ said **N.V.V. Raghava, World Bank Senior Infrastructure Specialist and Project Team Leader.** _“The project aims to mitigate the risks and vulnerability of coastal communities to cyclone and other hydrometeorological hazards by reducing the social, economic and financial impacts of future disasters.”_ India’s response to two of the biggest disasters in this current decade, the Gujarat earthquake and the Asian tsunami, has been efficient and very effective. Through this period, India has made great strides in moving from reactive emergency response to being proactive in implementing disaster preparedness and risk reduction initiatives. India enacted the Disaster Management Act in 2005 and established the National Disaster Management Authority and State Disaster Management Authorities. The credit is provided by the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s concessionary lending arm and has 35 years to maturity and a 10-year grace period. * * * ###### Media Contacts In Delhi Nandita Roy Tel : 91-11-41479220 [nroy@worldbank.org](mailto:nroy@worldbank.org) In Delhi Mohamad Al-Arief Tel : 91-11-41479210 [malarief@worldbank.org](mailto:malarief@worldbank.org) Karina Manasseh Tel : Manasseh [kmanasseh@worldbank.org](mailto:kmanasseh@worldbank.org) * * * ###### RELATED - [India National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (1)](https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P092217?lang=en) * * * * * * - [India](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/india) - [South Asia](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/sar) - [Climate Change](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange) - [Fragility, Conflict and Violence](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/fragilityconflictviolence) Api ![](https://www.worldbank.org/etc/designs/wbr/clientlibs/img/loaderwb.svg) Api ![](https://www.worldbank.org/etc/designs/wbr/clientlibs/img/loaderwb.svg) * * * ###### Newsletters [Welcome](https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/bold-new-worldbankorg)",

This demonstrates how cyber operations have evolved beyond merely gathering intelligence. When first identified by US government partners back in mid-2023, the campaign by the Salt Typhoon group was assessed as a targeted espionage effort against US and allied government systems. It involved stealthy intrusions, selective data theft and probing of networks in a handful of countries. At the time, the effect was thought to be limited and largely confined to government targets. But August 2025 disclosures have shown just how broad the campaign truly has been. The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has [publicly attributed](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/countering-chinese-state-sponsored-actors-compromise-of-networks-worldwide-to-feed-global-espionage-system) the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. They are central to rivalry. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge. The Indo-Pacific is the epicentre of 21st-century competition. China and the US vie for influence, while South Korea, India, Japan and Southeast Asian countries all face mounting digital vulnerabilities. With the digital economy of Southeast Asian nations expected to surpass US$1 [trillion](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/asean-building-trust-digital-economy/) by 2030, growth is driving their prosperity but also compounding risk. Chinese-sponsored hackers have been targeting critical infrastructure for a long time. Suspected Chinese hackers disrupted India’s [port](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/securing-indian-ports-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-and-the-road-ahead) logistics in 2020, and repeated intrusions have targeted Japanese, South Korean and Australian energy grids, telecom systems and government networks. Cyber operations are applied to traditional hotspots—such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait—by threatening disruption without any shots being fired. Beyond the sheer number of cyber incidents, patterns in their objectives distinguish cyber operations in the Indo-Pacific from those in other regions. Three stand out: probing, pressuring, and threshold testing. Probing operations aim to identify and target system vulnerabilities. Chinese threat group APT41 often employs this method. The [group](https://cyberscoop.com/apt41-fireeye-china/) has conducted espionage operations across healthcare, telecoms and government agencies for many years. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has perfected a distinct form of probing: cyber-heists, ranging from the 2016 Bangladesh Bank [hack](https://cyber.uk/areas-of-cyber-security/cyber-security-threat-groups-2/nation-state-hackers-case-study-bangladesh-bank-heist/) to ongoing cryptocurrency thefts that directly fund Pyongyang’s weapons programs. These operations map vulnerabilities and generate funds, while staying below the threshold of conventional war. Australia has been a repeated target of pressuring tactics, with the [breaches](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/reports-and-statistics/annual-cyber-threat-report-2023-2024) of critical infrastructure widely interpreted as signaling that Canberra’s alignment with Washington has costs. Taiwan is another case in point. During its 2024 elections, disinformation campaigns, distributed denial-of-service attacks on government portals, and breaches of media outlets sought to [undermine](https://saferinternetlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Panel-4-Summer.pdf) confidence in the democratic process. These pressures were synchronised with more visible coercion, such as military exercises and air incursions, illustrating how digital operations complement kinetic manoeuvres. Some cyber campaigns appear to be aimed at threshold-testing, blurring the line between espionage and sabotage. In the Vietnam–China cyber [clashes](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/vietnams-securitisation-of-cybersecurity-under-growing-chinese-cyber-threats/) related to South China Sea disputes, Vietnamese hackers allegedly targeted Chinese government websites. Similarly, the 2021 Japan Olympics cyberattacks, which [some](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54600098) attributed to Russian actors, demonstrated how geopolitical rivalries could extend into civilian life. Together, these incidents outline a region where states and non-state actors continually challenge each other’s resolve. Skirmishes might not cause immediate destruction, but they foster digital coercion and raise the risk of escalation. Cyber campaigns are not just harassment; some signal a potential for escalation. Attacks against Taiwan’s government networks have spiked during Chinese military drills, showing how cyber and kinetic tools are increasingly integrated. The danger lies in miscalculation. A ransomware strike that disrupts Japan’s energy grid or South Korea’s financial sector could be interpreted as state-backed aggression, prompting military responses. In cyberspace, where [attribution](https://academic.oup.com/isp/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/isp/ekae022/7903056) is murky and timeframes are compressed, escalation could outrun diplomacy. Repeated incidents also risk normalising cyber coercion as a standard tool of statecraft. If probing and pressure go unchallenged, adversaries will keep pushing until the region faces a full-scale digital confrontation. The Indo-Pacific has become a laboratory for cyber conflict, setting global precedents. Europe, Latin America and Africa should watch closely: today’s coercion in Asia could become tomorrow’s global standard. Cyber skirmishes in the Indo-Pacific mark the cutting edge of strategic competition, where adversaries test limits and normalise coercion. The region’s growing dependence on digital infrastructure, combined with its strategic volatility, makes it a perilous testing ground for cyber conflict globally. The choice is stark: treat these incidents as minor disruptions until one sparks a crisis, or act to strengthen resilience, deepen cooperation and set rules for [responsible](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/curbing-the-cost-of-cybersecurity-fragmentation-an-agenda-for-harmonisation-across-the-indo-pacific/) behaviour in cyberspace. If governments fail, adversaries will decide the thresholds for acceptable action—and by then it may be too late.

The hacking campaign, nicknamed Salt Typhoon by Microsoft, has breached companies like Verizon, AT&T, and Lumen, and hasn’t been fully evicted from networks yet \\[4\\]. Analysts have reported that this could potentially be one of the largest and most egregious cyber espionage campaigns ever in terms of size and scope \\[3\\]. A majority of the information intercepted by the hackers involved either people working for the government or people involved in politics \\[1\\]. Examples of previously targeted individuals include President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris \\[1\\]. ## Background With growing tensions between China and the US over things like trade, military build-up, and Taiwan, China has invested a lot of time and effort into their cybersecurity/cyber espionage military departments. Emphasis has been put on things like intellectual property theft, industrial espionage/sabotage, or in this case information gathering. Since the cyber domain is so new, there is a lack of international regulations or consequences for cyber attacks perpetrated by nation-states, making this domain a great medium for rivaling nations. ## Impact This story is currently ongoing and a formal investigation into the scope of this attack has not been done yet. However, some compromised items include certain records, voice calls, and the wiretap system used by the justice department \\[1\\]. Due to the nature of the companies that have been compromised, the theoretical scope of the attacks could reach almost everybody who uses a phone in the United States. Since the attackers have not yet been removed completely from the networks they have compromised, it is important to note that the scope may increase even further. Other miscellaneous information that has been compromised as a result of the attacks include caller and receiver phone numbers, call durations, call types, and the location of cell towers used \\[4\\]. ## Significance Due to this attack, the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has recommended people to harden their systems and devices, be careful what they communicate, and use encrypted communications when possible \\[1\\] \\[2\\]. This attack shows that while people may secure their own communications through things like tough passwords or two-factor authentication, vendors themselves are also vulnerable to attacks. Consumers should do proper research on their vendors to understand the protections that are put in place to safeguard their data from threats. It is up to the consumer to then determine if they can trust the companies with data that they may find confidential. ## References \\[1\\] Collier K., “U.S. officials urge Americans to use encrypted apps amid unprecedented cyberattack,” 2024 [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna182694](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna182694) \\[2\\] Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, “Enhanced Visibility and Hardening Guidance for Communications Infrastructure,” 2024 [https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure) \\[3\\] Luce D., “Chinese hack of telecommunications companies under investigation, NSA chief says,” 2024 [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chinese-hack-telecommunications-companies-investigation-nsa-chief-says-rcna174208](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chinese-hack-telecommunications-companies-investigation-nsa-chief-says-rcna174208) \\[4\\] Vijayan J., “CISA Issues Guidance to Telecom Sector on Salt Typhoon Threat,” 2024 [https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/cisa-issue-guidance-telecoms-salt-typhoon-threat](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/cisa-issue-guidance-telecoms-salt-typhoon-threat) Related Posts - [Hackers Steal $500,000 from Australian Super Funds\\ Hackers Steal $500,000 from Australian Super Funds\\ 4/11/2025](https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/cyber/global-weekly-exec-summary/hackers-steal-500000-from-australian-super-funds/) - [U.S. Department of Justice Seizes 8.2 Million in Cryptocurrency\\ U.S. Department of Justice Seizes 8.2 Million in Cryptocurrency\\ 4/4/2025](https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/cyber/global-weekly-exec-summary/u-s-department-of-justice-seizes-8-2-million-in-cryptocurrency/) - [Interpol Arrests Over 300 for Cyber Crimes in Africa\\ Interpol Arrests Over 300 for Cyber Crimes in Africa\\ 4/4/2025](https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/cyber/global-weekly-exec-summary/interpol-arrests-over-300-for-cyber-crimes-in-africa/)",

    "full_text": "[Security Bloggers Network](https://securityboulevard.com/category/sbn/) [Threats & Breaches](https://securityboulevard.com/category/blogs/threats-breaches/) [by Matthew Rosenquist on September 27, 2025](https://securityboulevard.com/author/matthew-rosenquist/) China has implemented regulations for 1-hour reporting of severe cybersecurity incidents. This would include disruptions that impact over 50% of the people in a province or 10 million people, such as critical infrastructure attacks. The irony is that China is recognized for its advanced and aggressive foreign cyber operations. But there is brilliance in this requirement. China has an excellent perspective in how such attacks can be used to disrupt adversaries and push foreign policy. It doesn’t want to suffer in ways that other nations might and therefore is improving its response and recovery capabilities. In contrast, when the US SEC required public companies to report material outages within 4 days beginning in 2025, there was upheaval with some cybersecurity leaders, stating that it was impossible or at the very least irresponsible. They lobbied Congress to repeal the requirements. Since the regulation took effect, no major issues have arisen from the 4-day requirement. The vast majority of US critical infrastructure is operated by private industry and concealing cybersecurity compromises only benefits the attackers. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is also looking to update rules specifically for US critical infrastructure, mandating a 72-hour notification, but the [final rule may not be published until mid-2026](https://www.dwt.com/blogs/privacy--security-law-blog/2025/09/cisa-delays-cyber-incident-reporting-rules-2026#:~:text=CIRCIA%20and%20the%20CISA%20rule,response%20to%20a%20ransomware%20attack.). China knows something and realizes the importance of early reporting. Even the most aggressive US reporting proposals falls far short of the 1-hour requirement in China. I hope my peers will remain calm, realize the necessity, and support early notification in the US. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from [Information Security Strategy](https://infosecstrategy.blogspot.com/) authored by [Matthew Rosenquist](https://securityboulevard.com/author/0/).

Geophysical hazards affect the Himalayan region in the north and northeastern portions of the country where they rank in high deciles for mortality and lower deciles for GDP impact. Cyclones influence a relatively small area of the country but have high-ranking mortality and GDP weighted impacts. Lastly, both the multi-hazard mortality and GDP maps demonstrate that almost the entire country is significantly impacted by at least one hazard and mortality impacts are particularly concentrated in the north and northeastern regions. | | | | © 2005 Center For Hazards and Risk Research at Columbia University | |",

Following the ceasefire, India and Pakistan's military leaders held a phone call on May 12 to discuss de-escalation. Later, on May 30, a senior Pakistani military official stated that the two countries were close to reaching an agreement to reduce troop deployments along the border to pre-conflict levels, though no such drawdown has yet been observed....",

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

The outlook for the next three years could also be downgraded unless the government and the private sector significantly increase their investment. However, the international economic climate is not conducive to either domestic or foreign investment, even if the direct impact of a potential increase in US tariffs on Indian economic growth would be limited. The recent downward pressure on emerging currencies has not spared the Indian rupee, and the depreciation trend is likely to continue, especially as the new Governor of the Central Bank seems to be focusing on supporting economic growth rather than currency stability. FORECASTS ## Significantly slower growth Following in the footsteps of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Central Statistical Office (CSO) has revised downwards its growth forecasts for the fiscal year (FY) 2024/2025, which will end on 31 March. These revisions (6.6% and 6.4%, respectively, compared with 8.2% for 2023/2024) reflect the economic growth slowdown recorded between July and September 2024. Growth was up just 5.4% year-on-year (y/y), the lowest rate recorded in the last seven quarters. As a result, in the first half of the fiscal year, growth was just 6% compared with 8.2% at the same time last year. This slowdown is due to a marked deceleration in activity in manufacturing and construction. Activity in the services sector remained solid, although decelerating slightly. Only agriculture rebounded. On the demand side, apart from government spending, all components slowed. INDIA: SLIGHT RISE IN INDUTRIAL OUTPUT In the second half of the fiscal year (October-March), economic activity should accelerate, but is not expected to exceed 6.7%, according to the RBI. Base effects should be unfavourable and the rebound modest. Since November 2024, all the indicators have picked up, on both the supply and demand sides. Industrial output has accelerated from its low point in August, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and the rebound in steel and cement production suggests that construction activity has picked up. Rural household consumption should continue to be underpinned by good summer harvests, higher-than-average water reservoir levels and better winter sowing than in 2024. On the other hand, although expected to rise, the rebound in urban household consumption could be more muted. Sales of two-wheel vehicles accelerated significantly in the fourth quarter, while growth in car sales, despite returning to positive territory in October after three months of decline, remains sluggish (+4.4% y/y in November). On the investment front, although the government is likely to accelerate the pace of new infrastructure projects, private entrepreneurs may be more cautious, waiting for a clearer picture of the domestic and international environment. Capacity utilisation rates have reached a plateau and average interest rates on new loans remain more than 40 basis points (bps) higher than last year (in real terms), while the financial situation of companies is less comfortable than at the start of the year (with rising interest charges and a slowdown in profits). Over the next three years, growth is expected to average 6.5%, but downside risks are high and the slowdown in investment is something to keep an eye on. In the absence of a significant rebound, the short- and medium-term growth outlook could be revised downwards. ## Inflation slows thanks to food prices In November, inflation slowed to 5.5% y/y, mainly due to the noticeable deceleration in food prices and a favourable base effect. Excluding food and energy, core inflation remained relatively stable at 3.6%. Over the next few months, inflationary pressures should continue to fall, enabling the RBI to ease monetary policy at its next three monetary policy committees, lowering the key rate to 5.75%, despite the downward pressure on the rupee. Indeed, the new Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seems to be giving priority to supporting growth rather than the stability of its currency. Such a policy is risky, however, as it would fuel inflationary pressures and penalise consumption by the most disadvantaged households, unless it is accompanied by a reduction in import taxes or an expansionary social policy. This would reduce its budgetary margins for increased investment spending. ## External accounts: rising tensions India’s external accounts are structurally robust. Its foreign exchange reserves are plentiful (in mid-January, they covered 1.8 times the country's short-term external financing needs), its current account deficit is moderate (0.8% of GDP on average over the last five years), and its external debt is low (19.3% of GDP). In addition, although India is vulnerable to commodity price shocks, particularly oil as a net importer, it has managed to reduce its exposure by importing oil from Russia at below-market prices. The main areas of concern are the very low level of FDI (which has been falling for two years) and the country's greater vulnerability to external shocks with the inclusion of sovereign bonds in the emerging indices. The current account deficit, which rose slightly in Q2-Q3 2024 (to 1.2% of GDP), is no longer covered by net FDI flows (which fell to just 0.2% of GDP). Despite this, pressures on the balance of payments were limited thanks to foreign portfolio investment. However, since October, as a result of significant capital outflows caused by the prospect of a status quo in US monetary policy, downward pressure on the rupee has increased significantly and foreign exchange reserves have fallen by more than 11.5% (USD -70 bn). In mid-January, the rupee was trading close to INR87 to USD1, an all-time low. This trend is set to continue with the expected rise in the current account deficit and the fall in domestic interest rates. Furthermore, the new Governor of the RBI appears to be adopting a different strategy from that of his predecessor, who had made the stability of the rupee his main objective. Allowing the rupee to depreciate would increase the competitiveness of Indian exports, but it could also attract the attention of the new Trump administration. ## Trump 2.0: what are the consequences? INDIA: EXPORTS TO THE US The potential increase in US tariffs will have a moderate impact on the Indian economy. In 2018, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on some Indian products, in particular steel (25%) and aluminium (10%), which then accounted for around 6% of Indian exports to the US. In 2019, it also abolished the preferential tariff policy (0% customs duty) in force on automotive components, chemical products and nuclear reactors, which then accounted for around 12% of exports. The introduction of these tariffs led to a fall in exports over the following two years (particularly for automotive components), but exports then rebounded strongly. The US has remained India's leading export partner, accounting for 17.6% of its total exports. In 2024, the US trade deficit with India, despite being larger than the US trade deficit with Indonesia and Malaysia, remained modest (USD 45bn) compared with that with China and Vietnam (USD 293 bn and USD 122 bn, respectively). However, as in other Asian countries (apart from Malaysia), this deficit has increased significantly since 2020 (+62%). However, the sharp rise in Indian exports to the US does not reflect a shift of Chinese production to India, but rather a shift of US companies to 'friendly' countries. Although precious stones are still the leading export to the US (13.4% of exports to the US), the share of machinery and electrical equipment has risen sharply since 2020, reaching 13% of goods exported to the US in 2023 (vs. 3.2% in 2018). Exports of smartphones and semiconductors increased by a factor of 3.2 between 2022 and 2023. This very sharp increase is the result of the influx of FDI into these sectors from 2020 onwards. Despite a modest trade surplus with the US, and despite the fact that it has not been accused of manipulating its currency, India, as the ninth largest import partner of the US, could nonetheless face a further increase in US tariffs unless it lowers its customs duties on imported US products. The tariffs applied by India on its imports of US goods averaged 14% in 2023 and 9.6% when taking into account the structure of Indian imports, largely above the weighted average of tarrifs set by the United-States for goods imported from India (2.6%). However, if the new Trump administration were to decide to increase its tariffs on products imported from India, the impact on the Indian economy would be modest. Exports to the US accounted for 2% of its GDP in 2023. The adoption of a 10% tariff on Indian goods exported to the US could generate a 0.2 pp drop in its GDP (assuming that the elasticity of exports to customs duties is 1.3, as indicated in the 2024 study by Haberkorn, Hoang, Lewis, Mix and Moore). If the Trump administration were to spare India, the country could benefit from a redirection of trade flows with the US as a final destination, as the cost of its abundant labour remains much lower than in other Asian countries and its performance in logistics is equivalent to that of Vietnam. However, the government still needs to remove the constraints that weigh on the development of its manufacturing sector and penalise FDIs, which remain strong despite the Modi government's efforts. _Article completed on 20 January 2025_ THE ECONOMISTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS ARTICLE [JohannaMELKA](https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/Teams/Emerging-Countries/Johanna-MELKA/en-US#anchor-E) Team : Emerging Countries [01 58 16 05 84](tel:01%2058%2016%2005%2084) [johanna.melka@bnpparibas.com](mailto:johanna.melka@bnpparibas.com) [PDF - Full publication](https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/pdf/en-US/Perspectives-Emerging-Economies-1st-quarter-2025-2/11/2025,51308) ## Other articles from the same publication Emerging Countries ### World trade: waiting for the audit Since taking office, President Trump has confirmed his threats to raise tariffs, but fears of universal and widespread application have abated somewhat \\[...\\] [Read the article](https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/html/en-US/World-trade-waiting-audit-2/11/2025,51309) China ### China : Adjustment of economic growth drivers After a good start to the year, Chinese economic growth will slow down in 2025 due to still weak domestic demand and the effects of the upcoming protectionist shock on exports \\[...\\] [Read the article](https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/html/en-US/China-Adjustment-economic-growth-drivers-2/11/2025,51310) South Korea ### South Korea: New challenges South Korea's economic growth slowed throughout 2024, with limited prospects for a rebound.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "full_text": "New Delhi: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced the imposition of a 25 percent additional import duty plus penalty on goods imported from India. The duty will come into effect from August 1. The unspecified penalty was imposed on India for purchasing crude oil and military equipment from Russia. The announcement came as a surprise, as the two countries are negotiating a trade agreement. Here is a list of Q&amp;A (questions and answers) to explain the impact of the US move: What is a tariff? These are customs or import duties imposed on the import of goods. The importer has to pay this duty to the government. Normally, companies pass on these taxes to end users. How much tariff is announced on India? The United States has announced that impose a 25 percent tariff plus a penalty for buying Russia’s crude oil and military equipment. However, the US has not specified the quantum of the penalty and how it will be imposed. An executive order from the White House on the 25 percent tariff plus penalty will give clarity on the duty structure. A 10 percent duty (announced on April 2) applies to all goods. Besides, there is a 50 percent tariff on steel and aluminium, and 25 percent on auto and auto parts. These duties are imposed over and above the existing tariffs on Indian goods. For example, textiles attract a 6-9 percent tariff at present, so after adding the 25 percent, Indian textile goods entering the US from August 1 will attract a 31-34 percent duty. A penalty could be added further on this. Why is the US imposing these tariffs? The US has alleged that it faces a significant trade deficit with India, blaming New Delhi for imposing high tariffs on American goods, which it says restricts US exports to the Indian market. What is bilateral trade between India and the US? During 2021-25, the US was India’s largest trading partner in goods. The US accounts for about 18 percent of India’s total exports, 6.22 percent in imports, and 10.73 percent in bilateral trade. In 2024-25, the bilateral trade touched USD 186 billion (USD 86.5 billion exports and USD 45.3 billion imports). With America, India had a trade surplus (the difference between imports and exports) of USD 41 billion in 2024-25. It was USD 35.32 billion in 2023-24 and USD 27.7 billion in 2022-23. In services, India exported an estimated USD 28.7 billion and imported USD 25.5 billion, adding a USD 3.2 billion surplus. Altogether, India ran a total trade surplus of about USD 44.4 billion with the US. However, according to think tank GTRI, the US runs a USD 35-40 billion overall surplus when revenues from education, digital services, financial activities, royalties, and arms trade are factored in. What are the major products traded between the two? In 2024, India’s main exports to the US include: Drug formulations and biologicals (USD 8.1 billion) Telecom instruments (USD 6.5 billion) Precious and semi-precious stones (USD 5.3 billion) Petroleum products (USD 4.1 billion) Vehicle and auto components (USD 2.8 billion) Gold and other precious metal jewellery (USD 3.2 billion) Ready-made garments of cotton, including accessories (USD 2.8 billion) Products of iron and steel (USD 2.7 billion) Imports include: Crude oil (USD 4.5 billion) Petroleum products (USD 3.6 billion) Coal, coke (USD 3.4 billion) Cut and polished diamonds (USD 2.6 billion) Electric machinery (USD 1.4 billion) Aircraft, spacecraft and parts (USD 1.3 billion) Gold (USD 1.3 billion) What will be the impact of the tariffs on this trade? Import duty makes goods expensive in the importing country. Besides, a few other factors also play a role in this. For example, duty on India’s competitor nations such as Bangladesh (35 pc), Vietnam (20 pc) and Thailand (36 pc); and quality and standards of items. According to exporters, Indian labour-intensive goods such as garments, leather and non-leather footwear, gems and jewellery, carpets and handicrafts may get impacted due to this duty. What will be the US tariffs on key Indian goods from August 1? Telecom – 25 pc; gems and jewellery – 30-38.5 pc (5-13.5 pc at present); food and agri goods – 29-30 pc (14-15 pc currently); apparel 12 pc plus 25 pc. Penalty component may also be there from August 1. According to experts, no. The US also imposes high duties on items like dairy products (188 percent), Fruits and vegetables (132 percent), Coffee, tea, cocoa and spices (53 percent), Cereals and food preparations (193 percent), Oilseeds, fats and oils (164 percent), beverages and tobacco (150 percent), Minerals and metals (187 percent), and Chemicals (56 percent). India’s average tariff rate of 17 percent is higher than the US’s 3.3 percent, but similar to other major economies like South Korea (13.4 percent) and China (7.5 percent).

This decrease in value forced the company to cancel its $2.4 billion share sale on Jan. 31, and on Feb. 6-7, Adani announced his intention to pre-pay loans, including loans backed by Adani Group shares, to calm investor sentiment and demonstrate that the conglomerate has sufficient liquidity.

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power.

(YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images) In early fall, we examined the implications of increasing energy prices, including their potential to generate social unrest. Since then, many countries have witnessed more generalized inflation -- which is causing prices to rise for a variety of essentials, not just the energy that consumers pay to heat their homes, cook their food and drive their cars -- suggesting that unrest risks are expanding as more countries and more items are affected. As concerns grow that inflationary pressures will persist long into 2022 it is worth examining what countries may be most vulnerable to inflation-driven unrest and how it could play out. To do so, looking back at previous episodes of unrest linked to price rises can help evaluate what could happen in the coming year....

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Thus far, only sporadic violent plots and a few low-level attacks have targeted AI infrastructure like data centers.

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

    "full_text": "**Image Credits:** Prakash Singh / Bloomberg / Getty Images [Security](https://techcrunch.com/category/security/) # Thousands of Indian bank transfer records found spilling online after security lapse [Jagmeet Singh](https://techcrunch.com/author/jagmeet-singh/) [Zack Whittaker](https://techcrunch.com/author/zack-whittaker/) 8:50 AM PDT · September 26, 2025 A data spill from an unsecured cloud server has exposed hundreds of thousands of sensitive bank transfer documents in India, revealing account numbers, transaction figures, and individuals’ contact details. Researchers at cybersecurity firm UpGuard discovered in late August a publicly accessible Amazon-hosted storage server containing 273,000 PDF documents relating to bank transfers of Indian customers. The exposed files contained completed transaction forms intended for processing via the National Automated Clearing House, or NACH, a [centralized system](https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/nach/product-overview) used by banks in India to facilitate high-volume recurring transactions, such as salaries, loan repayments, and utility payments. The data was linked to at least 38 different banks and financial institutions, the researchers told TechCrunch. The spilling data was eventually plugged, but the researchers said they could not identify the source of the leak. Following the publication of this article, Indian fintech company Nupay reached out to TechCrunch by email to confirm that it “addressed a configuration gap in an Amazon S3 storage bucket” that contained the bank transfer forms. It’s not clear why the data was left publicly exposed and accessible to the internet, though security lapses of this nature are not uncommon due to human error. ## Data secured, Nupay blames ‘configuration gap’ In [its blog post](https://www.upguard.com/breaches/india-bank-transfers-data-leak) detailing its findings, the UpGuard researchers said that out of a sample of 55,000 documents that they looked at, more than half of the files mentioned the name of Indian lender [Aye Finance](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/12/british-international-investment-aye-finance-funding/), which had [filed for a $171 million IPO](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/aye-finance-ipo/) last year. The Indian state-owned State Bank of India was the next institution to appear by frequency in the sample documents, according to the researchers. After discovering the exposed data, UpGuard’s researchers notified Aye Finance through its corporate, customer care, and grievance redressal email addresses. The researchers also alerted the National Payments Corporation of India, or NPCI, the government body responsible for managing NACH. By early September, the researchers said the data was still exposed and that thousands of files were being added to the exposed server daily. UpGuard said it then alerted India’s computer emergency response team, CERT-In. The exposed data was secured shortly after, the researchers told TechCrunch. Despite this, it remained unclear who was responsible for the security lapse. Spokespeople for Aye Finance and NCPI denied that they were the source of the data spill, and a spokesperson for the State Bank of India acknowledged our outreach but did not provide comment. Following publication, Nupay confirmed that it was the cause of the data spill.Nupay’s co-founder and chief operating officer, Neeraj Singh, told TechCrunch that a “limited set of test records with basic customer details” was stored in the Amazon S3 bucket and claimed “a majority were dummy or test files.” The company said its Amazon-hosted logs “confirmed that there has been no unauthorized access, data leakage, misuse, or financial impact.” UpGuard disputed Nupay’s claims, telling TechCrunch that only a few hundred of the thousands of files its researchers sampled appeared to contain test data or had Nupay’s name on the forms. UpGuard added that it was unclear how Nupay’s cloud logs can allegedly rule out any access to Nupay’s then-public Amazon S3 bucket, given that Nupay has not asked UpGuard for its IP addresses that were used to investigate the data exposure. UpGuard also noted that details of the Amazon bucket were not limited to its researchers, as the address of the public Amazon S3 bucket had been indexed by Grayhatwarfare, a searchable database that indexes publicly visible cloud storage. When asked by TechCrunch, Nupay’s Singh did not immediately say how long the Amazon S3 bucket was publicly accessible to the web. _First published on September 25 and updated with new information from Nupay._ Topics [cybersecurity](https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/), [data exposure](https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-exposure/), [fraud](https://techcrunch.com/tag/fraud/), [India](https://techcrunch.com/tag/india/), [Security](https://techcrunch.com/category/security/) Jagmeet Singh Reporter Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

    "full_text": "If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up...",

On April 2, the United States announced a new set of tariffs impacting many trading partners, including a 37% tariff on Bangladesh, 30% on Pakistan and 44% on Sri Lanka. While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances. This announcement came as all three countries are engaged in International Monetary Fund programs and face economic challenges, including high debt burdens and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. ...",

Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance Washington could start imposing tariffs against a wider...
