Of these, the threat posed by Naxalism, a Maoist insurrection active in the eastern half of the country for over four decades, is the most overlooked and analytically neglected in Western academic and security circles. In the past seven years, Naxalite activity has grown in scope, breadth, and violence, in a “Red Corridor” stretching from Nepal to Tamil Nadu, and killed or displaced tens of thousands of people. By 2006, the problem was so severe that India’s Prime Minister characterized the insurgency as the greatest internal security threat ever faced by his country. Given India’s bloody history with separatist and communal violence, such a pronouncement is truly startling. This thesis undertakes an historical analysis of the Naxalite movement to assess how great a danger its current iteration truly poses, and what the implications might be for India’s continued rise. Soberingly, it finds that the insurgency is indeed stronger and more dangerous today than at any time in the past. Furthermore, while it does not pose an existential threat to the state in the same way as its counterpart in Nepal, it will prove extremely disruptive to India’s further growth and development if not swiftly and effectively countered. New Delhi’s efforts in this regard are so far unimpressive, but it is not too late to act. The United States has a vested interest in the emergence of a strong and stable India, and may be able to help its new “strategic partner” address the challenge of Naxalism’s resurgence.

PURPOSE “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problem of Naxalism is the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”1 With this startling pronouncement in April 2006, India’s Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, finally drew the West’s attention to an insurgency that had plagued his country for more than four decades, taking nearly 20,000 lives in the process.2 While the world was fixated on the violence in Kashmir, fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and intermittent bouts of Hindu\u0002Muslim sectarian violence, an archaic Maoist ideology, rejected even in the land of its birth, was growing in scope, breadth, and violence. Over the past seven years in particular, Naxalite rebels have come to control large swathes of the Indian countryside in a “Red Corridor” stretching from Nepal to Tamil Nadu and killed thousands of Indian security forces and civilians. This thesis will examine the evolution of the Naxalite threat, from its humble beginnings in 1967 to the present, to ascertain the true danger posed to India’s rise as a twenty-first century Asian power. B. IMPORTANCE Since the end of the Cold War and economic reforms in the early 1990s, India’s performance has been truly staggering. It would be difficult to overstate the key role the country is expected to assume in the global community over the coming decades. With a population of over 1.2 billion, a young, growing, and increasingly educated workforce, and persistent real GDP growth rates in the area of 8 percent over the last decade, India is emerging as a powerful driver of the world economy.3 Its demographic clout and 1 Manmohan Singh, “Prime Minister’s Speech to the 2nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of Chief Ministers on Naxalism,” (speech, New Delhi, India, April 13, 2006), Government of India Press Information Bureau, http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=17128 (accessed August 10, 2007). 2 Jane’s Information Group, “India’s Mosaic of Conflict,” Jane’s Terrorism and Security Monitor, July 14, 2004, http://www8.janes.com/ (accessed August 7, 2007). 3 Ibid. 2 political ambitions are also thrusting it increasingly into positions of international leadership, as the debate on its accession to permanent membership on the UN Security Council attests. If the twenty-first century is truly to be the “Asian Century,” India, along with China, will likely be leading the way. Since the late 1990s, India has also emerged as an increasingly important strategic partner to the United States. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, India was one of the first countries in Asia to extend its support in the Global War on Terror, offering refueling rights to U.S. ships and aircraft on their way toward Afghanistan. The strategic partnership has grown since then, most famously with the 10-year defense accord signed in 2005 and the U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation agreement of 2006.4 The United States has been assiduously cultivating a closer relationship with New Delhi, and greater military and strategic ties between the two countries are clearly important components of future U.S. foreign policy in Asia. However, India’s effectiveness as a world leader and U.S. strategic partner is contingent upon its continued internal stability and economic development. If Naxalism is as great a threat as many believe, its continuing spread will have serious negative repercussions on both fronts, to the detriment of India, the United States, and the larger world. A comprehensive examination and analysis of the phenomenon, and its potential to derail India’s development, is therefore both timely and important. C. LITERATURE REVIEW The Naxalist movement emerged in 1967 as an uprising of disaffected and disenfranchised peasants in Naxalbari, West Bengal. Given its four decade long existence, there is generally a surprising dearth of academic study on the movement. Western scholarship on insurgency in South Asia usually focuses on the conflict in Kashmir and (perhaps surprisingly) the plethora of smaller insurrections in India’s 4 Jane’s Information Group, “Sentinel Security Assessment - South Asia: India, External Affairs,” Jane’s Military and Security Assessments, April 26, 2007, http://www8.janes.com (accessed August 6, 2007). 3 Northeast.5 What little attention is paid to Naxalism is focused almost solely on the underlying causes of insurgent movements in general, treating Naxalism simply as one case in a larger group. Nevertheless, these treatments do provide valuable insight on contributing factors to the movement’s rise and persistence. There seem to be two main schools of thought on this issue. The first is that insurgencies arise out of unmet political demands, usually from a minority that feels it is being oppressed.6 The second school of thought cites economic inequality as a reason for insurgent uprising, typified by the revolts of lower class social groups against what they feel is lack of access to economic gain.7 A third, smaller body of literature stresses the importance of contributing factors, asserting that uprisings are more likely to occur where the terrain provides sanctuary to small groups that can train, equip, and educate their followers outside the reach of government forces.8 In the case of Naxalism, elements of all three theories seem to be at play, and are echoed in the literature from outside the West. Unsurprisingly, the study of the Naxalite movement is more extensive in India itself. Here, however, the problem seems to be not so much a lack of analysis, but the questionable objectivity, quality, and relevance of much of the scholarship. A few works on the early phases of Naxalite activity are extant, but many of these are biased to varying degrees, written by the movement’s sympathizers or even the Maoist revolutionaries themselves.9 Of somewhat greater objectivity are a handful of histories authored by journalists, but their scope, too, is limited to the earliest years of Naxalite 5 Lawrence E.

With respect to more recent analysis, there appears to be relatively little peer- reviewed research on the subject. In its place is a fairly large volume of study, of varying quality, from numerous interested parties and private organizations. While this situation presents a unique opportunity for original research, it also poses the challenge of separating objective, factual analysis from more biased or skewed reporting. Within this latter body of more recent literature, the vast majority of debate focuses on the causes of the current phase of Naxalite insurgency and speculation as to the most effective ways to deal with it. Broadly speaking, two groups with competing viewpoints emerge from all this contention. The first, or “law and order” camp, considers the Naxalite problem primarily a security issue. The main proponents of this point of view are security analysts and researchers like K.P.S. Gill and Ajai Sahni, many of them associated with India-based think tanks like the Institute for Conflict Management.11 While acknowledging socio-economic marginalization as a contributing factor, they view the lack of effective state and municipal policing, poor coordination of security efforts with New Delhi, and lenient policies toward Naxalite groups as the root causes of the insurgency. Citing numerous failed efforts at peace talks with what they view as an intransigent, nihilistic enemy, this group advocates strongly for the active suppression of Naxalism by force, with increased utilization of central government forces if necessary.12 10 For examples, see: Sankar Ghosh, The Naxalite Movement: A Maoist Experiment (Calcutta: Firma K.L. Mukhopadhyay, 1974); Sohail Jawaid, The Naxalite Movement in India: Origin and Failure of the Maoist Revolutionary Strategy in West Bengal 1967-1971 (New Delhi: Associated Publishing House, 1979). 11 The Institute for Conflict Management, “An Introduction,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/icm/index.html (accessed July 19, 2007). 12 Much of the literature generated by these analysts is published on the ‘South Asia Terrorism Portal.’ Organized by K.P.S. Gill, the controversial ‘supercop’ who crushed the Sikh insurgency in Punjab in the early 1990s, the SATP is a comprehensive resource for writings and analysis on terrorism and related security issues in South Asia. In particular, see: K.P.S. Gill, “Imperatives of Justice,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, April 30, 2005, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/07june25pio.htm (accessed July 20, 2007); K.P.S. Gill, “Blood Sweat and Anger,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, July 13, 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/06dailynewsjuly13.htm (accessed July 20, 2007); Ajai Sahni, “The Angry Men of Mao,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, February 4, 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/ajaisahni/dailynews&analysis13022007.htm (accessed July 20, 2007). 5 In contrast, the “development” camp views Naxalism as fundamentally the result of poverty and political disenfranchisement. Represented by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and the Asian Center for Human Rights, and think tanks such as the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, this camp takes a far more holistic attitude toward the most desirable means of combating Naxal violence.13 Stressing the need for poverty reduction, land reform, and better local governance, adherents to this line of reasoning reject government sponsored violence as a solution to the Naxalite problem except in the most extreme circumstances.14 As P. V. Ramana puts it, “If the military option were effective, then the problem should not have resurfaced after the initial Naxalbari uprising was suppressed.”15 Indeed, this group views overly aggressive action on the part of security forces as one of the contributing causes of further radicalization in the countryside. At first blush, the position of Ramana and his cohorts strikes one as an oversimplification of an extremely nuanced security situation. How, for example, is development aid supposed to be distributed if the people in the process of doing so are consistently under the threat of Naxalite attack? The same can be said, however, of the “law and order” argument, and its rather singular emphasis on the use of force to quell an insurgency that doubtless draws much support from the disaffection of the rural poor. Analysis of many prior guerrilla conflicts has certainly drawn attention to the need for addressing the underlying causes of rural discontent in order to draw support away from 13 For examples, see: Asian Centre for Human Rights, “Naxal Conflict in 2006,” Asian Centre for Human Rights Report, http://pdfdownload.bofd.net/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.achrweb.org%2Freports%2Findia% 2FAR07%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Freports%2Findia%2Fnaxal0107.pdf (accessed August 6, 2007); Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, “Left Extremism in India: Naxal Movement in Chattisgarh & Orissa,” Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Special Report 25, June 2006; http://pdftohtml.ganjalinux.org/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipcs.org%2FIPCS-Special\u0002Report-25.pdf (accessed August 6, 2007). 14 Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, “Naxalism and Internal Security in India,” Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Seminar, August 4, 2007, http://www.ipcs.org/newIpcsSeminars2.jsp?action=showView&kValue=2362 (accessed August 6, 2007). 15 Ibid. 6 the insurgent base.16 Additionally, neither group adequately examines the efficacy of previous governmental policies and responses, a rather glaring oversight if one hopes to prescribe a current course of action. Compounding the debate is disagreement on the nature of the threat currently posed by the insurgency. The “law and order” crowd focuses almost exclusively on the movement’s implications for political stability in India, but their analysis tends to be a bit shrill.17 While there has certainly been a greater level of political instability in the regions affected by Naxalism, it has tended to remain in the country’s remote rural areas. Their assertions that the ‘Red Menace’ threatens to split India in two and seriously undermine central authority seems hyperbolic, especially given the fact that the movement draws on, at the most, 10,000 - 20,000 hard-core cadres.18 The “development camp,” by contrast, tends to view the Naxalist threat primarily in terms of its humanitarian dimension. These analysts focus on the recent internal displacement of tens of thousands of rural and tribal peoples, and the atrocities committed by both Maoist rebels and the government security forces, as the insurgency’s greatest dangers.19 While this argument is emotionally compelling, it is by no means clear that this aspect of the threat represents a serious strategic problem for New Delhi in and of itself. India’s population is enormous, and the small percentage directly affected account for only marginal contributions to overall GDP.20 What seem to be greater threats are the larger economic implications of the Naxalite insurgency in the context of India’s growth and development, and its potential for further spread as the social impacts of globalization are felt throughout the country. 16 For an excellent example of this argument, see Jeffrey Race, War Comes to Long An: Revolutionary Conflict in a Vietnamese Province (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1972). 17 Ajai Sahni, “Left Wing Extremism in India: Evolving Strategies for Containment,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, October 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/ajaisahni/crpfdelhi.htm (accessed August 6, 2007). 18 Reuters, “Indian Maoist Violence,” Reuters AlertNet, June 27, 2007, http://www.alertnet.org/printable.htm?URL=/db/crisisprofiles/IN_MAO.htm (accessed August 6, 2007). 19 See the aforementioned Asian Center for Human Rights Report, “Naxal Conflict in 2006” and Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Seminar, “Naxalism and Internal Security in India.” 20 Ibid. 7 As The Economist recently noted, the five states most affected by insurgent violence account for significant mineral deposits and a majority of the nation’s energy resources.21 Also, while Naxalist expansion into the Western and Southern Deccan has received some scrutiny, no serious attention is being given to its possible spread into India’s wild Northeastern states. On initial inspection, the political stability, development level, and demography of this region appear eerily similar to those areas already afflicted by Naxalite violence.22 The fact that the Northeast also contains significant fossil fuel deposits only adds to the threat of the Maoists gaining a foothold.23 Clearly, any worthwhile examination of the dangers posed by Naxalism must take into account the changing nature of the social and economic contexts within which it operates. The analytical oversights and divergences of opinion discussed above are also reflected within the administration in New Delhi, where contradictory statements, confusion, and inconsistent policymaking characterize governmental responses to the most recent Maoist threat.24 As might be expected, these efforts have proven less than effective in countering the Naxalite problem, or even checking its growth in recent years. This manifest intellectual incoherence on the part of leaders, analysts, and policymakers has many causes, but is mainly due to a lack of perspective on the nature of the challenge confronting them. In an examination of the literature on this subject, from all the various points of view, the most striking feature is the absence of any comprehensive historical analysis of the Naxalite movement, the evolution of its organization, aims, and leadership, or how India’s own political, economic, and social development has contributed to (or ameliorated) the virulence of the movement. Given the relatively long lifespan of this 21 Economist, “India’s Politics,” Economist Intelligence Unit ViewsWire, March 19, 2007, http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8875555 (accessed August 7, 2007). 22 Cline, 126-149. 23 Jane’s Information Group, “Sentinel Security Assessment - South Asia: India, Natural Resources,” Jane’s Military and Security Assessments, April 27, 2005, http://www8.janes.com (accessed August 6, 2007). 24 P.V. Ramana, “Dealing With Naxalism: Shotgun Approach,” Observer Research Foundation, January 17, 2007, http://www.observerindia.com/cms/sites/orfonline/modules/analysis/AnalysisDetail.html?cmaid=5560&m macmaid=5561 (accessed August 6, 2007). 8 insurgency, it seems unlikely that a full understanding of Naxalism, or a true appreciation of its threats, can be gleaned solely by analyzing its most current iteration. With the recent spread of Naxalite activity and the notable concern it has elicited from high levels of the Indian government, this lack of an objective, realistic, and comprehensive examination represents a significant gap in the existing literature on the subject. This thesis will aim to fill that gap. D. METHODOLOGY AND SOURCES This thesis will use the comparative case study method to analyze the evolution of the Naxalite movement and assess the danger posed by the most recent upsurge in Naxalite activity. To draw an important distinction, it will not directly address the veracity of Prime Minister Singh’s assertion that “Naxalism is the single greatest internal security challenge ever faced” by his country. Given the plethora of insurgencies and violent communal movements still active in India, such an assessment would provide enough material for several lengthy theses. Instead, the central question posed here is whether the Naxalite movement currently represents a qualitatively different, and more dangerous, challenge to Indian political stability and development than it has in the past. As mentioned previously, the Naxalite insurgency is not a new phenomenon in India, and has been a thorn in the side of the country for over four decades. Generally speaking, its history can be broken down into three distinct periods, most easily distinguished by their level of insurgent activity and violence. The first period runs from the movement’s beginning in 1967 to its temporary suppression in 1972. This era encompassed the initial organization of the Naxalite movement and the rather rapid spread from its birthplace in West Bengal to a number of other states, notably Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. The second period, from 1972 until about 1991, was notable for the ideological and physical fragmentation of the movement, and its mostly localized activity in pockets of rural India. The third period (perhaps not coincidentally contemporaneous with India’s economic reforms) runs from 1991 to the present, and is distinguished by a process of gradual consolidation, culminating in the merger of the two most powerful insurgent groups (Maoist Communist Center and the 9 People’s War Group) in late 2004.25 The years since 2000 have witnessed the most dramatic escalation in the scope, breadth, and intensity of Naxalite violence. These three periods of activity will comprise the individual cases under investigation. To assess the nature and danger of the insurgency in each era, we will examine how variations in three independent variables (the socio-economic and political milieux, internal characteristics of the Naxalite movement, and governmental response) affected the dependent variable, the overall level of threat posed by the movement. These three cases will then be compared to determine whether or not the Naxalite movement indeed represents a greater danger to India than it has in the past, what specifically that danger is, and how it is likely to develop in the future. Finally, I will explore the implications for India’s continued rise and its prospects as a strategic partner of the United States. Primary and secondary source materials are utilized to the maximum extent practical. Primary sources consist largely of internal documents from the Government of India and Naxalite organizations, as well as quotes and speeches from government and insurgent leaders. As mentioned in the literature review, there is not as much rigorous academic source material on this issue as one might like. What peer-reviewed work there is receives primacy of place, but publications and studies from interested NGOs, think tanks, and security analysts also contain valuable information, and are included in this study. Finally, significant tertiary source material, in the form of coverage from reputable news media like The Economist, Frontline (an Indian weekly), and the Times of India, is required to fill factual gaps in the existing literature. E. TERMINOLOGY ISSUES For the purposes of this thesis, the generic term Maoist will refer to the Indian variety and be used interchangeably with Naxalite. Obviously, Maoist movements and organizations exist in many forms throughout the world and there are a number of others active in South Asia, most famously in Nepal. Other than a shared political ideology and 25 P.V. Ramana, “The Maoist Movement in India,” Defense and Security Analysis 22, no. 4 (December 2006): 435-449. 10 sympathy with each other’s causes, these groups remain separate and distinct entities, and care should be taken not confuse or conflate Naxalism with other Maoist movements more generally. When referring to Maoist organizations other than the Naxalites, the full name and country of origin are provided to avoid ambiguity. 11 II. THE ORGANIZATIONAL PERIOD (1967–1972) A. INTRODUCTION To inform an assessment of the relative threat posed by the current Naxalite insurgency, this chapter will undertake an historical analysis of the movement’s organization and initial activity in the period from 1967 to 1972. This era encompasses the birth of Naxalism and its fairly rapid rise as a force on the Indian political scene, and therefore presents a potentially illuminating parallel to the resurgence of violent Maoism in recent years. It also witnessed the movement’s initial failure, and so may contain useful lessons for countering the modern threat. To begin, a brief look at the history of Indian communism is in order. For the world’s largest democracy, India has a surprisingly long and complicated relationship with Marxist ideology. First emerging in 1920, in the fires of the Indian independence movement, it has grown into a major force on the sub-continent’s political scene. While all of its proponents adhere to the ultimate goal of building a utopian classless society, they have not always agreed on the most desirable method of achieving it. Nevertheless, whether motivating an underground subversive element or an aboveground, election-contesting political party, the basic ideology has proven remarkably resilient in the Indian context. Any examination of the birth of the Naxalite movement in the latter half of the 1960s requires an understanding of its development within this larger phenomenon. Jawaid Sohail, an Indian academic studying the origins of the Naxalites, divides the evolution of the Indian communist movement into six broad periods.26 From its birth until 1941, the Communist Party of India (CPI) suffered from poor organization and leadership. Outlawed by the British colonial authorities, it languished in relative obscurity. However, when Great Britain formed an alliance with the Soviet Union following the outbreak of World War II, the communists enjoyed a new legitimacy, 26 Jawaid, 4. 12 which they exploited by allying themselves with the popular Indian National Congress from 1941-1945. After World War II, this alliance foundered on the emerging international split between East and West, and the CPI moved into opposition against the growing power of Congress in New Delhi. Around the time of India’s independence in 1947, a struggle erupted between the peasants and their ruler in the princely state of Hyderabad, which was vacillating on accession to the Indian union. Inspired by the contemporaneous example of Mao’s “People’s Revolution” in China (and encouraged by its ideological benefactor, the Soviet Union), the CPI embarked on the fourth phase of its activity, supporting an armed agrarian uprising against feudal oppression in Hyderabad that became known as the Telangana movement. In 1948, when the Indian armed forces moved in to forcibly annex the Hyderabad principality, the Telangana insurgents turned against New Delhi. While this initial struggle achieved some degree of early success, temporarily “liberating” more than 3,000 villages and 16,000 square miles of territory, a confluence of events resulted in its ultimate demise. The strength of the Indian armed forces eventually proved overpowering, and a large number of the rebels were killed. Additionally, in an attempt to curry favor with India, the Soviet Union (which had encouraged the uprising in its earlier days) summarily withdrew its support. Taking the hint, the CPI dutifully followed suit in 1951.27 The failure of Telangana inaugurated the fifth period of communist activity, when the CPI, again at Soviet urging, sought to contest national and state elections in a bid to bring about the peaceful imposition of communist rule through democratic conduct. For many of the CPI’s more radical cadres, however, this decision was viewed as a betrayal of the Party’s revolutionary heritage. The memories of Telangana loomed large in their ideological imaginings and a sizeable faction of the CPI began to drift toward a more Maoist interpretation of Marxism-Leninism as the 1950s progressed.28 27 Ajay Mehra, “Naxalism in India: Revolution or Terror?” Terrorism and Political Violence 12, no. 2 (2000): 40-42. 28 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 20-22. 13 This rise of factionalism within the CPI defines the last of Sohail’s six phases and would reach its zenith in the 1960s. With the growing Sino-Soviet split from 1958-1964, the ideological tensions within the CPI continued to mount. These were only exacerbated by the emerging Sino-Indian border dispute in the early 1960s, in which the CPI leadership came down firmly on the side of New Delhi. The pro-Chinese leftists within the party branded this policy as revisionism of the worst sort, and attempted to wrest control from the pro-Soviet faction. Unable to muster sufficient support, they instead broke away from the CPI in 1964 to form the Communist Party of India-Marxist, or CPI- (M).29 However, the CPI-(M) was almost immediately beset by the same kind of ideological infighting that had precipitated its formation. The relatively more restrained group that formed the party’s leadership, though still hostile to the Soviet Union, grudgingly embraced electoral politics as a means of bringing about a more or less peaceful revolution in India. Consequently, when the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War broke out, it quickly condemned Pakistan and its Chinese patron in an effort to capitalize on the wave of nationalist sentiment sweeping India. This tactic proved remarkably successful, and CPI-(M) candidates enjoyed surprising success in the 1967 elections in West Bengal, firmly entrenching the new party within the Indian political process. This proved to be too much for the more radical Maoist faction, and it was within this contentious milieu that the Naxalite movement was born.30 There were now three major communist strands within India: the CPI, the CPI- (M), and the violently radical Maoists. This last group, eventually named for the birthplace of their armed struggle in Naxalbari, West Bengal, would in due course form a third, underground organization, the Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist, or CPI- (ML). Unlike its progenitors, the CPI-(ML) was totally opposed to the electoral process and espoused violent revolution as the only legitimate means of realizing its political agenda. In short, this entailed nothing less than the complete overthrow of the existing 29 Dipak K. Gupta, “The Naxalites and the Maoist Movement in India: Birth, Demise, and Reincarnation,” Democracy and Security 3, no. 2 (May 2007): 166. 30 Jawaid, 76-78. 14 political structure, corrupted as it was by the four evils of “U.S. imperialism, Soviet social-imperialism, feudalism, and comprador-bureaucrat capital.”31 From 1967-1972, this group embarked on a campaign of political terror that caused no small amount of consternation to national and state governments, and resonated, at least initially, with many poor residents of West Bengal, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh. To understand why, one must appreciate India’s broader political, economic, and social contexts during this period. B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments The first seventeen years of India’s independence were marked by the political hegemony of the Congress Party, personified in the undisputed leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru.32 Under his charismatic influence, the fissiparous tendencies of India’s many ethnic, linguistic, religious, and social groups were kept in check, and the country emerged as a surprising beacon of political stability in South Asia. His passing in 1964, however, (and the subsequent death of his successor, Lal Bahadur Shastri, after only two years in power) left the Congress Party rudderless, and the leadership that had united India’s various groups under the mantle of nationalism was gone. Over the next few years, the INC embarked on a process of infighting that diminished its iron grip on political power and allowed alternative forces of social mobilization to pose new challenges to its authority.33 From 1966-1972, this drama played out at the national level in the struggle between Indira Gandhi and Morarji Desai for the position of Prime Minister and head of 31 Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist),” May 1970, reprinted in Sankar Ghosh, The Naxalite Movement: A Maoist Experiment, (Calcutta: Firma K. L. Mukhopadhyay, 1974), 190-199. 32 For outstanding one volume histories of India, see: John Keay, India: A History (New York: Grove Press: 2000);0 Stanley Wolpert, A New History of India: 7th Edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004). 33 Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952-2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed.

While Mrs. Gandhi emerged at the head of a coalition of Congress factions, the structure proved too unwieldy to contest the 1967 national elections as effectively as it had in the past. Beset by a number of economic and social crises (discussed below), Congress suffered its worst electoral performance in history, winning only 40% of the popular vote and barely hanging on to majority in a parliament it had previously dominated.34 With its attention again focused inwardly, factional battles quickly resumed. Following another disappointing performance in the mid-term elections of 1969, the party officially split into two competing camps: Congress (O) under Morarji Desai, and Congress (R) under Indira {later Congress (I)}.35 Though she still commanded a plurality in parliament, Mrs. Gandhi now had to rely on a coalition of leftist parties to give her a working majority, a fact that complicated her ability to respond forcefully to the growing Naxalite movement. The decline in Congress hegemony at the center was mirrored by its performance in the state elections of 1967. From a position of complete dominance in nearly all the state legislatures, the party won only 1,661 of a total 3,453 contested seats.36 Moreover, for the first time, non-Congress led coalition governments came to power in a number of states. These included West Bengal and Orissa, both of which would shortly be affected by the growing Naxalite movement. Notably, the United Democratic Front (UDF) government that formed in West Bengal contained a large and influential bloc of CPI-(M) legislators, a fact that proved important on a number of counts. As previously mentioned, the party’s successful embrace of electoral politics served to further radicalize the already restive militant faction within the CPI-(M). Additionally, while the moderate members of the CPI-(M) and the Naxalites did become bitter enemies, as we shall see, the legacy of their earlier cooperation and shared ideology would greatly complicate the state government’s efforts to effectively counter their activities. The structural shifts underway on India’s political scene thus served to facilitate the emergence and spread of Naxalism in a number of ways. The temporary decline of 34 Wolpert, 382-383. 35 Ibid., 385. 36 Ibid., 383. 16 legitimacy at the center created greater instability that allowed alternative ideologies to take root, while the rise to power of a number of leftist parties (including the Communists) provided breathing room for their more extreme ideological brethren. Concurrently, the new requirements of coalition building diverted politicians’ attention from the essential task of ensuring security in their constituencies.37 To these must be added one more consideration: the fractious nature of political activity undoubtedly complicated the policymaking process at a time when the country faced a range of serious economic problems. While these did not necessarily arise as a result of the political turmoil, the ability of the system to effectively address them was certainly curtailed. 2. Economic Developments In spite of a series of Soviet-inspired Five Year Plans from 1951-1966, India remained a predominantly rural, agrarian economy. Burdened by generally inefficient and backward agricultural methods, it was extremely prone to underproduction and food shortages, a situation exacerbated by the country’s rapidly expanding population. The lack of proper irrigation and over-dependence on the seasonal monsoon rains caused widespread famine in 1952-53, and severe (if localized) food shortages in Bihar and West Bengal from 1965 to 1967.38 Perennially reliant on foreign food aid, particularly from the United States, Indira’s government was forced to seek even greater assistance from America in 1966, which she received in the form of increased wheat shipments and over $400 million U.S. for the implementation of India’s fourth Five-Year Plan.39 The focus of this plan was, in the words of Mrs. Gandhi, to “lay the foundation for a breakthrough in agriculture in the countryside,” primarily through state subsidization for a host of agrarian technology reforms that came to be known as the Green Revolution. Indeed, the combination of expanded irrigation networks, increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, and the utilization of higher-yielding crop varietals that had become available in 1965 did improve the food situation; by the early 1970s, India 37 Rabindra Ray, The Naxalites and their Ideology (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1988), 115. 38 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 212; Wolpert, 362, 380. 39 Wolpert, 380-381. 17 was self-sufficient in grain production for the first time in its history.40 Like most revolutions, however, this one took time to develop and produced a large amount of economic dislocation. Nowhere was this more evident than in West Bengal. These new technologies, while partly government sponsored, still required a fairly significant initial capital outlay to procure and utilize to their fullest advantage. Moreover, they tended to be best employed on relatively large tracts of land so cultivators could reap economies of scale in the new methods of production. As Edward Duyker points out in his study of the predominantly agrarian Santal tribe in West Bengal, this had the effect of economically favoring large landholders over smaller farmers, widening what were already significant income disparities between the two.41 In a system that had its roots in the Zamindars of the British colonial era, most of these smaller farmers were in fact sharecroppers, forced to give up as much as 50% of their harvest in rent to their jotedars, or landlords. To make matters worse, if smaller farmers were to avail themselves of the new technology at all, they often had to take out loans from village moneylenders at exorbitant rates of interest, usually only worsening their economic situation.42 What these long-suffering peasants were most in need of was a comprehensive system of land reform and rural development. Given the strongly socialist leanings of both Nehru and his daughter, the failure of the government to effectively tackle these problems previously was an indication of the power of entrenched vested interests. To be sure, a number of initiatives had been implemented, notably the Community Development and Rural Extension Program under the auspices of the Ford Foundation, the Panchayati Raj program, and a series of land reform laws in the 1950s and 60s.43 Unfortunately, a combination of corruption, cronyism, and loopholes in the legislation prevented any of these measures from having much of an impact on the landless laborers, 40 Keay, 524. 41 Edward Duyker, Tribal Guerrillas: The Santals of West Bengal and the Naxalite Movement (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1987), 55-57; Sumanta Banerjee, India’s Simmering Revolution: The Naxalite Uprising (London: Zed Books Ltd., 1984), 9-12. 42 Jawaid, 40-41; Gupta, 163. 43 Wolpert, 363-364. 18 tribals, and small farmers they were designed to help.44 On the contrary, larger landowners and jotedars were often able to twist the new regulations in their favor, worsening the plight of many of the rural poor, particularly in West Bengal. Nor were economic hardships confined to the countryside. Like most of India, Calcutta had been suffering from economic stagnation for a number of years, and when the Indian government was forced to devalue the rupee in 1966, it had financial repercussions that hit the city hard. The resulting inflation spawned an industrial recession in 1966-67, causing unemployment to increase to dangerous proportions, particularly among the educated youth. While precise figures for this period are unavailable, anecdotal evidence suggests that from one third to one half of all the unemployed were aged 16-24.45 With so much economic frustration in the cities and the countryside, it is not surprising that incidents of social unrest increased as well. 3. Social Developments Given the feudal socio-economic nature of much of its history, peasant uprisings in India were not uncommon. From 1783 to 1900 alone, at the height of the British Raj, over 100 such incidents affected the region to greater or lesser degrees, many of them in the perennially restive province of Bengal.46 As the Telangana uprising in the late 1940s showed, post-independence Indian society was no less susceptible to their occurrence. In retrospect, it appears obvious that many of the factors that had precipitated these events in the past were present in the latter half of the 1960s. As the living situation deteriorated for a substantial number of India’s peasants, strikes and food riots became increasingly frequent in the later 1960s.47 By 1967, many Bengali newspapers carried accounts of impoverished rural citizens driven to suicide by their dire economic straits.48 While the 44 Banerjee, 7-9. 45 Ibid., 32. 46 Mehra, 39. 47 Wolpert, 382. 48 Banerjee, 1. 19 authenticity of all these accounts is difficult to establish, they were emblematic of the desperation and discontent of a large segment of the Indian countryside. The situation in urban society was showing signs of similar strain. Disease, overcrowding, and a lack of adequate infrastructure had long been endemic to most of India’s major cities. Now, as a result of the chronic unemployment discussed in the previous section, increasing numbers of young people were also turning to petty criminality and other anti-social behavior. Known as the “lumpen-proletariat” in Marxist circles, the activities of these idle and angry youth served to further destabilize an already fragile social situation.49 Compounding this tendency was the wave of student radicalism sweeping the world in the latter 1960s. Anti-establishment rhetoric and leftist activism were common on university campuses throughout India, but especially prevalent in Calcutta. In 1965, the Communist faction captured the leadership of the student’s union at the prestigious Presidency College and embarked on a campaign of disobedience, strikes, and protests, many of them violent.50 As clashes between police and urban youths worsened over the ensuing years, Calcutta’s student population grew more radicalized. Watching these developments from their safe houses, the leaders of the Maoist faction in the CPI-(M) grew more confident by the day. The contradictions inherent in India’s “semi-feudal and semi-colonial” society, it seemed to them, were reaching their breaking point, and the situation was ripe for the masses to rise up and finally deliver India from its centuries of capitalist domination. To ignite this potent mixture of urban and rural unrest, all that was needed was a spark. 49 Banerjee, 33. 50 Ibid., 50-52. 20 C. INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NAXALITE INSURGENCY 1. Organization and Leadership Two men in particular laid the groundwork for Naxalism’s emergence in 1967. Kanu Sanyal, a long-time CPI-(M) organizer active among the Santal tribals in Darjeeling, was among those within the party who disagreed strongly with its newly conciliatory leanings toward New Delhi and electoral politics. He discovered an ideological mentor in a passionate but lesser known party functionary, Charu Mazumdar.51 Mazumdar, born to a high caste family in Darjeeling district in 1918, had joined the Communist movement as a young man while attending university, and remained active in the CPI and CPI-(M) for most of his adult life. By the mid-1960s, he had wholeheartedly embraced Maoism as the only valid form of Communist struggle for the Indian situation. Adhering to Mao’s dictum that “political power grows from the barrel of a gun,” Mazumdar utterly rejected electoral politics and sought to apply the lessons of the Chinese revolution, as he saw them, to the struggle in his own country.52 In this, he was greatly influenced by the writings of Lin Biao, the Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and his strategic formulations for guerrilla warfare.53 Mazumdar laid out his theories in a series of essays penned between 1965 and 1967 that served as something of a manifesto for his more radical comrades, particularly in West Bengal.54 In those two years, elements of the CPI-(M) started veering on a more overtly militant course. Under the guidance of Sanyal and Mazumdar, on March 3, 1967, an uprising of poor tribals and peasants erupted in the village of Naxalbari, in the Siliguri sub-division of Darjeeling. While initially confined to the seizure of land and food-grains hoarded by the jotedars, it soon turned violent and began spreading to other villages in Siliguri. By 51 Prakash Singh, The Naxalite Movement in India (New Delhi: Rupa & Co., 2006), 268-274. 52 Jawaid, 55. 53 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 126-127. 54 Biplab Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” Social Scientist 6, no. 12 (July 1978): 8- 10. 21 July 5, the movement had grown large enough to attract the attention of its ideological progenitor, the Communist Party of China (CPC), which, in an editorial in Beijing’s People’s Daily, lauded it as “a peal of spring thunder [that] has crashed over the land of India,” and “a development of tremendous significance for the Indian people’s revolutionary struggle.”55 In reality, the rebellion was not quite that momentous at this stage, as the ease with which it was put down by the West Bengal government would attest. In late July, increased police action and a near total lack of coordination within the movement began to take their toll, and the initial uprising disintegrated by September.56 Nevertheless, the fire had been lit. Mazumdar emerged as a revolutionary leader and his ideology attracted an increasing number of adherents. Now known as Naxalites, militant groups inspired by Mazumdar’s theories began appearing throughout India. Emboldened by China’s rhetorical support, Mazumdar and these like-minded radicals officially broke from the CPI-(M). In November 1967, the All India Coordination Committee of Revolutionaries (AICCR, later renamed the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries, AICCCR) was formed in an attempt to gather the various strands of Naxalism under the banner of one revolutionary party.57 Though largely successful, the deliberations in this body revealed a number of ideological differences among the groups that would prove extremely divisive in a few years. In two cases, that of the Andhra faction of the AICCCR led by Nagi Reddy and another group known as Dakshin Desh, the differences proved insurmountable at an early stage, resulting in their exclusion from the nascent organization. Nevertheless, in April 1969, the formation of the CPI-(ML), with Mazumdar at the head, was announced in Calcutta and quickly endorsed by the CPC.58 It had an estimated 17,000 members at its founding, the majority in Andhra 55 People’s Daily, “ Spring Thunder Breaks Over India,” July 5, 1967, reprinted in Prakash Singh, 259-264. While China did offer significant rhetorical support to the Naxalite movement early on, particularly through editorials in the People’s Daily and broadcasts on the government controlled Xinhua News Agency, there is little evidence of any more concrete assistance. . 56 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 12. 57 Ibid., 31. 58 Ibid., 33. 22 Pradesh and West Bengal.59 For the next three years, the CPI-(ML) would be the dominant face of Naxalism in India. With the pronouncement that the “Chinese Chairman is our Chairman, the Chinese path is our path,” Mazumdar’s agenda for the Naxalites was codified at the First Party Congress in May 1970. It explicitly called for a Maoist inspired violent overthrow of the Indian government by establishing liberated bases in the countryside, surrounding the cities, and eventually subsuming all of India within its “people’s democratic revolution.”60 While Mazumdar’s heady optimism may be understandable in the international political context of the late 1960s, the techniques he advocated for accomplishing these objectives were questionable, to say the least. 2. Strategy and Tactics Mazumdar’s strategy was predicated on the assumption that the contradiction between feudalism and the masses of India’s rural poor had reached the breaking point.61 In his estimation, the situation was ripe for a spontaneous uprising of the beleaguered peasants that would sweep the old political order from the scene in a few short years. In a 1968 article in Liberation, the Naxalites’ primary propaganda mouthpiece, Mazumdar opined that the People’s Liberation Army would be marching through the countryside “by the beginning of 1971, if not in 1970.”62 This outlook informed his strategic formulations in a number of ways. The first was an emphasis on the rural peasants as the true base of the revolution.63 The focus of revolutionary activity was squarely on the countryside, with urban agitation initially prohibited. However, with the majority of the rural population illiterate, Mazumdar was forced to rely on educated ideologues to form the ground level leadership of his organization. To this end, he encouraged the recruitment and 59 Rabindra Ray, 108. 60 “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist),” May 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 199; Jawaid, 36. 61 Ibid.,194. 62 Charu Mazumdar, writing in Liberation, Nov 1968, as reported in Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 62. 63 “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist,” May 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 194. 23 participation of educated urban youth, but demanded they leave the cities and adopt the ways of the local villagers to better indoctrinate and lead them in their revolutionary struggle.64 While a large number of radicalized college students (especially from Calcutta) heeded this call, their insinuation into rural society was highly problematic. Most were quite incapable of adapting to village life, and their different customs engendered suspicion from the more parochial tribals and farmers.65 As a result, while peasants were often capable of being motivated for local actions, they generally failed to adopt Naxalism’s broader ideology.66 As Dipak Gupta notes, the vast majority of activist cadres were educated and from upper caste Hindu families, with poor, illiterate peasants accounting for less than 20% of the committed membership.67 One reason for this apathy among the peasants may have been the Naxalites’ renunciation of mass movements, the second pillar of Mazumdar’s strategy. In his estimation, since the country was on the verge of a spontaneous revolution, it needed no organizing force to guide it. Indeed, mass organizations could only hurt the movement, as they would give the enemy a focus for retaliation.68 While the formation of the CPI- (ML) may seem to contradict this outlook, in reality, the party functioned more symbolically than as a classical political or military organization. While Mazumdar’s ideology did reign supreme, operational control was actually quite decentralized, with village and district level organizations enjoying almost complete autonomy. This situation utterly precluded the development of any sort of broader economic or social agenda that might have been useful in attracting greater peasant support. In fact, Mazumdar believed that attention devoted to social or economic programs could only detract from the primary goal of seizing political power from the state, and actively discouraged their formulation.69 64 Ghosh, 109. 65 Gupta, 173-174; Jawaid, 95. 66 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 57-59. 67 Gupta, 171. 68 Ghosh, 101. 69 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 58-59. 24 Rather than offering hope, Mazumdar contended that the way to inspire India’s poor was to offer the opportunity for revenge. This accounted for the third pillar of his overall strategy, which he dubbed the “annihilation of class enemies.”70 As the name suggests, this entailed the deliberately brutal murder of jotedars, moneylenders, and agents of the government in an effort to spread “red terror” throughout the countryside.71 With the injunction that “he who has not dipped his hand in the blood of class enemies can hardly be called a communist,” the implementation of this campaign became the primary goal of Naxalite cadres throughout India.72 While it did succeed in driving off the landowning elite in some of the affected areas, the sadistic nature of the killings eventually alienated many more of the peasants than it inspired.73 The tactics that Mazumdar prescribed for the execution of the annihilation strategy were similarly self-defeating. Believing that an obsession with the acquisition of firearms would only distract the peasants from their spontaneous revolutionary zeal, he initially forbade their use by any but the party’s leadership, and even these he limited to purposes of self-defense. In the application of the terror campaign, the cadres were only permitted to use traditional weapons like spears, sickles, and bows and arrows. His emphasis on decentralization also stressed the primacy of village level squads, usually of no more than seven members, at the expense of larger formations of fighters.74 Though he later paid lip service to the need for organizing a ‘People’s Liberation Army’ along more conventional lines, there was never any serious attempt to form such a force.75 These tactical decisions left the Naxalites at a decided disadvantage against the comparatively well armed and organized government security forces that eventually moved in to counter them. 70 Charu Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” Liberation, February 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 290-297. 71 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 45-46. 72 Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” reprinted in Ghosh, 294. 73 Dasgupta. The Naxalite Movement, 58, 64. 74 Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” reprinted in Ghosh, 291. 75 Banerjee, 204-206. 25 For all their operational errors, however, a temporarily accommodating political climate allowed the Naxalites to embark on a series of campaigns that caused no small amount of instability in the regions they affected. From the formation of the party in 1969 until July of 1971, they were a force to be reckoned with in a number of Indian states. 3. Naxalite Activity While Naxalite activity and violence in this period were reported from as far afield as Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, the Punjab, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, the bulk remained confined to West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.76 It was in these two states that the annihilation program was most effectively implemented and where the Naxalites had their greatest political impact. Perhaps surprisingly, the first large-scale campaign after Naxalbari came not in West Bengal, but in Srikakulum district of Andhra Pradesh. Srikakulum’s history of peasant unrest predated the Naxalites, emerging as early as 1961 in the form of agitation by the native Girijan tribals against the economic oppression of the landholding class. While this was usually relatively peaceful, the example and influence of Naxalbari soon turned it violent. By late 1968, under the leadership of a number of imported Naxalite cadres, the Girijans were becoming increasingly militant. In 1969, they embarked on a classic annihilation campaign for political control, killing more than 150 people and eventually extending their writ over more than 500 square miles. While Mazumdar’s hopes were high for this “liberated area,” the movement proved more fragile than it appeared. Coordinated action by the security forces resulted in the deaths or arrests of top Naxalite leaders in the district, and Girijan support for the insurgency dissipated by mid-1970.77 In late 1969, the Naxalites launched another offensive in the Midnapur district of West Bengal. Like Srikakulum, it was a classic annihilation campaign with exclusively 76 Singh, 45-81. 77 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 46-52. 26 political aims. In Midnapur, however, the leadership that instigated the rebellion was not composed of older party cadres, but young students from Calcutta.78 Led by Ashit Chatterjee and Santosh Rana, the movement achieved some early success, accounting for the deaths of around 100 ‘class enemies’ and considerable economic disruption. Like Srikakulum, however, the uprising proved unsustainable and collapsed in the face of pressure from the security forces in early 1970.79 Birbhum in West Bengal, Muzzafarpur in Bihar, and the Palia district of Uttar Pradesh also witnessed organized Naxalite activity in 1969-1970. Like all the other rural uprisings, however, their early intensity masked fundamental weaknesses, and they died out almost as dramatically as they had flared up.80 Ironically, Naxalism’s last major campaign in this period occurred not in the countryside, but in Calcutta. Perhaps in desperation at the failures of its rural campaigns, the CPI-(ML) made an abrupt strategic reversal and launched a “cultural revolution” in West Bengal’s teeming capital in April 1970.81 While some observers have described this surprising development as a spontaneous movement by the urban Naxalite cadres, it is clear that Mazumdar himself guided the emergence of this new front at an early stage. Initially, the focus of the movement was on the destruction of symbols of bourgeoisie culture. These included cinemas, universities, and statues of iconic Indian figures like Mahatma Gandhi. Within a few months, however, the annihilation campaign appeared in Calcutta. Initially targeting police officers, its focus soon shifted to CPI-(M) politicians and activists, and even middle-class businessmen.82 The fact that Naxalite violence had now arrived in a major city occasioned great alarm throughout the country, not least in New Delhi. As the insurgency grew more violent through 1970 and early 1971, however, it became apparent that it was losing its ideological focus. In large part, this was due to a dramatic shift in the makeup of the party’s membership. While upper class university 78 Ghosh, 78-79; Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 57. 79 Singh, 63. 80 Ibid., 64-74. 81 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 68-77. 82 Ibid., 79-91. 27 students had been an important component of the early Naxalite movement, by 1970, most had either been arrested or dropped out in revulsion at the excesses of the annihilation campaign. In their place, shiftless youth, petty criminals, and other anti\u0002social elements had risen to prominence in the urban faction of the CPI-(ML). Under the guise of class struggle, extortion, theft, and personally motivated murders by party cadres grew increasingly common. Unsurprisingly, this did little to endear the Naxalites to the majority of Calcutta society. Already alienated by the statue smashing campaign and other petty vandalism, the public turned decisively against them in 1971.83 As a result of this string of failures, the ideological cracks in the leadership of the CPI-(ML) that had been evident at its founding widened into chasms. Mazumdar was increasingly the target of pointed criticism from other Naxalite leaders on a number of issues.84 Prominent among these were his adoption of the annihilation strategy as the primary form of struggle, his total neglect of the urban proletariat as a target of agitation, and the wisdom of his prohibition of all mass organization - in short, all the tenets of his grand strategy. To make matters worse, he had also lost the rhetorical support of the CPC. In late 1970, the Chinese government sent a message to Mazumdar echoing many of the same criticisms that were emanating from within his own party.85 Shortly thereafter, its radio broadcasts in support of the CPI-(ML) ceased.86 Though still claiming allegiance to Beijing, Mazumdar diverged from the CPC line in 1971 by vocally supporting the uprising in East Pakistan against Yahya Khan’s government. This proved to be the last straw for many other Naxalite leaders, who finally broke ranks with this betrayal of China’s ideological direction.87 With the leadership hopelessly divided, the rural campaign in tatters, and the lumpen-proletariat dominating the urban scene, the 83 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 94-102. 84 Sohail, 45-49. 85 Ghosh, 12-21. 86 Banerjee, 170. 87 Banerjee, 247-248; Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 192-193. 28 Naxalite movement was foundering badly. Nevertheless, it would take concerted action by the central and state governments to definitively put an end to this era of Naxalite activity. D. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 1. Center Responses Initially, the government in New Delhi paid scant attention to the outbreak of violence in Naxalbari. Viewing the situation primarily as a localized law and order problem, it did little more than express its opinion to West Bengal that the situation should be dealt with swiftly.88 To be fair, in spite of the attention it received as a result of the CPC’s endorsement, the early movement was too weak and disorganized to merit much more of a reaction. Even as Naxalism organized and spread through 1968-69, it still failed to elicit much of an official response. As mentioned previously, this was probably due to the distraction provided by the leadership battles and other political machinations that occupied the center during these years. By 1970, however, the situation was beginning to change. The emergence of Naxalite violence in Calcutta, one of India’s largest cities, was too worrisome a development to ignore. On August 11, 1970, Indira Gandhi pronounced that the government would fight the Naxalites with “all the strength at its command.”89 Securing the elections in early 1971 provided a pretext for the deployment of military and paramilitary forces to some of the worst Naxal-affected districts.90 In July 1971, the center launched Operation Steeplechase, a coordinated campaign by the Indian army, the Central Reserve Police Force, and local police across contiguous districts in West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa that were still affected by Naxalite violence. This area encompassed West Bengal’s Midnapur and Birbhum districts, and the cadres still active were largely holdovers from those earlier campaign. While Steeplechase was not a complete success, 88 Ghosh, 37. 89 Singh, 112. 90 Ghosh, xxii. 29 in that a sizeable number of activists escaped the police dragnet, it did achieve some noteworthy results: hundreds of Naxalites were arrested, large caches of weapons were seized, and most importantly, the rural population’s confidence in the strength of the government was restored.91 New Delhi also attempted to undercut the grass-roots appeal of Naxalism by championing a number of rural development and land reform schemes.92 The West Bengal Land Reform Act, passed in January 1970, was one such initiative. It imposed ceilings on the total acreage individual families were allowed to hold and reduced the maximum rent that landlords could charge their sharecroppers. As usual, the law was filled with loopholes, and the ever-present corruption and conflicts of interest severely curtailed its overall efficacy.93 Nevertheless, it did help some of the landless poor and scored political points at the expense of the Naxalites. For all the efforts of the central government, however, Naxal violence remained fundamentally a state problem. India’s Constitution devolved authority over internal security to the states, and it was their policies and initiatives that mattered most.94 Of course, if a state proved incapable of handling its own affairs, there was a constitutional answer for that, too. 2. State Responses In Andhra Pradesh, a determined state government, united under firm Congress Party rule, was able to cope with the violence in Srikakulum on its own. While allegations of police brutality and ‘encounter killings’ were common, the swift and effective application of force by the state police broke the back of the insurgency there in a matter of months.95 The situation in West Bengal was somewhat more complicated. With the CPI-(M) occupying key leadership positions in the United Democratic Front 91 Singh, 99-100. 92 Wolpert 389; Jawaid, 98-100. 93 Jawaid, 86-89. 94 Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Annual Report 2006-07, 1. 95 Ghosh, 84. 30 government, West Bengal’s response to the emergence of Naxalism was initially quite tepid. This was largely due to infighting between the members of the coalition. While other parties argued for a strong response to the initial outbreak of violence in Naxalbari, the CPI-(M) vacillated. Though it wanted to reign in its adventurist cadres in Siliguri, it was fearful of damaging its revolutionary credentials by authorizing too forceful a response. Additionally, the agitators were still members of the CPI-(M) at this stage, and the party was hopeful of bringing them back into its fold. As a result, police actions in response to the increasing violence through July 1967 were quite circumscribed.96 By the time a deteriorating situation forced the government’s hand in August and September, the movement had already attracted a sizeable following. While the insurrection in Naxalbari was effectively put down in a relatively short period of time, the damage had been done. Though the inability of the UDF to effectively govern forced its dissolution in November 1967, mid-term elections returned it to power in February 1969. With broadly the same makeup, it proved even less capable of agreement in policymaking, particularly with respect to the Naxalites. Not only did the government fail to outlaw the movement, some of its constituent parties actually sought to curry favor with the Maoists in a bid to strengthen their popularity with rural voters.97 Again, this resulted in a generally weak security response, with the police budget actually reduced just as the activity in Midnapur and Calcutta was beginning to heat up.98 With the coalition hopelessly polarized and the security situation deteriorating, New Delhi imposed President’s Rule on West Bengal in March 1970. President’s Rule, an administrative device under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, allows the center to assume executive authority in a state if the ruling government can no longer form a majority in the state legislature.99 With the governor 96 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 9. 97 Jawaid, 96-97. 98 Ibid., 73. 99 Government of India, Constitution of India, Ministry of Laws and Justice, http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/welcome.html (accessed December 11, 2007). 31 (as an agent of New Delhi) now firmly in charge, the security situation began to improve rapidly. The 1932 Bengal Suppression of Terrorist Outrage Act was quickly revived, giving the police expanded powers of detention.100 Funding for the state police forces more than doubled, and the number of officers rose dramatically.101 Augmented by personnel from the center’s Border Security Force, these additional men were posted to hotbeds of Naxalite activity, especially Siliguri, Midnapur, and Calcutta. In April, a joint operation by the Indian military and the Central Reserve Police Force, in coordination with state police, successfully put down the Midnapur uprising in a matter of weeks.102 Though it took a while longer, the expanded presence in Calcutta also proved effective. Aided by government sponsored volunteer militias, ironically drawn from the same lumpen-proletariat element the Naxalites had utilized, forceful policing resulted in the deaths or arrest of thousands of Naxalite cadres and sympathizers.103 As in Andhra Pradesh, abuses by the anti-Naxal forces were not uncommon – in one notorious instance, 300 armed members of a volunteer militia rampaged through a Naxalite stronghold in the Cossipore-Baranagore neighborhood of Calcutta, killing nearly 100 suspected Naxalites in cold blood.104 Though brutal, the tactics were effective. By the end of 1971, Mazumdar was forced to officially abandon the urban campaign in the face of mounting losses.105 The movement was by this time a spent force, and its fortunes continued to decline as top leadership was caught up in the tightening police dragnet through the first half of 1972. Finally, on July 16, 1972, Charu Mazumdar himself was arrested from a safe house in the Calcutta suburb of Entally. On July 28, he died in police custody at the age of 54. The death of Mazumdar was a fittingly symbolic denouement to the movement that had burned so brightly for over five years. With the departure of its spiritual and ideological leader, the first phase of Naxalite activity in India was over. 100 Jawaid, 83-84. 101 Ibid., 85. 102 Gupta, 171. 103 Jawaid, 84. 104 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 92. 105 Banerjee, 213. 32 E. CONCLUSION This chapter has analyzed the birth, rise, and eventual decline of the Naxalite insurgency from 1967-1972. The emergence of Naxalism in 1967 was ultimately attributable to a number of factors. Persistent poverty and growing inequality in the countryside produced a groundswell of discontentment in the poor rural population. Deeply frustrated with their government, some peasants and tribals were willing to entertain any alternative ideology that promised empowerment and greater equity; though it was certainly the most violent, Naxalism was just one of a number of socio-political movements that began to emerge at this time.106 Concurrently, political instability brought by the initial weakening of the INC’s hegemony provided room for these alternative ideologies to grow. Finally, leftist revolutionary rhetoric was ubiquitous in the late 1960s, both domestically and internationally. This provided a veneer of ideological sophistication to a movement that offered little more than violence, and allowed it to challenge the state’s legitimacy, at least for a while. However, while the Naxalite movement during this period drew much attention from the press and occasioned a great deal of worry in New Delhi and elsewhere, it seems clear in hindsight that the danger was not as great as many feared at the time. Although Naxalism touched almost every part of the country from 1967-1972, its activities were widely dispersed, and it never controlled more than 200 of India’s 56,000 rural villages at any one time.107 As militant Communism blossomed throughout much of the third world in the late 1960s, it may seem surprising that it failed to gain more traction in the Indian context, beset as it was by many of the same socio-economic problems evident in Southeast Asia or Latin America. In the final analysis, much of the responsibility for the ultimate failure of the Naxalite movement in this period must be laid at the feet of Charu Mazumdar. 106 Some others included movements based on language, caste, and even the rural-urban divide. For a discussion of these phenomena, see: Yadav and Palshikar, 92-96. 107 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 62. 33 The man regarded as ‘India’s Mao Zedong\" proved to be a much less competent leader than his Chinese namesake. Ideologically, his blind application of the Chinese revolutionary model to India overlooked fundamental differences between the two countries. India’s governmental apparatus was much more powerful than its Chinese counterpart had been in the late 1940s. The institution of parliamentary democracy had become well entrenched in India, and it would take more than temporary economic hardships to undermine its widespread support. Additionally, despite its faltering in the elections of 1967, the Congress Party proved to be enduringly popular. The INC was granted an impressive mandate in the 1971 and 1972 elections at both the state and national levels, demonstrating that it retained the support of a majority of the Indian population.108 Therefore, while Mazumdar correctly identified the rising levels of discontent in Indian society, he totally misread the resultant potential for a rapid revolution. The majority of India’s peasants were concerned with local social and economic issues, and remained unmoved by Naxalite political ideology. As it turned out, most of Mazumdar’s strategic and operational initiatives actually proved counterproductive in winning over India’s masses. His single-minded focus on the seizure of political power and utter contempt for mass organization precluded the development of any socio-economic agenda that might have been useful in garnering broad rural support. While this was supposed to be achieved through the application of the annihilation campaign, the brutality of this program actually alienated the majority of peasants. When it was extended to urban areas during the Calcutta campaign, it had the same effect on most city residents; the ill-conceived “cultural revolution” and the excesses of the lumpen-proletariat faction only exacerbated this revulsion. In the end, Mazumdar’s strategic choices effectively denied his movement any base of popular support. Nor did he better acquit himself in his tactical formulations. The curious prohibition on firearms left his cadres woefully outgunned by the military and police. Additionally, his penchant for decentralization severely restricted the Naxalites’ ability to 108 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 229-231; Wolpert, 389. 34 adapt to changing military circumstances. Even as the scale of the government’s security operations grew from 1967-1972, the Maoists continued to emphasize small, village-level units at the expense of a more sizeable and coherent military organization. Time and again, these proved incapable of mounting an effective resistance to the larger, better equipped, and more highly organized forces arrayed against them. While Mazumdar’s inept leadership set the stage for the movement’s demise, the overall effectiveness of the government’s response must also be acknowledged. With the exception of the UDF initiatives in West Bengal, robust and forceful responses by state and central security forces were eventually successful in putting down all the uprisings. While these did involve a number of human rights abuses, the growing public disgust with Naxalite violence meant that most Indians seemed to accept these aggressive policing methods.109 Simultaneously, all levels of government increased funding for land reforms and rural development programs in an effort to address the socio-economic inequities that had helped spark the outbreak of violence. While these did not always work as they were intended, they did succeed in winning back the support of the rural poor. The final contributor to the failure of the Naxalite movement in this period was its overall organizational weakness. Mazumdar’s charismatic personality had papered over the movement’s fissiparous tendencies in 1967, but these forces could not be contained for long. Ideological differences and powerful egos erupted again in late 1970, and the leadership had irrevocably fractured by 1972. The CPI-(ML) splintered into a number of different factions, including the Maoist Communist Centre, the Proletarian Party, and a grouping of the CPI-(ML)’s Regional Committees of West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.110 Along with Dakshin Desh and the Nagi Reddy Group, these localized, weakened, and divided organizations would be the diminished face of Naxalism through its next period of activity, 1972-1991. 109 Gupta, 173 110 Jawaid, 94. 35 III. THE FRAGMENTARY PERIOD (1972-1991) A. INTRODUCTION In 1972, the Naxalites emerged from the failures and setbacks at the end of the Organizational Period in a critically weakened state: their founder and most influential leader, Charu Mazumdar, was dead; their surviving leadership was rotting in jail after a brutally effective government crackdown; their activists were disillusioned and demoralized after a succession of defeats; and the excesses of revolutionary zeal had alienated them from the vast majority of the Indian public. Given this litany of woes, most observers could be forgiven for assuming that the movement was as good as dead. As it turned out, the flame ignited at Naxalbari had not extinguished – it was, however, reduced to a smoldering ember that was very nearly snuffed out over the course of the next two decades.111 The years from 1972-1991 unquestionably marked the nadir of the Naxalite movement in India. Battered by the government’s security forces in the previous period, it desperately needed to reunify and consolidate its position. Instead, it was repeatedly fragmented by disagreements over ideological abstractions, strategic formulations, and even personal egos. The result was a proliferation of small, localized groups that proved utterly incapable of mounting any effective challenge to the Indian government. In short, the story of the Naxalites in this period is a rather boring one compared to the events of 1965-1972. It is, nonetheless, one worth examining. For the purposes of analyzing Naxalism’s resurgence after 1991, this period is important on three counts. First, it acted as a bridge between the two periods of relatively high Naxalite activity. Secondly, it gave rise to the factions that turned into the dominant Naxalite groups of the current era; clearly, any study of these organizations must take into account the circumstances of their birth. Lastly, determining the reasons for the movement’s inability to gain traction in the past should help in prescribing effective ways to counter its spread in future. 111 This analogy is borrowed, with appreciation, from Prakash Singh’s The Naxalite Movement in India. 36 B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments The 1970s and 80s were a transitional period in Indian politics. The instability of 1965-1971, discussed in the preceding chapter, was the first indication that the institution of one-party hegemony known as the ‘Congress System’ was not as unshakeable as it had previously appeared.112 Though Indira’s party enjoyed landslide victories at the state and national levels in 1971 and 1972, successfully consolidating the INC and the country under the banner of her leadership, this apparent return to the stability of the old ‘Congress system’ belied a number of emerging structural changes in the Indian polity. Chief among these were the increasing politicization of lower and middle classes and castes, the rising importance of local-level issues, and the resultant emergence of regional and state level parties. While these processes evolved gradually, they set the stage for the tremendous changes that would occur on the Indian political scene in the 1990s, and helped make politics in these two decades more complex than it had been in the past. Though a thorough examination of these phenomena is outside the scope of this thesis, they indirectly impacted the course of Naxalism in a number of ways.113 One was through political developments in New Delhi. As previously alluded, Congress (I) emerged in 1972 with firm control of the national government. In light of the changing political scene, the party was remarkably effective in maintaining its grip on power for the remainder of this period, only relinquishing it during two brief interludes of Janata Party-led coalition government, in 1977-1980 and 1989-1991. In retrospect, this success was largely due to Indira’s political guile and capacity for heavy-handed authoritarianism. Recognizing that anti-colonial nationalism was no longer an effective rallying cry for the masses, she sought to mobilize support by turning to a more populist 112 Rajni Kothari, “The Congress ‘System’ in India,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 58-70. 113 For an excellent examination of structural changes in Indian politics during this period, see: Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952- 2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 73-113. 37 message.114 Though Congress remained the party of India’s industrial classes, it also began to reemphasize its socialist roots. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, agricultural development, poverty reduction, and economic self-sufficiency featured prominently in Congress’ platform, successfully attracting significant portions of the lower classes and castes.115 This shift in message did more than win elections – it also boosted the government’s legitimacy with India’s poor, thereby undercutting the appeal of alternative ideologies like Naxalism. When rhetoric proved insufficient in maintaining Congress hegemony, however, the party was not averse to taking more extreme measures. The imposition of the ‘Emergency’ from June 1975 to March 1977 demonstrated this most strikingly. Faced with declining popularity and a series of legal challenges to her rule, Mrs. Gandhi temporarily abrogated the constitution, suspended all civil rights, jailed opposition political figures, and instituted martial law throughout the country.116 Though democracy and the rule of law were reinstated with the national elections in 1977, Indira, and the Congress Party more generally, showed themselves more than willing to deal harshly with political opposition. As we will see, this resulted in a usually muscular response to separatist movements and other insurrections, including those of the Naxalite groups. Developments at the state level were also important. Throughout the early 1970s and the period of the Emergency, Congress governments retained power in the vast majority of the Indian states. However, after the INC’s temporary defeat at the center in 1977, the number and influence of state-level parties accelerated dramatically. Significantly, this phenomenon began in those areas most affected by Naxalism during the previous period, with the emergence of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh and the resurgence of the CPI-(M) in West Bengal.117 The growth of these parties, many of which depended on tenant farmers and landless laborers for their 114 Yadav and Palshikar, 96. 115 Wolpert, 389-410. 116 Ibid., 398-399. 117 Yadav and Palshikar, 106-112. 38 primary constituencies, gave a new political voice to groups that had been effectively disenfranchised in the past. Their inclusion in the political process helped keep rural unrest in check and brought an added impetus for meaningful action on economic issues that were dear to this large demographic. 2. Economic Developments India’s economy during this period was something of a mixed bag. At the macro level, Congress’ socialist policies, the persistence of an overbearing public sector epitomized by the ‘License Raj’ and a strategy of import-substitution industrialization introduced significant distortions in the economy that stifled growth the country so desperately needed. While overall GDP increased at an average of 3.5 percent throughout the 1970s, an exploding population meant the corresponding rate per capita was only 1.3 percent, far below that of the rest of the developing world. Though tepid attempts at liberalization resulted in slightly higher growth rates in the 1980s, their incomplete nature resulted in a balance of payments crisis that ultimately proved unsustainable and precipitated the economic reforms of the 1990s.118 On the other hand, the benefits of the Green Revolution were finally becoming more evenly distributed, and Congress’ newfound political populism translated into a slew of rural and agricultural development initiatives and aid programs.119 For the country’s poor farmers at least, the picture was finally becoming a bit brighter. Indira’s initial reforms after the 1971 elections were ambitious in scope and included land-reform legislation, rural employment programs, nationalization of food markets, and investment in transportation infrastructure designed to help farmers get their product to market. These were consolidated in the country’s Fifth Five Year Plan, launched in 1974, the explicit aims of which were the “removal of poverty” and the “attainment of economic self-reliance.” For all its optimism, the plan’s designs were complicated by the same corruption and conflicts of interest that had plagued reform efforts in previous eras. Additionally, the worldwide oil shocks of the early 1970s 118 Gurcharan Das, “The India Model,” Foreign Affairs 85, no. 4 (July/August 2006): 4-5. 119 Wolpert, 387-388; Jawaid, 100-102. 39 brought massive inflation that substantially diminished economic growth in real terms. Bihar and Gujarat erupted in riots and protests at the diminishing economic situation, and a national railroad strike threatened to bring the country to a standstill and compound its economic problems.120 Though political factors contributed more directly to the imposition of the Emergency in 1975, Indira used her newfound power to tackle the economic challenges facing the country. Her ‘Twenty-Point Program’ of economic development was very similar to the country’s Fifth Five Year Plan, but with political opposition sidelined, Mrs. Gandhi was able to force its implementation more effectively.121 For all its authoritarianism, the Program was remarkably successful in getting the economic situation under control and finally bringing some relief to farmers and the rural poor. Inflation was successfully tamed, food prices retreated to their 1971 levels, and agricultural investment and subsidies began reaching the people that truly needed them.122 When the Emergency was repealed and the Janata government came to power in 1977, the coalition proved so weak and the government so ineffectual that economic problems returned almost immediately. Inflation and unemployment skyrocketed, and Congress returned to power in 1980 with the slogan “Elect a Government that Works!”123 Though she initially tried to cut agricultural subsidies, the political backlash convinced Indira and her party that the rural interests would still have to be placated. The Sixth Five Year Plan brought numerous anti-poverty initiatives like the Integrated Rural Development Program and the National Rural Employment Program, and inaugurated huge agricultural subsidies that continued throughout the 1980s.124 In sum, while overall economic performance throughout this period was relatively mediocre, the numerous development initiatives meant the plight of the rural poor ceased to deteriorate as it had 120 Wolpert, 396-397. 121 Ibid., 400. 122 Ibid., 403. 123 Ibid., 407-410. 124 Banerjee, 293. 40 from 1965-1972. In fact, the rural poverty rate declined relatively dramatically over this period, from 56% in 1973 to only 39% by 1988.125 This is not to imply that these programs were unqualified successes; corruption and conflicts of interest continued to hamper their implementation, and their benefits were far from uniformly distributed. Nevertheless, they were successful enough to alleviate some of the income disparities that had stoked the fires of Naxalism in the previous period, and diminished economic and class issues as a source of social unrest.126 3. Social Developments Despite the attenuation of economic inequity as a source of social strife, the 1970s and ‘80s witnessed the birth of new ethnic and religious cleavages in India’s heterogeneous society, precipitating the rise of a number of new communal and secessionist movements. Though none of these were directly connected to the phenomenon of Naxalism, their emergence and the government’s response did have implications for the Maoists’ fortunes. Two of the most prominent of these movements occurred in the Punjab and India’s wild Northeast. In the late 1970s, a wave of unrest swept India’s ‘Seven Sisters,’ the small and predominantly tribal states east of the Siliguri corridor. While the trouble started in response to an influx of Bengali refugees in the wake of the 1971 Indo-Pak War, it soon took on a distinctly separatist character.127 Historically, the region had only the loosest association with the rest of the subcontinent and was much more culturally bound to neighboring areas of Burma than to the rest of India. By the early 1980s, the Assamese, Bodo, Naga, and Mizo peoples had launched a series of violent secessionist movements, many of which continue to the present day. In response, New Delhi imposed martial law and dispatched the military and central police forces to put down the rebellions. Rajiv 125 Poverty statistics based on consumption data from India’s National Sample Survey, as reported on: Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, “Central Statistical Organization: Reports and Publications,” http://mospi.gov.in/mospi_cso_rept_pubn.htm (accessed February 28, 2008). 126 Jawaid, 98-100. 127 Wolpert, 411. 41 Gandhi was able to negotiate a temporary suspension of hostilities in the late 1980s, but the arrangements soon fell apart, with the military redeployed to the Northeast in force by 1990.128 On the other side of the country, another, even bloodier secessionist movement emerged at roughly the same time. The Sikh community had agitated for a separate Sikh nation, notionally known as Khalistan, since around the time of Partition and Independence in 1947. The movement had been largely peaceful in the intervening decades, but by the late 1970s, it was becoming more belligerent. Under the leadership of J. S. Bhindranwale, a Sikh religious guru, armed members of the separatist Akali Dal Party stormed the Golden Temple at Amritsar in a direct challenge to New Delhi’s authority. In response to the rising violence and lawlessness throughout the Punjab, Indira’s actions were swift and uncompromising. In June of 1984, the Indian Army launched ‘Operation Bluestar,’ retaking the Golden Temple by force and inflicting massive casualties on its Sikh defenders.129 The operation cost Mrs. Gandhi her life (she was shortly thereafter assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards) and did not end the Khalistan movement immediately. It did, however, set the tone for the center’s response through the remainder of the decade.130 Extremely aggressive security actions continued, and ultimately proved successful in putting down the insurrection by the early 1990s. For the Naxalites, the impact of unrest in the Punjab and the Northeast was twofold. First, it seems likely that the threats to the integrity of the nation served to rally significant portions of the electorate to the government, giving New Delhi an added source of legitimacy. Much as the government enjoyed a boost of popularity in 1971-72 during the Indo-Pak war, the actions against the animist tribals and (especially) the Sikhs played well with India’s majority Hindu polity.131 This doubtlessly helped curtail the popularity of an anti-government ideology like Naxalism. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the aggressive response to each of these movements presented a daunting 128 Wolpert, 425-426. 129 Ibid., 416-418. 130 Ibid., 423-425. 131 Ibid., 418. 42 challenge to any other would-be troublemakers. As historian Stanley Wolpert notes, “The stunning, shocking violence of Operation Bluestar served to put every minority in India on immediate notice of just how dangerous continued opposition to Delhi could be.”132 The Naxalites could certainly be included as one of these minority groups. As we shall see, however, the most potent enemy of Naxalism in this period was the internal disarray of the movement itself. C. INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NAXALITE INSURGENCY 1. Organization and Leadership Following the death of Charu Mazumdar in 1972, the Naxalites underwent a process of fragmentation that severely crippled the movement over the ensuing decades. Though their total numbers stayed relatively steady, with most estimates in the neighborhood of 15,000 activists nationwide, the leadership was increasingly driven by ideological and operational differences of opinion.133 While the failures of the previous period were the immediate catalyst for this phenomenon, the movement had displayed factionalist tendencies almost from its inception. At the organizational meetings of the AICCCR in 1969, two groups parted ways with the nascent CPI-(ML) from the outset. The first of these was the Andhra faction of Naxalites under the leadership of Nagi Reddy. Reddy differed with Mazumdar’s formulations on a number of points, most crucially the blanket ban on elections and the single-minded emphasis on the annihilation strategy at the expense of economic struggles and mass organization.134 After being disaffiliated from the AICCCR, Reddy formed his own organization in 1969, the Andhra Pradesh Revolutionary Communist Committee (APRCC). While the APRCC was initially larger than the CPI-(ML), Reddy’s arrest in late 1969 severely curtailed its activities.135 In the 1970s, the APRCC broke up into a 132 Wolpert, 418. 133 New York Times, “Maoist Extremists Reappear in India,” October 12, 1980. 134 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 154-156. 135 Ibid., 34. 43 number of smaller organizations, the two most significant of which were the Unity Center of Communist Revolutionaries of India (UCCRI) led by Nagi Reddy himself and Chandra Pulla Reddy’s Revolutionary Communist Center (RCC).136 While both groups were marginally active in Andhra Pradesh through the 1970s, they underwent numerous splits themselves in the latter half of the decade. By 1990, these smaller groups had either withered to inconsequence or been absorbed by other Naxalite outfits. The other faction that split from the AICCCR in 1969 was known as Dakshin Desh. Its leaders, Amulya Sen and Kanai Chatterjee, also disagreed with Mazumdar over the necessity of mass organization and established their own group, initially based in West Bengal. With the government crackdowns of 1970-71, Dakshin Desh moved its operations to Bihar, changing its name to the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) in 1975.137 Though relatively small, the MCC remained a more or less coherent organization over the course of these two decades. The same could certainly not be said for Charu Mazumdar’s CPI-(ML). The party had always been a relatively fragile construct of disparate personalities and ideologies, but after the setbacks of 1971-1972, it underwent a dizzying process of fractionalization that resulted in the emergence of literally dozens of competing groups. As the smaller organizations were often short-lived and of little real significance in the future development of the movement, only the most important will be enumerated here. Following Mazumdar’s death in 1972, the CPI-(ML) split into two broad camps: those who supported his ideology, strategy, and tactics, and those who opposed them. The pro-Mazumdar camp was further divided in 1973, with Lin Biao’s fall from grace in the Chinese Communist Party. A source of great inspiration for Mazumdar’s ideology, his disavowal by the Chinese generated contentious ideological debate within this branch of Naxalism.138 The pro-Mazumdar/pro-Lin Biao faction, a distinct minority, regrouped in West Bengal under the leadership of Mahadev Mukherjee.139 The pro-Mazumdar/anti- 136 Banerjee, 166, 298. 137 Prakash Singh, 115-116. 138 Banerjee, 246. 139 Ghosh, 175-177. 44 Lin Biao faction emerged in Bihar as CPI-(ML) Liberation, and in Andhra Pradesh as the Central Organizing Committee CPI-(ML), or COC-(ML).140 The COC-(ML) would itself split in 1977, with one faction, led by Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, reestablishing itself in 1980 as CPI-(ML) People’s War Group, or PWG, in Andhra Pradesh.141 Among the anti-Mazumdar camp, the shakeout in this period was somewhat less confusing. The largest group emerged under the leadership of Satyanarayan Singh, the erstwhile Secretary of the CPI-(ML)’s Bihar State Committee. Singh had fallen out with Mazumdar in late 1971 over the latter’s authoritarian tendencies and seemingly suicidal tactical injunctions. In November of that year, Singh and a number of similarly disenchanted leaders formed a parallel leadership and actually expelled Mazumdar from his own party.142 Though most of the Naxalite rank-and-file did not initially accept this, Singh attracted a sizeable following after Mazumdar’s passing. His organization, known as CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh, was the largest and most influential of the post-Mazumdar Naxalite groups in the 1970s.143 The only other sizeable anti-Mazumdar group to emerge was Bihar’s CPI-(ML) Unity Committee, led by Khokan Mazumdar (no relation to Charu). In 1982, this group merged with the Bihar faction of the COC-(ML) to form the CPI-(ML) Party Unity, with Naveen Prasad as its new leader.144 While the proliferation of groups in this period might give an impression of vitality, the splintering of the movement was actually indicative of a great deal of uncertainty and acrimony in the ranks. While all still agreed on the need for a Maoist\u0002inspired political revolution in the country, Mazumdar’s death and the fallout from the failures of the 1965-1972 period had left the Naxalites confused and quarrelsome, on issues both practical and ideological. Cries of ‘revisionism’ by one group were answered with counteraccusations of ‘left-adventurism’ from another. The resultant infighting left 140 Prakash Singh, 156; Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 22. 141 Prakash Singh, 130. 142 Ghosh, 139-144, 151. 143 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 10. 144 Prakash Singh, 159-160. 45 the cadres demoralized and the leadership even more hopelessly divided.145 Perhaps no issue generated more contention than the most appropriate strategy to pursue in the post\u0002Mazumdar era. 2. Strategy and Tactics Following the security crackdowns in 1971-72, most of the Naxalite groups initially continued to advocate a violent strategy. With the memories of government repression fresh in their minds, this was not altogether surprising – most of their leaders continued to languish in prison, often under harsh conditions. Dakshin Desh and the pro\u0002Lin Biao faction in West Bengal were particularly vociferous in their agitation for a continuation of the annihilation policy. The other groups placed more rhetorical emphasis on building up mass organizations, but they too were initially unwilling to forswear armed struggle against the hated oppressors.146 However, with the end of the Emergency and the rise of the first Janata government, a more moderate position began to emerge within a key segment of the Naxalite movement. The CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh was the first major organization to change tack. Negotiating with Janata politicians from his jail cell after the 1977 elections, Singh’s aversion to electoral politics and compromise with the state softened. In a surprise move, he released a press statement in April 1977 expressing his “critical support” for the new Janata government and vowing that his group would participate in the assembly elections of June of that year.147 The formerly staunch advocate of the annihilation strategy went so far as to announce, “We wish to state categorically here that violence is not our ideology. Our ideology is Marxism-Leninism.”148 Though he justified this ideological reversal on the grounds that it would secure the release of political prisoners and enable the Maoists to present their platform to more of the population than ever before, his move 145 Jawaid, 94-95. 146 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 11. 147 Ibid., 14. 148 Prakash Singh, 121-122. 46 was viewed as treason by the rest of the movement.149 However, when the Janata government delivered on its promises of clemency and one of Singh’s candidates was actually elected in West Bengal (Santosh Rana, formerly the leader of the Midnapur uprising), his approach was vindicated in the eyes of many Naxalites. Even such old\u0002school stalwarts as Kanu Sanyal and Ashim Chatterjee eventually gave Singh’s strategy their grudging endorsement.150 Throughout the rest of the 1970s and 80s, CPI-(ML) Liberation and various lesser organizations followed the CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh’s lead and slowly moderated their stance. To be sure, it took time for the incidences of violence to diminish, and many of these groups stressed that they still retained the option of armed revolution.151 Nevertheless, they increasingly normalized their activities, allying themselves with leftist political parties and contesting elections at the state level through front organizations in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal.152 For other groups, however, rapprochement with any government forces, whatever their political stripes, remained anathema. The MCC, COC-(ML), and CPI-(ML) Unity Committee acknowledged the need for a greater emphasis on mass organization, but only in support of armed agrarian revolution.153 The latter two organizations splintered in the late 1970s, but their descendants carried on their two-pronged strategy of mass mobilization and violent opposition in the subsequent decade. Both the PWG and Party Unity continued the killing of jotedars and other class enemies, but not as single-mindedly as the CPI-(ML) had in the past. They also established aboveground organizations to agitate for land reform and minimum wages, and began setting up parallel administrations to dispense justice and other government functions that were lacking in the remote areas where they operated.154 Interestingly, the PWG was also able to attract some support by waging a 149 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 14-15. 150 Prakash Singh, 123. 151 Ibid., 158. 152 Tilak, 19-20; Prakash Singh, 123. 153 Prakash Singh, 123. 154 Ibid., 133-134. 47 campaign against social vice in the villages, which included crusades against drunkenness, gambling, and prostitution.155 Despite their avowed commitment to a similarly multi-pronged approach, the MCC was generally less successful in these secondary endeavors. During the 1980s, the group was best known for the gruesome nature of its continuing annihilations, still directed primarily at upper caste landlords.156 At the tactical level, those groups espousing violence began implementing more realistic methods in their continued pursuit of armed revolution. Discarding the Charuist aversion to modern weaponry, most actively encouraged the capture of guns from jotedars and police.157 While this slowly improved the Naxalites’ firepower, their operations remained dominated by small squad-level actions, and were generally unsophisticated in terms of their planning and execution. In the late 1980s, the PWG did receive some training from LTTE rebels in more advanced tactics, including the use of explosives. This enabled them to successfully carry out a land-mine attack against police forces in 1989, providing a deadly portent of things to come.158 For the most part, however, major improvements in the Maoists’ operational capabilities would not come until well into the next decade. 3. Naxalite Activity As fundamental as it was, the split between those groups that followed the Singh line of political normalization and those that continued with the strategy of violence was just one of a host of divisions that spread like a cancer through the movement. Even groups on the same side of the strategic divide remained pitted against one another over issues of personality or ideology, and fratricide was not uncommon.159 In this contentious environment, there was little hope of consolidation or cooperation. Split as 155 Prakash Singh, 137-138. 156 Ibid., 151-153. 157 Ibid., 136 , 151. 158 Ibid., 140-141. 159 Ibid., 155. 48 they were into numerous smaller groupings, the Naxalites’ activity in this period was generally circumscribed and remained restricted to a few small geographic areas. Throughout the early and mid-1970s, a combination of effective security efforts and the imprisonment of most of the leadership put a stop to almost all violent Naxalite activity. Indeed, brief periods of unrest were recorded in only two places: northern West Bengal and Bhojpur district in Bihar. The agitation in West Bengal erupted in 1973, led by the pro-Mazumdar/pro-Lin Biao faction of Mahadev Mukherjee. For about a year, actions against police forces resulted in several dozen deaths and the seizure of a similar number of firearms, but the uprising fizzled with Mukherjee’s arrest towards the end of 1974.160 The activity in Bhojpur was slightly longer lived, lasting from 1972-1977, and was led by CPI-(ML) Liberation. Still committed to violent revolution at this stage, the group carried out a number of annihilations against class enemies with the support of local tribes. Still, the uprising was a small-scale affair, accounting for only around ninety deaths over the entire five-year period, with its longevity due more to the state government’s anemic response than the actual strength of the insurgency. Like its counterpart in West Bengal, it was put down relatively easily with the introduction of more aggressive security measures, this time from the center.161 The late 1970s witnessed the dramatic announcements of Satyanarayan Singh and the political normalization of a number of Naxalite groups. Though gradual, this proved to be an enduring phenomenon, and the CPI-(ML) S.N.Singh and its followers largely retreated from violent activities. Though still active politically, their strategic course change effectively removed them from the Naxalite fold by the early 1980s, at least for the purposes of this thesis. As for the more recalcitrant Maoists, two dozen smaller groups remained minimally active in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and a number of southern states.162 Between them all, however, they accounted for only a handful of incidents and even fewer deaths. Throughout the 1980s, the only groups of 160 Ghosh, 175-177. 161 Prakash Singh, 117-119. 162 Ibid., 124. 49 any real significance were the PWG in Andhra Pradesh, and what the Indian security official Prakash Singh dubbed the ‘New Left’ in Bihar.163 Formed in April 1980 by Kandapalli Seetharamaiah, the PWG quickly became the most powerful Naxalite organization in the country. Though this latter fact was admittedly not much of a boast during this period, they were a disruptive influence in their primary area of operations, the perennially restive and underdeveloped Telangana region.164 While the group did engage in rudimentary social projects and set up a number of peasant organizations to help mobilize the masses in pursuit of economic goals, Seetharamaiah was also a firm believer in Mazumdar’s annihilation strategy. As Table 1 shows, the group grew increasingly violent under his leadership, with attacks on jotedars, police, and police informants.165 Though still relatively contained by the end of the 1980s, the PWG was already demonstrating the bloody ruthlessness that would distinguish it in later decades. The ‘New Left’ in Bihar emerged at roughly the same time as the PWG. Comprised of the MCC, Party Unity, and CPI-(ML) Liberation, the title may give a misleading impression of cooperation amongst the groups. In reality, they fought each other nearly as often as they engaged ‘class enemies,’ often in petty squabbles over turf or ideological nuances. 163 Prakash Singh, 124. 164 Ibid., 129-141. 165 Ibid., 140 YEAR INCIDENTS KILLED 1981 53 10 1982 98 18 1983 172 17 1984 306 30 1985 308 30 1986 161 25 1987 252 63 1988 453 59 1989 456 84 1990 735 94 Table 1. Naxalite Violence in Andhra Pradesh 50 Nevertheless, they too managed to make an impact at the state level. Like Telangana, Bihar remained beyond the reach of many of the government’s reform initiatives, and pockets of rural unrest continued to provide havens for Naxalite cadres.166 Though Liberation was the largest of the three groups, its gradual embrace of electoral politics over the course of the decade made it the least violently active. It maintained an armed wing into the 1990s, but its aboveground political organization, the Indian People’s Front, increasingly supplanted the influence of its more belligerent cadres.167 The faction favoring normalization gained dominance in 1992, and Liberation thereafter functioned primarily as an aboveground outfit, focused almost exclusively on peaceful mass organization.168 In a telling signal of the extent of their moderation, its leaders even called for rapprochement with the formerly despised CPI and CPI-(M), in an effort to build a more coordinated leftist political front.169 By contrast, the MCC and Party Unity remained exclusively committed to armed revolution. Mass organization was desirable, but in the context of a burgeoning caste conflict in the state during this period, often difficult to mobilize along exclusively class lines. Instead, the annihilation strategy was pursued with a decidedly grisly purpose, particularly by the MCC. In most cases, upper caste jotedars and their families were the primary targets but, with the conflation of caste and class conflicts in the state, the sadistic nature of the killings failed to generate the same backlash that had occurred previously. As a result, both the MCC and Party Unity were able to carve out small areas of influence in Bihar over the latter half of the 1980s.170 As in Andhra Pradesh, however, this level of activity remained a far cry from that of 1967-1972. 166 Prakash Singh, 148-160. 167 Tilak, 19. 168 Prakash Singh, 158. 169 Tilak, 20. 170 Prakash Singh, 148-156, 159-160. 51 D. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 1. Center Responses From the halls of power in New Delhi, Naxalism appeared to be a spent force after 1972. With the center caught up in the drama of systemic political change and the growth of ethnic secessionist movements over these two decades, relatively scant attention was paid to the fractured and localized Maoist movement in the country. Nevertheless, as alluded in Section 3.2, developments at the national level did have an impact on the Naxalites. With the INC’s turn to a more populist platform, new rural development and land reform initiatives effectively undercut the movement’s base of support. With rural inequality receding rather than growing, the more militant cadres had a much harder time finding sympathetic base areas from which to operate. Even for those sections of the movement that drifted in a more moderate direction, the government’s schemes were successful in stealing their rhetorical thunder and foiling most attempts at mass organization; Naxalite candidates did not generally have much success at the polls, Santosh Rana’s success notwithstanding.171 While these developments posed indirect problems for the Naxalites, a much more immediate challenge emerged with the imposition of the Emergency in 1975. Though not primarily directed at the Naxalites, the resultant political and security crackdowns hit the movement hard. Like most other opposition groups, all Naxalite organizations were banned and scores of leaders and party activists rearrested under the newly instituted Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA).172 Among them were some of the Maoists’ most effective organizers, including Kanu Sanyal, Ashim Chatterjee, and Satyanarayan Singh. Moreover, the security forces were given wide latitude in dealing with whatever opposition escaped the prison cell. Frequently, this entailed direct action like that of ‘Operation Thunder,’ which crushed the long-simmering 171 Prakash Singh, 211-212. 172 Banerjee, 297. 52 unrest in Bhojpur with combined operations by the military and Central Reserve Police forces in 1977.173 Already in tatters after Mazumdar’s death, the Naxalite movement was nearly destroyed by the center’s expanded powers during the Emergency.174 Ironically, it was also New Delhi that granted it a new lease on life. The Janata government’s promises to undo the excesses of the Emergency resulted in the release of hundreds of Naxalite prisoners all across the country in 1977 and 1978, the legalization of most of their organizations, and the easing of pressure by government security forces.175 While this ultimately had the effect of moderating several factions and co\u0002opting them into the political process, it also freed the more hard-core cadres to resume their subversive activities. Though the INC returned to power in New Delhi in 1980, it did not resume its previous activities against the Naxalites. In part, this was due to the still extremely weak state of the movement. More importantly, however, the government already had its hands full with the growing unrest in Punjab and the Northeast. Nevertheless, the center’s security initiatives with respect to these other regions reverberated among the Naxalites. The extremely aggressive response to these insurgencies likely helped convince the more moderate Maoists that the path of armed rebellion was untenable and provided some deterrent effect even to their more violent-minded brethren. Whatever the case, Naxalite violence remained at a sufficiently low ebb through the 1980s to permit the central government to largely dismiss it as a local law and order problem. The same could not necessarily be said for those states that were more directly affected. 2. State Responses As the birthplace of Naxalism, West Bengal had the longest history in dealing with the insurgency. While effective policing put down the 1973-74 uprising of Mahadev Mukherjee’s faction, rural unrest continued to simmer under a series of Congress administrations. When a Left Front coalition government returned to power in 1977, 173 Prakash Singh, 119. 174 Mehra, 51-52. 175 Prakash Singh, 122; Tilak, 12. 53 however, the situation changed dramatically. Led by the CPI-(M), the new administration proved much more competent and enduring than its predecessors. Under its direction, West Bengal instituted a series of land redistribution and rural development initiatives that proved remarkably successful. One of these was ‘Operation Barga,’ which established strict ceilings on total landholdings by individuals and granted inheritable ownership rights to tenant farmers and sharecroppers.176 Unencumbered by the political compromises, conflicts of interest, and enforcement issues that so often plagued center\u0002led efforts, these state-level reforms removed the Maoists’ raison d’etre in a few short years. By the early 1980s, Naxalism had ceased to be a force of any consequence in the state.177 Though not as successful as West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh was able to mount an intermittently effective counter to its Naxalite problem. The TDP, which came to power in 1983, initially pursued a policy of appeasement with the PWG in an effort to lure them to peace talks. When it became clear that the group had no intention of negotiating in good faith (and had, in fact, used the opportunity to consolidate and strengthen their positions), the state’s Chief Minister, N.T. Rama Rao, adopted a hard line against the Naxalites.178 Rao authorized aggressive policing measures against PWG cadres and oversaw the formation of the Greyhounds, the state’s elite anti-Naxal police unit, in the late 1980s.179 Though he supported aggressive security measures, Rao did not neglect the rural development initiatives that had proved so successful in West Bengal. Land reform and rural employment initiatives were implemented with moderate success, but a lack of government infrastructure in remoter parts of the state made their implementation there difficult.180 In 1989, the INC returned to power in state elections, but initially made the same early mistakes as the TDP. The new Chief Minister, Chenna Reddy, tried to 176 Prakash Singh, 179. 177 Mehra, 56; Prakash Singh, 236. 178 Prakash Singh, 139. 179 Andhra Pradesh State Police, “Units: Greyhounds,” http://www.apstatepolice.org/AboutUs/units/units_greyhounds.htm (accessed February 4, 2008). 180 K.C. Suri, “Telugu Desam Party,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 294-295. 54 appease the PWG in a vain attempt to lure them into the mainstream, releasing several hundred Naxalite prisoners rounded up under the previous administration.181 When this approach failed again, Reddy reverted to Rao’s combination of tough policing and socio\u0002economic development. Despite these ups and downs, the state was relatively successful in confining the PWG to the Telangana region and a few neighboring districts throughout the 1980s. By contrast, the containment of the MCC and Party Unity in Bihar had little to do with the state government. The Janata Party captured control of the state briefly, from 1977 to 1980, but the remainder of this period was dominated by INC administrations. In reality, however, it scarcely mattered who controlled the government. Corruption, cronyism, and maladministration took root in Bihar in the 1970s and continued to flourish through the 1980s.182 Unable to mount effective security or development initiatives of any kind, the government essentially left the rural parts of the state to their own devices, providing space for the embers of Naxalism to smolder. While the growth of caste conflict in the state, as well as internecine fighting between the MCC and PU, were enough to keep the Naxalites more or less in check during these decades, the state’s appallingly poor governance would become an issue in the future resurgence of Naxalism. E. CONCLUSION The Fragmentary Period was a prolonged low point in the history of Naxalism in India. After its brief but significant surge from 1967 to 1972, the movement underwent a period of stagnation and decay that lasted nearly two decades and effectively removed it from the public consciousness. Though not as captivating a story as the vitality of the previous period, the impotence of the movement and its singular inability to gain traction during these years are still worthy of examination. 181 Sanjoy Hazarika, “Indian Rebel Group is Linked to Train Attack,” New York Times, October 21, 1990. 182 Prakash Singh, 148-150. 55 The most obvious reason for the failure of Naxalism in this period was its own organizational weakness. Fractured into dozens of smaller, competing factions, it was too dispersed and fragmented to mount any kind of meaningful challenge to the forces of the Indian state. In large part, this was a failure of leadership. Consumed by their personal egos, strategic and tactical differences, and ideological arguments incomprehensible to any but the most dogmatic Marxists, the heads of the various Naxalite organizations were utterly incapable of resolving their disputes and coordinating the activities of their disparate groups. As a consequence, a large portion of the movement effectively abandoned the revolutionary line, and those that remained were confined to a few small pockets of activity in the hinterlands. With the structure of the movement in such a state, its success would have been unlikely in even a permissive security environment. As it turned out, the security environment was decidedly unfavorable. The imposition of the Emergency in the 1970s granted the state a great deal of leeway in dealing with opposition movements, and it used them to devastating affect against the already fragmented Naxalites. Indeed, the movement was very nearly destroyed by policing actions like Operation Thunder and the imprisonment of hundreds, if not thousands of its activists. The situation in the 1980s was hardly any better. Though New Delhi’s aggressive reactions to the various secessionist uprisings in the country were not directed against the Maoists, they still provided a powerful deterrent effect. Lastly, the social, economic, and political conditions in the country were not conducive to the spread of Naxalite ideology. Political changes at the systemic level gave a new voice to groups the Maoists traditionally relied on for support, making the government more responsive to their needs. As a result, land reforms and rural development became a priority at both the state and national levels. While these programs were not always perfectly implemented, poverty rates did decline, and real and perceived inequity were alleviated to some degree. These issues had been drivers of rural unrest in the previous period, and the government’s efforts to address them proved generally successful in keeping the countryside peaceful during these decades. 56 To most observers in 1991, the Naxalist threat appeared to be over. The movement had been wiped out in the state of its birth, sizeable numbers of its former adherents were embracing electoral democracy, and, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Communism was being discredited around the world. In isolated pockets of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, however, the embers of the Maoist revolution continued to smolder. In places the rural reforms had scarcely reached, the People’s War Group, Maoist Communist Center, and Party Unity continued to cling to existence, waiting for the right moment to reignite the fire of Naxalbari. 57 IV. THE RECONSOLIDATION PERIOD (1991-PRESENT) A. INTRODUCTION With an analysis of the first two periods of Naxalite activity complete, this chapter now turns to the most recent iteration of Maoist violence in India. In an examination of the historical evolution of Naxalism, the period from 1991 to the present is certainly the most paradoxical. In the course of little more than 17 years, India has transformed from a large, but isolated and relatively weak state, to one of the central players in the emerging geopolitical order. Its macroeconomic growth is astounding, second only to China in the developing world, and its diplomatic clout on the world stage has increased commensurately. To many outside observers, India looks to be successfully integrating itself into the modern world. And yet, in those same 17 years, an archaic Communist ideology, rejected even in the place of its birth, was also in the ascendancy. Written off by most security analysts in the ashes of the Fragmentary Period from 1972-1991, Naxalism staged a spectacular comeback in the following decades, growing in scope, breadth, and violence. By 2006, its impact was so great that Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was forced to declare, “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problem of Naxalism is the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”183 This is certainly a startling announcement for a nation that suffered through the chaos of Partition, witnessed the violence of a Sikh rebellion in the Punjab, and is still confronted by the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, various insurgencies in the Northeast, fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and continuing Hindu-Muslim communal strife. What explains Naxalism’s phoenix-like rebirth in a period that has witnessed such phenomenal growth and national development? 183 Manmohan Singh, “Prime Minister’s Speech to the 2nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of Chief Ministers on Naxalism,” 13 April 2006, Government of India Press Information Bureau, http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=17128, (accessed August 10, 2007). 58 B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments Since 1991, the most striking development in Indian politics has been the emergence of a truly multi-polar power structure. The declining hegemony of the INC (discussed in the previous chapter) dramatically accelerated during the 1990s, fuelled by the emergence of the “Three M’s” on the political scene: Mandir, Mandal, and Market Reforms.184 In 1998, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition unseated the previous INC administration and inaugurated the longest period of uninterrupted rule by a non\u0002Congress party since independence. Though the INC returned to power in 2004, the BJP’s ascendancy in the 1990s definitively marked the end of one-party dominance in India, resulting in a more complex and contentious political setting than at any other time in the nation’s history. Minority governments and coalition politics are now the order of the day, severely restricting New Delhi’s freedom of action in addressing many pressing issues. In many ways, this increasing gridlock at the national level is reflected in interactions between the central government and those of the states. India’s political structure is distinctly federal, with the 28 state and 7 union territory governments retaining high levels of autonomy from New Delhi, barring the infrequent imposition of ‘President’s Rule’ from the center. This is particularly true with respect to internal security, an area in which the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India grants the individual states great authority and latitude.185 Such a division of powers presents obvious problems for policy coordination, especially when different parties control the various levels of government. This situation was not much of an issue in earlier decades, 184 ‘Mandir’ refers to Hindu Nationalism, ‘Mandal’ to the recommendations of the Mandal Commission report on the status of backward castes, and ‘Market Reforms’ to the economic reforms inaugurated in 1991. For an excellent exposition of these phenomena and their impact on Indian politics, see: Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952- 2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed.

    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#content) Author ### [Pearl Pandya](https://acleddata.com/staff/pearl-pandya) South Asia Research Manager _On 21 May, Indian security forces killed the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI (Maoist)), Nambala Keshava Rao, also known as Basavaraju, in Chhattisgarh state. He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&nbsp;_ _In this Q&A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world._ ## **The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it?** The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed.[1](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote1) So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( _see graph below_). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.[2](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote2) Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts.[3](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote3) Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. Close footnote ## How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also [targeted locals](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/) whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes.[4](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote4) Close footnote ## What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk.[5](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote5) And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so.

SFs recovered one AK47 rifle, one Light Machine Gun (LMG) and explosives from the encounter spot. The identities of the slain Maoists are yet to be ascertained. On April 5, 2024, one CPI-Maoist cadre was gunned down by SFs in the forest area near Kirandul in the Dantewada District of Chhattisgarh. During the search, SFs recovered the dead body of the Maoist, his weapon and explosives from the encounter site. On April 2, 2024, 13 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in a forest near Lendra village under the Gangaloor Police Station limits of the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh. The identity of the dead Maoists was yet to be ascertained, but _prima facie_, it appeared that they belonged to the Maoist’s PLGA (People's Liberation Guerrilla Army) Company No. 2, a senior Police official disclosed. Police recovered weapons, including a Light Machine Gun (LMG), a .303 rifle, and a 12-bore gun, along with a substantial quantity of barrel grenade launchers, shells, and other arms and ammunition, from the site. On April 1, 2024, two CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in the Kerajhari Forest of the Balaghat District in Madhya Pradesh. The Police recovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist ‘divisional committee member (DCM)’ Sajanti _aka_ Kranti and ‘area committee member (ACM)’ Raghu _aka_ Sher Singh (54), both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounty announcements by the Police in three states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Elsewhere on the same day, one CPI-Maoist cadre was killed in an encounter with SFs in the forest area near Tetemadgu village under Kistaram Police Station limits in the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh. The dead body of the Maoist and his weapons were recovered from the encounter site. The identity of the slain Maoist is yet to be ascertained. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), at least 58 _Naxalites_ \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] have been killed by the SFs during the current year, 2024 (data till April 7). During the corresponding period of 2023, SFs had eliminated nine _Naxalites_. Through 2023, SFs killed 58 _Naxalites_, in addition to 67 killed in 2022. According to the SATP database, SFs arrested 401 _Naxalites_ in 2023 as against 395 arrests in 2022. In 2024, as on April 7, the number of arrests stood at 92. Since March 6, 2000, according to SATP data, 16,364 _Naxalites_ have been arrested (data till April 7, 2024). Through 2023, SFs recovered weapons and ammunition from the Maoists in 223 incidents, in addition to 193 such incidents of recovery in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the number of such incidents was 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,917 incidents of arms recovery are on record. Mounting pressure on the _Naxalites_ has resulted in a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP data, at least 254 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2023, in addition to 2,855 surrenders in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, 42 surrenders have been recorded. Since March 6, 2000, 16,780 _Naxalites_ have surrendered (data till April 7, 2024). Continuing SF successes on the ground further improved the overall security situation through 2023. The trend of declining overall fatalities, on year-on-year basis, in Left Wing Extremism-related violence, has been established since 2018, though a marginal reversal occurred in 2023 at around 11.11 per cent (from 135 in 2022 to 150 in 2023). According to SATP data, a total of 150 people (61 civilians, 31 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_) were killed in such violence through 2023, as against 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) recorded in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the total number of such fatalities stood at 93 (22 civilians, 13 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_), as against 37 such fatalities (19 civilians, nine SF personnel and nine _Naxalites_) reported during the corresponding period of 2023. According to SATP data, the number of civilian fatalities (61) recorded through 2023 was the third lowest in this category since 2000. Two other previous lows were recorded at 53 in 2022 and 58 in 2021. A third low of 61 was also recorded in 2020. The maximum number of civilians killed in such violence, 630, was in 2010. Though the number of fatalities among SFs increased from 15 in 2022 to 31 in 2023, according to SATP data, the number of fatalities in 2023 was the second lowest in this category since 2000. A previous low of 15 was recorded in 2022. The maximum number of SFs killed in such violence, 319, was in 2009. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2023, at 1:1.87, improving the ratio in favour of the SFs in 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2022, the ratio was at 1:4.46, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Also, in 2009 the ratio was at 1.01:1. In 2007, the ratio was at 1.2:1 favouring the Maoists. However, since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.63). In the current year, the kill ratio remains in favour of the SFs at 1:4.46, so far (data till April 7, 2024). Other parameters of violence indicate that, despite sustained SF pressure, the Maoists but retain significant operational capabilities across the country. At least eight major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) were recorded in 2023, compared to seven such incidents in 2022. There were 89 incidents of exchange of fire between SFs and Maoist in 2023, compared to 86 such incidents in 2022. Further, the Maoists orchestrated at least 62 incidents of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in 2023, compared to 32 such incidents in 2022. Moreover, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents of violence increased marginally from 602 in 2022 to 603 in 2023. In particular, incidents in which the Maoists killed civilians and SFs increased from 63 in 2022 to 77 in 2023. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from 12 States in 2023, in comparison to 10 States in 2022. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 12 affected States have a total of 83 Districts which recorded a Maoist presence. Of these, seven districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 20 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 56 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2022, of 57 affected districts from 10 states, two districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 27 were ‘marginally affected’. However, in a written reply to a question in the _Rajya Sabha_ (Upper House of the Indian Parliament) on February 7, 2024, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai claimed that the resolute implementation of the “National Policy and Action Plan (NPAP) to address LWE” approved in 2015, resulted in a consistent decline in violence and constriction of the geographical spread of LWE influence. LWE-related violence and resultant deaths (Civilians + Security Forces) declined by 73 per cent from a high in 2010, by 90 per cent in 2022, and by 86 per cent in 2023. Further, Rai stated that the number of Police Stations reporting LWE-related violence had reduced significantly, from 465 Police Stations across 96 districts in 2010 to 176 Police Stations across 45 districts in 2022 and 171 Police Stations across 42 districts in 2023. Clearly, all major LWE-affected states across the country – see Andhra Pradesh’s **[Residual Vexations](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-29#assessment2)**, Bihar’s **[Halted Menace](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-35#assessment2)**, Chhattisgarh’s **[Persisting Disruptions](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-33#assessment2)**, Jharkhand’s **[Risks amidst decline](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-31#assessment2)**, Madhya Pradesh’s **[Enduring Risks](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-41#assessment2)**, Maharashtra’s **[Ineffective ‘Revival’](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-36#assessment2)**, Odisha’s **[Enduring challenges](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-34#assessment2)**, and Telangana’s **[Sustained Dominance](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-37#assessment2)** have recorded substantial improvement in the security situation in the regions affected by LWE activity. Earlier, on January 21, 2024, the union home minister (UHM) Amit Shah, had asserted that the country would be free from the menace of _Naxalism_ in the next three years, and directed states to expedite development activities in remote areas affected by the ultras. UHM Shah also directed the Security Forces (SFs) to financially choke the ultras and instructed officials to prepare a blueprint to end _Naxalism_. He also stressed the need for expediting development in _Naxalite_-affected areas, asserting that all welfare schemes of the central and state governments would have to be implemented in these areas with renewed vigour. Meanwhile, on January 11, 2024, the Chhattisgarh government invited Maoists to hold unconditional talks, suggesting \"video calls if they are reluctant to come for physical meetings\". Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma, who holds the state's Home portfolio, stating that this would be a step towards restoring peace and stability in the Bastar region, thus observed, | | | --- | | We are prepared to provide Naxalites an online platform to express their grievances, ideas and desires. I am open to discussions with the young cadres any time, 24x7, without any conditions. I am available for any topic the Naxalites wish to discuss, but they must be willing to engage. If they regret their decision to join the outfit or wish to reintegrate with mainstream society, I extend my hand to them and urge them to lead a peaceful life and serve the country. | While holding out an olive branch, the Government made it clear that there would be no softening of stance. The Deputy Chief Minister thus warned, | | | --- | | If they fail to grasp the importance of dialogue, they will have to pay for the pain they have inflicted on our people ('dard ka hisaab hoga'). They must understand that peace talks cannot occur with guns and bullets. A well-ordered society is not governed by firearms. We want to discuss what they desire, why they carry weapons, why they mislead and trouble people, why they oppose progress in villages, and why they do not support the establishment of hospitals, schools, water facilities, and _anganwadis_. | Meanwhile, according to a March 21, 2024, media report, Chhattisgarh's Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma's call for unconditional dialogue with Maoists prompted a response from the CPI-Maoist, with the rebels presenting certain preconditions and emphasizing the necessity of a conducive environment for talks to ensure the welfare and lasting peace of oppressed and exploited segments of society. In a letter, CPI-Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) 'spokesman' Vikalp outlined several conditions before any agreement could be reached to engage in dialogue. These conditions included the cessation of atrocities and false encounters on tribals, halting militarization in tribal regions, withdrawing security forces, and annulling agreements with corporate entities. In a two-page letter dated March 15, 2024, Maoist spokesperson Vikalp declared that, if their demands were met, they would be ready to engage in dialogue via mobile phone calls. He noted, further, | | | --- | | We had previously responded to the invitation for talks, stating that our central agenda is none other than the overall development of the oppressed and harassed sections of society, including tribal, Dalit, Muslim, and minority communities, as well as farmers, women, and the middle class. Additionally, we advocate for equal pay for equal work based on gender equality and an end to state violence against women. | Vikalp also insisted on providing loan waivers for farmers, increasing agricultural subsidies, providing free irrigation and electricity, cancelling agreements with international companies, and implementing welfare schemes such as free education, housing, healthcare, and employment. The Maoists thus gave _bandh_ (general shut down strike) calls on their whims. In their latest call on March 30, 2024, the Maoists called for a _bandh_ in Bijapur and Sukma on April 3, 2024, to protest the killing of six Maoists in an encounter in the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh on March 27, 2024, which the rebels claimed was a \"fake encounter\". However, the _bandh_ calls were peaceful. Rejecting the allegations of fake encounters as \"old tactics\" of the Maoists, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar range, Sundarraj P., asserted, | | | --- | | It is the typical _modus operandi_ of Maoists to level allegations against the security forces to puncture the credibility of security forces. Maoists conveniently forget that they are responsible for brutal killings of hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians. Just to distract the attention from their inhumane behaviour, they issue these kinds of statements. All concerned understand the reality that the Maoists are facing their extinction. | Earlier, on March 26, 2024, Mohan, the ‘secretary’ of the CPI-Maoist West Bastar Division Committee, had issued a press note which announced that Bijapur would remain closed on March 30. In the note the Maoist leader accused the Police of killing 15 tribals since January. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government in Chhattisgarh has been accused of fake encounters, atrocities, and the eviction of tribals from forests and land, and denial of access to water resources. The Maoists warned transporters and businessmen that they would be responsible if they operated on March 30. However, the _bandh_ passed without any disruptive activities. The Maoists issued nine _Bandh_ calls in 2023 across the country, as against eight such calls in 2022. The Maoist movement has weakened, as the SFs now increasingly dominate areas long under LWE sway. Nevertheless, the capacities to sustain dominance remain limited. According to _Bureau of Police Research and Development_ (BPR&D) data, the all-India Police-population ratio was 152.80 (as on January 1, 2022), in comparison to 152.51 per 100,000 on January 1, 2021. Some of the Maoists’ affected States have much worse police-population ratios: Bihar, at 75.16; Odisha at 122.59; and Maharashtra at 136.45. Even in States like Jharkhand, where the police-population ratio, at 162.73, exceeds the national average, it remains much lower than the 220/100,000 ratio regarded as desirable for 'peacetime policing'. Moreover, there were 504 (17.59 per cent) vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) in the 12 affected States, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. Further, huge vacancies persist in the total strength of the State Police forces, which have been increasingly used in the fight against the _Naxalites_: there were 417,784 vacant posts in the 12 affected States, as on January 1, 2022, against a sanctioned strength of 1,642,759 (actual strength: 1,224,965). Significantly, these constituted 72.3 per cent of the 595,105 vacant posts across India, as on January 1, 2022. Moreover, against a sanctioned strength of 324,654 in the CRPF, the lead counter-insurgency Force in the country, the actual strength stood at 309,544, a vacancy of 15,110 personnel. Stark deficits are visible in some of the worst afflicted States. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2022, there were at least 22 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst _Naxalism_-affected State, which did not have a telephone. Similarly, the second worst affected State, Jharkhand, had 211 such Police Stations without telephone connections. The number of Police Stations without a vehicle in Jharkhand was 47, while 31 Police stations in the state hand no wireless/mobile phone. The Maoists are certainly losing their impact across the country; however, the danger of resurgence remains alive. There is urgent need to build the necessary capacities to sustain, indeed, heighten pressure at this stage, in order to consolidate the gains of recent years. | [Assessments Year

The slain Maoists were identified as Gautam Paswan, CPI-Maoist ‘Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee (BJSAC)’ member, who had a reward of INR 2.5 million on his head; Ajit Oraon _alias_ Charlis, BJSAC member, with an INR 2.5 million reward; Amar Ganjhu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; Ajay Yadav _alias_ Nandu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; and Sanjeet Bhuiyan, ‘sub-zonal commander’. During the search operation, the dead bodies of the five Maoists along with two AK-47 rifles, one INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, two other rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as items of daily use were recovered. On April 1, 2023, a CPI-Maoist cadre, Sameer Mohonda _alias_ Sadhu Linga (31), a member of the CPI-Maoist ‘Chatgaon Local Organizational Squad’, with a reward of INR 200,000 on his head, was killed in an encounter with C-60 Commandos in the Kiarkoti-Abujhmad Forest area of Bhamragarh _Taluka_ (revenue division) in the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra. Acting on intelligence inputs, the Commandos launched an operation and came under indiscriminate fire from a group of 60 to 70 Maoists hiding in the forest, who used Under Barrel Grenade Launchers (UBGLs) and other weapons. In the retaliatory fire, the C-60 Commandos killed one Maoist, while the others managed to flee into the dense forest. After the firing, which lasted for approximately an hour, the Security Forces (SFs) searched the area and recovered one .303 rifle, one gun, a country-made pistol, three magazines, 31 bullets, INR 38,000, medicines, Maoist literature and other materials. On March 28, 2023, a former deputy _Sarpanch_ (head of the _Panchayat_, village level local self-Government institution), Ramji Dodi, was abducted and killed by CPI-Maoist cadres in Zara village in the Narayanpur District of Chhattisgarh. Dodi was abducted, along with his two nephews, and taken to a forest where he was allegedly strangled to death by the Maoists. The nephews were released with Ramji’s body and a letter saying that he was killed because he was a ‘police informer’. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), there has been a total of 39 fatalities (20 civilians, nine SF personnel and 10 _Naxalites_, Left Wing Extremists) in Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-linked violence in the current year (data till April 9, 2023). During the corresponding period of 2022, the number of such fatalities was 49 (19 civilians, seven SF personnel and 23 _Naxalites_). Through 2022, there was a total of 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) in such violence. In the preceding year (2021), there was a total of 237 fatalities (58 civilians, 51 SF personnel, and 128 _Naxalites_). Overall fatalities were at 239 in 2020, 302 in 2019, 412 in 2018 and 335 in 2017. Overall fatalities have, thus, been on a decline since 2019. Moreover, the overall fatalities in 2022 were the lowest recorded in a single year since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE. Interestingly, the overall fatalities in 2021 were the pervious lowest recorded in a single year. A peak of 1,180 fatalities (630 civilians, 267 SF personnel, 265 _Naxalites_ and 18 unspecified) were recorded in 2010. As with overall fatalities, fatalities in 2022 in all three categories – civilian, SF and _Naxalite_ – were the lowest since 2000. A previous low of 58 in the civilian category was record in 2021. In the SF category, the previous low of 44 was recorded in 2020. A previous low of 87 in the _Naxalite_ category was recorded in 2004. Civilian and _Naxalite_ fatalities have also been on a continuous decline since 2019. SF fatalities have also declined through this period, barring 2021 (51 fatalities) when there was a spike compared to 2020 (44 fatalities). Other parameters of violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation relating to LWE activities across the country. The number of overall LWE-linked terrorist incidents fell from 676 in 2021 to 602 in 2022. In particular, incidents of killing came down from 124 in 2021 to 107 in 2022. Seven of the 107 overall incidents of killing were major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in 2022. In 2021, the number of major incidents was 15. Resultant fatalities from major incidents declined from 114 (seven civilians, 30 SF personnel, and 77 _Naxalites_) in 2021 to 22 (one civilian, three SF personnel, and 18 _Naxalites_) in 2022. In 2023, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents was 169, of which 32 were incidents of killing. Two major incidents have already been recorded in 2023. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2022, at 1:4.46, the best since 2000, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2021, the ratio was at 1:2.5. The ratio has remined in favour of the SFs since 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.61). In the current year, the kill ratio is in favour of the SFs at 1:1.11, so far (data till April 6, 2023). SFs arrested 395 _Naxalites_ in 2022, in addition to 409 in 2021, according to partial data compiled by SATP. In the current year, as on April 6, 2023, 122 arrests had been recorded. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, a total of 15,993 has been recorded. The mounting pressure on _Naxalites_ has yielded a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP, at least 2,855 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2022, in addition to 533 in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of surrenders was 97. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 16,581 LWEs have surrendered. Through 2022, SFs recovered arms from the Maoists in 190 incidents, in addition to 268 such incidents of recovery in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of such incidents are 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,694 incidents of arms recovery are documented. An analysis of over-ground and underground Maoist activities in the country’s LWE-affected areas also suggests a diminishing influence. According to SATP, in 2022, Maoist activities were reported from 10 States in comparison to 11 States in 2021. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 10 affected States have a total of 310 Districts, of which 58 recorded a Maoist presence. Of these 58, three districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 27 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 28 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2021, of 79 affected districts, one district fell in the ‘extremely-affected’ category, four in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 46 were ‘marginally affected’. Indeed, on March 28, 2023, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, in a written reply to a question in the _Lok Sabha_ (Lower House of the Indian Parliament), announced that the number of districts most affected by LWE had reduced from 35 in 2017 to 30 in April 2018, and then to 25 in July **[2021](https://pqals.nic.in/annex/1711/AU4464.pdf)**. Further, on March 28, 2023, the Government stated that the “geographical spread of violence has significantly reduced and only 176 Police Stations of 45 districts reported LWE violence in 2022, as compared to a high of 465 Police Stations of 96 districts in 2010”. Conspicuously, all major LWE-affected states across the country — **[Andhra Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-30)**, **[Bihar](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-31#assessment2)**, **[Chhattisgarh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-29#assessment2)**, **[Jharkhand](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-33#assessment2)**, **[Kerala](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-39#assessment2)**, **[Madhya Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-40#assessment2)**, **[Maharashtra](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-38#assessment2)**, **[Odisha](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-34#assessment2)**, and **[Telangana](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-37)** have witnessed an overall improvement in the security situation. Nevertheless, the Maoist challenge persists. OThe Perilous **[Bastar Division](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-22#assessment2)**, the safe haven of the residual Maoist problem not only in Chhattisgarh but across the entire LWE-affected region, comprising seven densely forested districts - Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur and Sukma - sprawling across 40,000 square kilometers, in the southernmost region of the state, is the location of the last Maoist bastions. On November 7, 2022, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar Range, Sundarraj P., asserting that the SFs were committed to wiping out the Maoist threat, nevertheless accepted, | | | --- | | In Bastar Range, though civilian killings have reduced to a great extent, from 279 in the year 2006, to 29 in 2022, it is still an area of major concern in left-wing extremist affected areas. | Indeed, on March 28, 2023, the Maoists abducted and killed two villagers, in Narayanpur and Sukma Districts, branding them as ‘Police informers’ (incidents mentioned above). Moreover, the early data for 2023 suggests that SF dominance on the ground, purely in terms of the kill ratio, has weakened during the first three months of 2023, as compared to the whole of 2022 and earlier. Not surprisingly, civilian insecurity has escalated. Disturbingly, more than a few deficits in the fighting forces remained noticeable in some of the worst Maoist-afflicted States, according to the _Bureau of Police Research & Development_ (BPR&D) data. BPR&D disclosed, as on January 1, 2021, that there were at least 28 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst affected State, that had no telephone. In Jharkhand, 47 had no vehicle, 211 had no telephone, and 31 had no wireless/mobile connectivity. In Andhra Pradesh, 65 Police Stations had no vehicle, and 34 had no wireless/mobile connectivity; and in Odisha, four had no vehicle, and three had no telephone. Moreover, large vacancies persist in the State Police Forces. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2021, against the sanctioned strength of 1,109,260 there were a total of 838,481 policemen in position in 10 LWE-affected States, leaving a vacancy of 270,779, i.e., 24.41 per cent. At the national level, deficits against sanctioned strength were 20.34 per cent, almost the same as the shortage in the Maoist affected States. The police-population ratio (policemen per hundred thousand population) of these 12 States had increased from an average of 138.63 in 2018 to 149.42 in 2019. Meanwhile, the all-India police-population ratio had increased from 150.80 in 2018 to 158.22 in 2019, significantly higher than the levels in the LWE affected States. Importantly, existing police-population ratios in these 12 states remained significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 183.97. At the national level, the existing levels were also significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 198.65 per 100,000. Moreover, the number of vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) of these 12 States was 595 (22.44 per cent), as against 948 (19.97 per cent) at the national level, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. These critical deficiencies in the enforcement apparatuses need urgent attention if the gains against the Maoists are to be consolidated further. The Maoists are down, but yet not out. The overall declining trend in Maoist violence and activity across the country needs to be contained with further security interventions with a sense of urgency, as the Maoists have shown incredible capacities for resurrection in the past, and retain substantial operational and overground capabilities in significant areas of their erstwhile regions of dominance. The SFs will have to overcome prevailing operational and capacity deficits, to prevent any rebel resurgence. | [Assessments Year

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with “unspecified casualties” on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi’s China and Modi’s India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China’s ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China’s abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India’s protest in denying Beijing’s claims as “exaggerated and untenable” is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi’s “clarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat”_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India’s active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China’s nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India’s nuclear strike range_** **_(right) – estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India’s national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China’s “containment of India,” the modernization of the PLA and its “growing assertiveness on the border”, and recommended a shift of India’s national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China’s unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or “string of pearls” that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India’s security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India’s peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China’s energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China’s power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China’s “Malacca dilemma,” by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing’s interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of “the quad”, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing’s ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India’s nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India’s boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India’s dismay. When BRI’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India’s doctrine of “strategic autonomy”. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek “equivalence” with the great powers — China, Russia, US — in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi’s party and support the base’s nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem “techno-nationalism”.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India’s dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India’s military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China’s relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. Commensurate to China’s 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a “peaceful rise” of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world’s longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India’s options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India’s strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India’s preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India’s “Neighborhood First” policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi’s ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal’s stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the “Asian Century” may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India’s geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide “chicken’s neck” connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China’s favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi’s strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India’s advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ”partners” with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh’s deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China’s border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its “like-minded partners” in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India’s diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war – for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India’s irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China’s assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-à-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, “wolf-warrior diplomacy”, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India – the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its “NORMS — New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System” approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India’s quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact – an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China – to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia – India’s soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter’s unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese “iron brother”, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China’s increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India’s disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled. In the _Art of War_, Sun Tzu posits, “a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.”\\[31\\] In their international positioning, whether it will be India or China’s thinking and preparedness that is victorious, only the real geopolitical battle will tell — one that far exceeds the LAC battlegrounds. * * * **References** [_**\\[1\\]**_](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/india-china-standoff-from-precarious-peace-to-the-point-of-no-return/?srsltid=AfmBOopMYRpkammY3JbuSv0VQLBVgNroFN1MwcBzigwT7ZYGZBeChO-Y#_ednref1) _Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas, New Delhi, November 29, 1996, United Nations Peacemaker, available from_( [https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%20IN\\_961129\\_Agreement%20between%20China%20and%20India.pdf](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%2520IN_961129_Agreement%2520between%2520China%2520and%2520India.pdf)).

Shah](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/kriti-m-shah) _The citizens’ right to protest is a pillar of Indian democracy. While citizens are allowed to peacefully assemble, however, protests and demonstrations sometimes take a violent turn; recent examples are the Jat protests in Haryana and the Kashmir unrest following the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, both in 2016. During such occasions, it is the prerogative of the Indian state to deal with the violent civil protests in a manner that ensures public order and protects citizens from harm. This paper discusses the use of force by security officials during periods of violent civil unrest and seeks to understand the ways and means of dealing with such protests in the country._ ## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

Today's spy doesn't wear a trench coat or sneak across borders — they slip into servers. A few lines of malicious code, a cleverly worded phishing email, and one careless click are enough to open a backdoor into power grids, defence networks, or corporate vaults. There's no gunfire, no alarm — just a silent invasion across cyberspace.Modern espionage no longer focuses on state secrets alone. It can paralyse ports, jam telecoms, empty bank accounts, and hold critical infrastructure hostage, all from thousands of miles away. Many of these attacks aren't random pranks but well-coordinated operations by advanced persistent threats (APTs) — hacker groups often backed by nation-states who monitor systems for months and even years — or by ‘Spider gangs', the global cybercrime cartels who chase profit, not politics.In Feb 2025, a hacker collective calling itself ‘Keymous+' targeted Gujarat's civic systems, according to FalconFeeds.io, a threat actor repository. The group overwhelmed the websites of Ahmedabad and Surat municipal corporations with fake web traffic in a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that crashed the portals for hours. Analysts found that Keymous+ boasted of 700 global attacks in 2025, 27.6% of which were govt entities while the rest ranged from finance and telecom to education. **You Can Also Check: [Ahmedabad AQI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-aqi-level-air-quality-index-today/3252) \\| [Weather in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-weather-forecast-today/380001) \\| [Gold Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/gold-rates-today/gold-price-in-ahemadabad) \\| [Silver Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/silver-rates-today/silver-price-in-ahemadabad)** But others aimed far deeper. In 2020, RedEcho, a group suspected to be backed by a nation-state, infiltrated India's power grid. They did not cause blackouts, but mapped out critical systems like the regional and state load despatch centres (RLDCs and SLDCs) — the nerve centres managing electricity supply — in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and several northern states. Cybersecurity experts at Recorded Future's Insikt group believe the hackers were creating digital \"backdoors\" — hidden entry points — \"to cause potential blackouts in the future\".Then came, TAG-38, another elite adversary sponsored by an enemy nation. Between Sep 2021 and March 2022, \"they targeted at least seven SLDCs in northern and western India, including areas near sensitive border zones\", states the Inskit group report. They cleverly hid their tracks by using hacked DVRs and IP cameras in Taiwan and South Korea to control their attacks remotely. These groups use advanced tools like ShadowPad (a modular malware that can be customised for different attacks) and remote access trojan (RAT) software that lets hackers control a computer from afar. They often get in through spear phishing — tricking someone into clicking a fake email link — or by exploiting weak spots in websites.India also faces threats from APT36 known as ‘Transparent Tribe', another group backed by an enemy nation and active since 2013. In March and April 2025, they disguised malware as updates on the ‘Pahalgam terror attack' to trick officials into opening infected files. They even created fake ministry of defence websites and used a sneaky trick called ClickFix, where malicious code is copied from a user's clipboard without them knowing.Meanwhile, SideCopy, another group, used fake social media profiles and phishing emails to target India's defence personnel. And APT41, also backed by an enemy nation, has been spying on India's healthcare and tech sectors, while also [hacking](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hacking) for money, even manipulating virtual currencies in online games.To combat such threats, Gujarat's science and technology department issued a circular this year, urging all govt employees to strengthen cyber hygiene. \"Do not share official photos or documents online, and never link work emails to personal apps,\" warned principal secretary Mona Kandhar. Officials were reminded that one careless click can compromise an entire department.The war is invisible, but it is already here. Every click, download, or forwarded file could be the entry point for a breach waiting to happen.

Pakistani hackers attacked 1.5 million-plus Indian websites after Operation Sindoor: Failure rate, names of 7 Pakistani hacker groups; techniques used and more [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Oct 13, 2025, 14:23 IST Share AA + **Text Size** - Small - Medium - Large Following the Pahalgam terror strike, Maharashtra Cyber identified seven APT groups, primarily Pakistan-allied, responsible for over 1.5 million cyber attacks targeting critical Indian infrastructure. While only 150 attacks succeeded, these groups employed malware, DDoS attacks, and misinformation campaigns. The attacks originated from Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Middle East, and Indonesia, with some successful defacements and alleged data theft. Representational AI image Maharashtra Cyber has reportedly identified seven Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups responsible for launching over 15 lakh cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure websites across India following the Pahalgam terror strike. Of these, only 150 attacks were successful, officials said, as per a report by news agency PTI. This means a failure rate of 99.99% or should one say abysmal success rate of 0.01%.In a report titled \"Road of Sindoor\", prepared under the military operation launched by the Indian armed forces under the same name against terrorists, the state's nodal cyber agency has detailed the cyber warfare launched by Pakistan-allied hacking groups. The report has been submitted to all key law enforcement agencies, including the Director General of Police and the State Intelligence Department.According to the report, these cyber attacks originated from Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Middle East, and an Indonesian group, said Yashasvi Yadav, Additional Director General of Police, Maharashtra Cyber. ## India-Pakistan Ceasefire has not stopped Pakistani hackers Even after India and Pakistan reached an understanding to stop military hostilities, Indian government websites are facing a barrage of cyber attacks from the neighbouring country as well as from Bangladesh and the Middle Eastern region, they said.\"The probe discovered that cyber attacks on (government websites in) India decreased after India-Pakistan ceased hostilities, but not fully stopped. These attacks continue from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Morocco, and Middle Eastern countries,\" he said.Pakistani hackers bringing down websites of major airports in India, Election Commission and ...Addressing reporters, a senior official of Maharashtra Cyber debunked claims of hackers stealing data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai, hacking aviation and municipal systems, and targeting the Election Commission website. ## Techniques used by Pakistani hackers The methods used by hackers included malware campaigns, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and GPS spoofing. The defacement of Indian websites was also reported. He said many such attacks were thwarted, and critical infrastructure of India was saved.The report also highlights a hybrid warfare strategy by Pakistan-allied groups that includes widespread misinformation campaigns. These groups falsely claimed to have hacked India's banking system and caused power outages. These false narratives included claims of cyber attacks on India's power grid, statewide blackouts, satellite jamming, disruption of the Northern Command, and an alleged attack on a BrahMos missile storage facility, Yadav said.Maharashtra Cyber identified and removed over 5,000 instances of misinformation and fake news related to India-Pakistan military conflicts that were circulating on social media. ## 7 Pakistani Hacker groups that attacked Indian websites The seven hacking groups identified in the report are APT 36 (Pakistan-based), Pakistan Cyber Force, Team Insane PK, Mysterious Bangladesh, Indo Hacks Sec, Cyber Group HOAX 1337, and National Cyber Crew (Pakistan-allied). These groups collectively launched approximately 1.5 million targeted cyber attacks on Indian infrastructure, Yadav said. ## The Indian websites Pakistani hackers brought down Among the 150 successful attacks, the Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council website was defaced. The attackers also claimed to have stolen data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), as well as from telecom companies, with some of the data allegedly appearing on the darknet. Additionally, the website of the Defence Nursing College in Jalandhar was defaced. **About the Author** [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) The TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

    "full_text": "Author : [Soumya Awasthi](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/soumya-awasthi) ###### [**Expert Speak**](https://www.orfonline.org/content-type/expert-speak) [Raisina Debates](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak-category/raisina-debates-review) ##### Published on **Oct 14, 2025** > _APT36’s targeting of India’s BOSS Linux system reveals the expanding scope of Pakistan’s cyber-espionage operations, underscoring the urgent need for India to strengthen its digital defence architecture._ Following Operation Sindoor, the Pakistan-linked threat group APT36, also known as Transparent Tribe, has [targeted India’s Bharat Operating System Solutions](https://sundayguardianlive.com/news/pakistan-linked-cyber-espionage-group-targets-indian-institutions-137611/) (BOSS) Linux [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/www.orfonline.org#_ftn1) operating system numerous times. This marks a significant departure from the group’s usual playbook, which has been centred on Windows-centric malware and spear-phishing lures. By expanding its reach to compromise BOSS Linux, a system widely adopted by Indian government entities, APT36 is signalling not merely a technical upgrade but a deliberate escalation on the cyber-espionage front in the India-Pakistan rivalry. APT36’s targeting of BOSS Linux indicates a calculated attempt to undermine confidence in this indigenous platform. A successful breach not only grants access to sensitive communications and classified data but also erodes institutional faith in self-reliant technological ecosystems. This outcome serves Pakistan’s interests on multiple levels: tactically, by harvesting intelligence; and strategically, by discrediting India’s efforts at digital autonomy. > By expanding its reach to compromise BOSS Linux, a system widely adopted by Indian government entities, APT36 is signalling not merely a technical upgrade but a deliberate escalation on the cyber-espionage front in the India-Pakistan rivalry. The discovery of this campaign underscores an uncomfortable reality: Pakistan-based cyber actors, often operating under the aegis of state agencies or enjoying tacit state protection, are evolving their capabilities beyond low-level phishing attacks into strategically targeted, cross-platform espionage operations. This trend holds profound implications for India’s national security, not least because it compromises trust in indigenous technologies developed as alternatives to foreign software ecosystems. ## Anatomy of the New Campaign The latest intrusion by APT36 begins with a familiar vector, spear-phishing emails. Camouflaged as official government correspondence, these emails deliver compressed archives containing malicious desktop files. Unlike traditional Windows executables, these shortcuts are designed explicitly for Linux environments and crafted to resemble innocuous PDF files. When executed, the desktop file triggers a [series of covert commands](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments) embedded in its Exec field. Utilities such as ‘curl’ and ‘xxd’ are then employed to fetch a hex-encoded payload from [attacker-controlled infrastructure](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments), decode it, and silently deploy it under the temporary directory. With execution rights granted, [the payload operates silently](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments) in the background, all while the user is distracted by a decoy PDF opened in parallel. > Forensic evidence suggests a Pakistan state-backed effort, given the substantial resources expended on developing BOSS Linux-specific attack chains and maintaining redundant infrastructure. The campaign is more than an opportunistic strike; it is an assault on India’s technological sovereignty. Persistence is achieved by ensuring that the [malware relaunches upon every login.](https://cloudsek.com/blog/investigation-report-apt36-malware-campaign-using-desktop-entry-files-and-google-drive-payload-delivery) Its communications are funnelled to command-and-control (C2) nodes and the newly registered domain, both of which reflect a carefully coordinated campaign. Forensic evidence suggests a Pakistan state-backed effort, given the substantial resources expended on developing [BOSS Linux-specific attack chains and maintaining redundant infrastructure](https://teamwin.in/apt36-hackers-attacking-indian-boss-linux-systems-with-weaponized-desktop-shortcut-files/#:~:text=The%20digital%20defense%20perimeter%20of,deliver%20and%20execute%20malicious%20payloads.). The campaign is more than an opportunistic strike; it is an assault on India’s technological sovereignty. ## Pakistan’s Cyber-Espionage Landscape [Pakistan-supported hacking groups](https://cyble.com/threat-actor-profiles/transparenttribe/) collectively serve Islamabad’s strategic agenda. [APT 36, also known as Transparent Tribe](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/apt-profile-transparent-tribe-aka-apt36/), is primarily focused on cyber espionage against the Indian government, targeting Indian defence personnel, diplomatic missions, and critical infrastructure. Its preferred tactics have included malware-laden documents, watering-hole attacks, and social engineering through fake recruitment portals. There have been reports of a [link between other APT-based groups](https://cybersrcc.com/2025/05/02/pakistan-linked-sidecopy-hackers-escalate-indian-cyberattacks-with-curlback-rat-and-spark-rat/#:~:text=SideCopy%20is%20a%20Pakistan%2Dlinked,and%20now%2C%20critical%20infrastructure%20sectors.), such as [SideCopy, SideWinder](https://cyble.com/threat-actor-profiles/transparenttribe/), and [TransparentTribe](https://socradar.io/dark-web-profile-apt36/). These groups often share infrastructure, malware families, or operational overlaps, suggesting either coordination or common direction by Pakistan’s intelligence services, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). ## A Global Nexus: Pakistan Supporting Hackers Beyond Borders While India remains the principal target, Pakistan-based hackers have extended their reach internationally, either independently or in collaboration with other state-linked actors. Several examples illustrate this global dimension. For instance, in 2021, soon after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, Pakistan-linked hackers engaged in a campaign [against Afghan government](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-says-hackers-from-pakistan-targeted-people-in-the-previous-afghan-government/article37537222.ece) and civil society networks, consolidating Islamabad’s influence and monitoring rival factions. Similarly, there have been reported overlaps between Pakistani hacker groups and [campaigns affecting Gulf states](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/saudi-arabia-uae-face-brunt-apt-cyber-attacks-middle-east-threatcop-gwecc/), particularly those hosting large Indian diasporas. Espionage here has dual value: monitoring Indian activities abroad and gaining leverage with Gulf governments. Security firms have observed occasional alignment between Pakistani actors and broader anti-Western cyber campaigns, some with tacit [Chinese or Iranian involvement](https://www.indiandefensenews.in/2025/06/chinas-support-for-pakistan-and-iran.html#:~:text=Tuesday%2C%20June%2017%2C%202025%20by,desire%20to%20counterbalance%20Western%20influence.). These collaborations may be opportunistic rather than formal. Still, they indicate a willingness on the part of Pakistani hackers to position themselves as part of the global anti-Western cyber-espionage ecosystem. > As India promotes platforms like BOSS Linux, there should be a mandatory and more rigorous security certification framework led by CERT-In, DRDO, and the National Informatics Centre (NIC). In essence, Pakistan has fostered an environment where state priorities, cybercrime networks, and ideological motivations blur into a hybrid threat matrix. The state benefits from plausible deniability while reaping the intelligence dividends of global cyber operations. ## **Evolution of Capabilities** Over the past decade, Pakistan-based hackers have evolved from low-level disruptors into sophisticated cyber-espionage actors. Between 2010 and 2014, their operations primarily involved [website defacements](https://www.idsa.in/publisher/issuebrief/digital-war-pakistans-cyber-activity-against-india), online propaganda, and basic [phishing attacks](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/apt36-a-phishing-campaign-targeting-indian-government-entities/#:~:text=An%20investigation%20into%20the%20domain%20revealed%20a%20notable%20connection%20to,targeting%20of%20Indian%20government%20entities.) aimed at embarrassing Indian institutions. From 2015 to 2019, groups like [APT36 matured technically](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/apt36-refines-tools-attacks-indian-targets#:~:text=APT36%20Refines%20Tools%20in%20Attacks%20on%20Indian%20Targets%20APT36%20Refines,Step%2Dby%2DStep%20Cyberattack%20Capability), shifting toward credential theft, malware infiltration, and sustained surveillance of India’s defence and diplomatic networks. The period 2020 to 2024 marked a cross-platform expansion, with Pakistan-linked actors [developing Android malware](https://therecord.media/android-malware-alleged-pakistan-espionage-campaign-india#:~:text=Android%20malware%20used%20in%20six,logs%20and%20delete%20all%20contacts.) targeting Indian military personnel through fake applications and deploying advanced Windows-based trojans with layered obfuscation. By 2025, the focus had moved to Linux-specific targeting, particularly against India’s indigenous BOSS Linux system. This development signals dedicated research capacity and a state-backed commitment to penetrating critical digital infrastructure. Such a trajectory reflects Pakistan’s transition from a nuisance-level cyber actor to a structured, strategic, and offensive one that directly threatens India’s technological and national security landscape. ## Strategic Implications for India The attack on India’s BOSS Linux should not be viewed as an isolated cyber incident but as part of a broader transnational security challenge unfolding in the grey zone of hybrid warfare. Pakistan’s strategy has long employed a blend of conventional, sub-conventional, and informational tools to weaken India’s security architecture, and cyber operations now represent its newest frontier. > Given that India has one of the most advanced IT ecosystems and that private Indian cybersecurity companies have been able to track cyberattacks — particularly those targeting defence technology, finance, and telecommunications — more swiftly, there is a need for greater synergy between private and government agencies. By targeting BOSS Linux, an indigenous operating system central to India’s drive for technological self-reliance, Pakistan-linked actors are staging an attack on India’s digital sovereignty. Beyond espionage, such operations enable adversaries to penetrate government systems on a large scale, intercepting sensitive policy, defence, and diplomatic communications that could influence decision-making during crises. In times of tension or limited conflict, pre-positioned malware could be activated to paralyse communication channels, interfere with logistics, or disrupt essential services, achieving strategic disruption without crossing the threshold of open war. In this sense, the targeting of BOSS Linux is symbolic of how the digital domain has become an extension of the battlefield, where state and proxy actors engage India in an unceasing contest for advantage in the grey zone. ## Defensive Priorities for India India must adopt a multi-layered, adaptive defence posture to counter the evolving threat landscape. 1. **_Mandate Indigenous Security Certification for Government Software_** **_:_** As India promotes platforms like BOSS Linux, there should be a mandatory and more rigorous security certification framework led by CERT-In, DRDO, and the National Informatics Centre (NIC). All open-source or indigenous software adopted by the government must undergo regular red-teaming, vulnerability audits, and penetration testing, with the results feeding into an early-warning repository. 2. **_Promote Public–Private Collaboration for Threat Intelligence Sharing_** **_:_** Given that India has one of the most advanced IT ecosystems and that private Indian cybersecurity companies have been able to track cyberattacks — particularly those targeting defence technology, finance, and telecommunications — more swiftly, there is a need for greater synergy between private and government agencies. Creating a secure national platform for the real-time exchange of threat data between government and industry would enhance situational awareness and facilitate early mitigation. 3. **_Create a ‘Trusted Digital Ecosystem’ Policy_** **_:_** Taking forward the country’s ‘Make in India’ mission, agencies overseeing the cybersecurity industry should promote a secure supply chain for hardware and software used in critical infrastructure. This includes regulating the import of networking equipment, mandating transparency in source code for government procurement, incentivising local cybersecurity start-ups, overcoming obstacles like No Cost, No Commitment (NCNC), and ensuring the start-ups do not migrate to Western countries. 4. **_Institutionalise Continuous Training and Capacity Building_** **_:_** A national programme for “Cybersecurity Literacy and Leadership” should be created for civil servants, military officers, and policymakers. 5. **_Develop a Strategic Cyber Deterrence Doctrine_** **_:_** India should articulate a formal doctrine defining how cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, government systems, or defence networks would be interpreted under national security law. Establishing clear thresholds for proportional responses — whether diplomatic, economic, or cyber-retaliatory — can serve as a deterrent to persistent actors like APT36. 6. **_Establish a National Cyber Command_** **_:_** Cyber threats should be treated not merely as technical incidents but as instruments of hybrid warfare. Therefore, the government and military must upgrade the Defence Cyber Agency to a Command-level body and formulate a holistic mechanism for securing national cyberspace. ## Conclusion The exploitation of BOSS Linux by APT36 is not merely a technical episode, but a strategic signal: Pakistan’s cyber-espionage machinery is adapting to India’s countermeasures and targeting indigenous solutions once thought secure. Transparent Tribe’s evolution from Windows payloads to Linux-specific malware reveals an expanding toolkit designed to penetrate India’s technological backbone. > The government and military must upgrade the Defence Cyber Agency to a Command-level body and formulate a holistic mechanism for securing national cyberspace. Pakistan’s broader cyber ecosystem, supported by state patronage and interwoven with global hacker networks, poses a persistent threat to India’s national security. For New Delhi, the challenge is not only to neutralise these campaigns but also to reinforce trust in indigenous systems and project resilience. Cyber warfare, unlike conventional conflict, unfolds silently yet relentlessly. In this theatre, the battle is as much about perceptions of security as it is about technical breaches. India’s defensive strategy must therefore be holistic, encompassing technological, institutional, and diplomatic aspects, to ensure that its sovereignty in cyberspace remains uncompromised. **_Soumya Awasthi_** _is a Fellow with the Centre for Security, Strategy and Technology at the Observer Research Foundation._ [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/www.orfonline.org#_ftnref1) BOSS Linux is a free, Indian operating system based on Linux, created by the government to promote open-source software and offer a secure system tailored for India's needs.

The two main actors that constitute the best hope for global growth are obviously India and China. Of the two, India is in many ways the better bet. The country’s ‘bottom-up’ economic model (enabling it to better withstand systemic shocks), its demographic composition and its democratic system provide it with a future outlook that is brighter than China’s. Also, it is impressive that, despite endemic corruption, poor infrastructure, and a currently weak and directionless Congress Party-dominated government, India’s economy maintains a growth rate of 6%. Moving into an era of multipolarity, the importance of enhancing ties with a rising power like India is of great strategic importance for the West. At the same time, though, India is facing internal security pressures, albeit largely unknown to many investors and policy makers. Large swaths of Indian territory are plagued by conflict between the state and the long-running Maoist insurgency group known as the Naxalites. If not dealt with effectively, the Naxalites might prove to be too much for New Delhi and turn out to be India’s Achilles heel imperiling its phenomenal global rise. The current manifestation of Maoist-inspired violence in India can be traced back to the period immediately following the country’s independence in 1948. The term Naxal or Naxalite is derived from the Indian village of Naxalbari (West Bengal) where the movement has its roots. The stated goal of the Naxalites was, and remains to this day, to free the poor from the clutches of the landlords, to implement land reforms and destroy the oppressive feudal order in India. A central part their strategy to achieve this goal has been a guerrilla war against government forces in the underdeveloped rural and tribal regions of India. Although the nature of the movement makes it difficult to estimate the group’s size, recent estimates by The Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence service, have placed the numerical strength of the Naxalites at some 20,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. These numbers would suggest that the Naxalites are almost twice as big as the FARC movement in Columbia, which numbered around 11,000 operatives in 2009. The Naxalites’ organizational structure includes an elaborate hierarchy with a Central Committee at the top, followed by Regional Bureaus, Zonal or State Committees, and District or Division Committees. Following a period of internal strife and fractional splits, in 2004 the a merger occurred to create an umbrella organizational structure for the Naxalite insurgency. This reunification was followed by an upswing in the level of violence. Like all successful or enduring insurgent groups, the Naxalites follow a two-tiered strategy, using violence against their opponents as well as engaging in socio-economic initiatives to win the support of the population. With regard to the latter, it is important to note that the Naxalite insurgency puts much effort into addressing the grievances of the marginalised poor, who are disappointed in – or even hostile towards – the Indian government. For instance, Naxalite fighters have campaigned for women’s rights, have tried to improve the housing situation of those in need, have organised railway strikes, and have run irrigation projects to help farmers increase their harvests. The violent actions that make up the other second pillar of he Naxalite strategy are mostly aimed against the police, Indian government officials and transnational corporations. These attacks are intended to shield the population from capitalist influence. The Naxalites are quite successful in this regard, as the group has managed to take control of certain regions, especially in the Red Corridor, where state power has been eroded or has collapsed altogether. Several factors account for the Naxalites’ ability to pull off tours de force of this kind. First, the manpower that the Indian insurgents brings to bear, gives them the organisational clout needed to wage a large-scale campaign. Second, although the Naxalites are geographically dispersed and not centrally led, the group shows a remarkable commitment to the overall strategy. Although the group’s operatives occasionally lash out at the local population, Naxalite actions generally fit the ambition to create Naxalite-controlled areas to encircle the cities and eventually take over the country. The third explanation of the insurgency’s sustainability is the fact that many Naxalite operatives are active in their native areas. From this, they derive knowledge of the terrain, crucial in irregular warfare, as well as familiarity with the local population and its plight, which makes it unlikely that they will be perceived as interlopers. Another factor that makes it unlikely that the Naxalite insurgency will soon be a thing of the past is the inadequacy of the Indian government’s response. While it is clear that discrimination and poverty of the rural population provide the Naxalites with a support base and a pool of potential recruits, the government’s measures to alleviate the living conditions of the rural poor are generally half-hearted and poorly implemented. Rather, the government tries to quell the insurgency by taking a hard approach with a central role for law enforcement agencies. Thus far however, this hard line has not yielded the desired results. The number of police forces deployed against the Naxalites was recently increased to 76,000, but the insurgency is still alive and kicking. And even regardless of the effectiveness of the government line, it remains to be seen whether it is sustainable. India is one of the most underpoliced countries in the world, and there is little chance that the government will deploy the army, reluctant as it is to start a long and messy campaign and to take forces away from Jammu and Kashmir. It appears that the Naxalites are here to stay. All too often, analyses of India are based on the assumption that its rise is inevitable and effortless. For a long time, the western view was that the rest of the world held little allure to the west, but now, the received wisdom on India at business and international relations conferences is an overcompensation of earlier neglect and underestimation. This overly sunny view is as misguided as the prior arrogance. What is needed is a sober analysis of India’s economy and internal security situation. The goal of this article has certainly not been to denigrate the future potential of India or to engage in fear mongering. Rather, we have tried to draw attention to an important actor on the Indian scene that until now has received only minimal international attention. Adding this dimension to current thinking about India will allow investors and policy makers to make informed decisions on when, how and where to invest their money in India. If India is serious about defeating the Naxalites, they will need to deal with the root causes of the group’s appeal in the Red Corridor, which will require addressing poverty, corruption and tribal inclusion issues. Only by doing so can India retain the domestic stability that is a prerequisite for its continued phenomenal rise. ### About The Author ## Article Discussion: ![Small Wars Journal by Arizona State University](https://smallwarsjournal.com/wp-content/themes/swj/images/logo_icon.svg) ### Become a Member To Engage!

    "full_text": "### BW Communities # India Faces Highest Ransomware Threat In APJ Region: CrowdStrike Report [BW Online Bureau](javascript:void(0);) Oct 21, 2025 - [\\# Ransomware](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/ransomware) - [\\# India](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/india) - [\\# Cyberattack](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/cyberattack) - [\\# Cybersecurity](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/cybersecurity) - [\\# APJ](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/apj) Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively.

Ashley, ‘How the Spectre of Hindutva Captured Politics in Kerala,’ The Wire, 30 October 2020](https://thewire.in/politics/kerala-elections-hindutva-muslims) The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. ## Document Type Book ## Publication Date 10-2016 ## Publisher National Defense University Press ## City Washington, DC ## Recommended Citation Lynch, Thomas F.

Currently, around 50 GW of renewable energy capacity remains stranded across India due to transmission bottlenecks, resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. India needs a comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap that incorporates cluster-level demand forecasting to anticipate emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs. Given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, India must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. Over the past decade, India has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy (RE), ranking third behind China and the US in installations and power generation. More than 71% of India's total installed renewable energy capacity, which stands at approximately [247 gigawatt (GW),](https://mnre.gov.in/en/physical-progress/) comes from solar and wind installations. This surge in clean energy generation, particularly from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources like solar and wind, is prompting a paradigm shift in power transmission dynamics. Power transmission is a critical component of the electricity value chain, and a robust and resilient network is essential for integrating the increasing RE capacity into the grid. Historically, India's power transmission network has been among the most advanced in the world, characterised by proactive planning and upgrades that have resulted in minimal congestion and strong operational performance. However, the significantly shorter gestation periods of VRE installations have left the transmission network struggling to keep pace with RE deployment. The result is a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of energy evacuation infrastructure. The diurnal and seasonal variability of VRE further complicates transmission planning, leading to stranded RE assets and underutilisation of transmission infrastructure. Currently, [around 50 GW of RE capacity is stranded across India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/indias-stranded-renewable-projects-double-to-over-50-gw-industry-documents-show/articleshow/123042172.cms?from=mdr), resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. The rising complications in VRE evacuation and its integration into the power transmission network have prompted power regulators to ramp up their transmission planning efforts. In September 2025, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) Chairperson Ghanshyam Prasad [reaffirmed](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/cea-revises-transmission-plans-every-six-months-for-600-gw-renewables-integration/124114939) the goal of integrating 600 GW of renewables into India’s power grid by 2032. He noted that to ensure seamless integration, the CEA has shifted to potential-based planning, adding that the plans will be revised every six months to reflect continuously evolving ground realities. Monthly meetings are also being held to expedite investment planning and prevent delays in approvals and execution. **Obstacles to an efficient power transmission system** Turning the increased planning efforts into actual implementation will require addressing the persistent challenges that hinder the development of green power transmission, like difficulties in land acquisition for right of way, and overseas transmission equipment procurement constraints, among other issues. Also, state-specific issues—such as Rajasthan's great Indian bustard (GIB) case concerning the critically endangered bird’s deaths from collisions with overhead power lines—further demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of delays that transmission network expansion can face, stretching gestation periods of transmission projects further vis-à-vis solar and wind. Rajasthan, in particular, is grappling with significant transmission bottlenecks, making it a hotspot of stranded RE assets. The primary reasons for this include delayed commissioning of transmission infrastructure, technical and ecological hurdles, and speculative grid access. As of July 2025, around 8 GW out of Rajasthan's 22 GW of operational inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected RE projects remained stranded. Additionally, these projects also faced generation curtailment of roughly 3.8 GW in the same month. These issues underscore the broader problem of rapidly developing geographically concentrated RE capacity without adequate planning and growth of evacuation infrastructure. The [Rajasthan government’s proposal](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/government-to-establish-2k-mwh-battery-storage-plant-for-solar-power/124316705?utm_source=top_news&utm_medium=sectionListing) this year to establish 2,000 megawatt-hour(MWh) of grid-scale battery energy storage aims to mitigate RE power curtailments and improve state grid utilisation. **The need for a strategic roadmap** A comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap is essential to ensure that Rajasthan and other RE-rich states can sustainably integrate future RE capacity additions. This roadmap should be target-oriented and timeline-bound with clearly specified deadlines and associated penalties. It should incorporate cluster-level demand forecasting by coordinating with state IT, industry, and urban development agencies to identify emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle charging (EV) hubs. Moreover, given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, the roadmap must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. The roadmap should also recognise the importance of energy storage systems (ESS). Critical in power generation and distribution, ESSs will also play a vital role in the green power transmission sector. At key transmission nodes, storage systems can provide valuable ancillary services such as frequency regulation, voltage stability, congestion management, and black start capabilities. The roadmap must incorporate and clearly specify the state-wise transmission-focused energy storage requirements. India’s power transmission sector is highly concentrated and averse to foreign and private sector investment. Encouraging participation and fostering an investor-friendly climate will be essential to build the requisite transmission capacity organically. Transmission planning and operations must leverage advanced forecasting, load-flow modelling, and real-time monitoring to enhance predictability and operational efficiency. Additionally, there is a need to move beyond conventional power purchase agreement (PPA) or merit-order based dispatch systems and transition to a security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) model. SCED optimises real-time generation schedules by accounting for constraints such as transmission limits, generator ramp rates, and reserve requirements. Ultimately, a modern and robust transmission network will form the invisible backbone of India’s power sector, one that is flexible, resilient, and fully aligned with the country’s long-term decarbonisation goals.

    "full_text": "The near-term threat of severe escalation between India and Pakistan has waned, but ceasefire violations remain possible and, over the long term, disagreements on water-sharing and third-party mediation in Kashmir will sustain tensions and the risk of cross-border flare-ups. Late on May 12, India and Pakistan's directors general of military operations spoke by phone, days after India and Pakistan on May 10 agreed to a ceasefire after coming close to full-blown conflict. The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about. However, the announcement came just hours after cross-border attacks had sharply escalated, with India reportedly striking several Pakistani airbases, including one near Islamabad, to which Pakistan responded by reportedly hitting two...",

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(ANNIRUDHA MOOKERJEE/AFP/Getty Images) For more than two months, Chinese and Indian forces have stood toe to toe on the Doklam Plateau. The standoff is just the latest manifestation of a border dispute that began long before Chinese soldiers tried to extend a road through the contested region June 16 -- and one that extends well past the area in question. Along the thousands of kilometers of sinuous border between China and India lie three main points of contention: Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The regions are the most likely sites of a military confrontation between China and India, and each presents its own set of strategic considerations....

(AHMAD SAHEL ARMAN/AFP via Getty Images) By improving ties with the Taliban, India is seeking to reduce security risks, counterbalance Pakistan’s influence and improve economic opportunities in Afghanistan. But this strategy is likely to achieve only modest results because of Afghanistan’s fragile economic and security environment, as well as New Delhi’s enduring ideological and cultural differences with the Taliban. Indian officials recently visited Afghanistan for the first time since the Taliban took control of the country last year. A delegation led by J.P. Singh -- a secretary overseeing India’s external affairs with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran -- traveled to Kabul on June 6 to discuss the delivery of humanitarian aid with Taliban leaders. With the exception of sending such aid and indirectly contacting Afghanistan through third countries, New Delhi had not established a formal dialogue with Kabul since the Taliban seized power in August 2021.

The report on international religious freedom released on Wednesday said that in 2023, senior U.S. officials continued to \"raise concerns about religious freedom issues\" with their Indian counterparts. Human rights experts say India has seen a rise in attacks on minorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently won a third term, and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \"In India, we see a concerning increase in anti-conversion laws, hate speech, demolitions of homes and places of worship for members of minority faith communities,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, opens new tab when the report was released, in a rare direct rebuke of India. Criticism of India by the U.S. is usually restrained due to close economic ties and New Delhi's importance for Washington to counter China, political analysts say. The U.S. report listed dozens of incidents. Among them was a fatal shooting of a security official and three Muslims on a train near Mumbai by a suspect who was a railway security official. A probe by Indian authorities into that case is ongoing and the suspect was in jail, according to the Indian Express newspaper. The report cited examples of attacks against Muslims based on allegations that Muslim men were participating in the slaughter of cows or beef trading. The Indian embassy in Washington had no immediate comment. The Indian government denies discriminating against minorities, and says its welfare policies - like food subsidy schemes and electrification drives - aim to benefit all Indians. Rights advocates contest that and point to anti-Muslim hate speeches, opens new tab, the revoking, opens new tab of Muslim-majority Kashmir's special status, a citizenship law, opens new tab that the U.N. calls \"fundamentally discriminatory\" and the demolition of Muslim properties, opens new tab in the name of removing illegal construction. The State Department report also cited violence in the northeastern state of Manipur that started in May last year between minority, mostly Christian, Kuki and majority, mostly Hindu, Meitei ethnic groups. Hindu and Christian places of worship were destroyed in Manipur. Citing a local tribal leaders' forum, the report said over 250 churches were burnt down, more than 200 people were killed and over 60,000 were displaced. Hindus make up about 80% of India's 1.4 billion population. Muslims include 14% and Christians over 2%.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

    "full_text": "1 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 COUNTRY UPDATE: I UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 October 2024 By Sema Hasan, Senior Policy Analyst Increasing Abuses against Religious Minorities in India Introduction Religious freedom conditions in India have continued to worsen throughout 2024, particularly in the months prior to and immediately following the country’s national elections. In addition to the enforcement of discriminatory state-level legislation and propagation of hateful rhetoric, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government made a concerted effort to implement election promises that negatively and disproportionately impacted religious minorities and their ability to practice their faith. Such promises included enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), inaugurating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and introducing a national code to replace religion-specific personal laws. Each action was justified by government officials as necessary to protect India’s “cultural [and] linguistic heritage”—a common euphemism for Hindu supremacy, often at the expense of religious minorities. This report provides an overview of the various religious freedom violations that have taken place in India during 2024. It focuses on changes to the country’s legal framework, including the strengthening of discriminatory legislation like state-level anti-conversion and anti-terrorism laws, as well as the implementation of the CAA and the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). It also examines the increasing frequency of attacks against religious minorities and their advocates, including the targeting of places of worship. Laws and Other Challenges to Religious Freedom at the National Level The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) In May 2024, the Indian government published the rules for implementing the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), fulfilling a long-anticipated BJP campaign promise. Amending the country’s 1955 Citizenship Act, the CAA established a religious criterion for fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants (from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, or Christian communities) fleeing neighboring Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The law excludes Muslim refugees, including Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka. The act states that an individual must have lived or worked in India prior to December 31, 2014, in order to apply for citizenship. www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov Stephen Schneck Chair Eric Ueland Vice Chair Commissioners Mohamed Elsanousi Maureen Ferguson Susie Gelman Vicky Hartzler Asif Mahmood Meir Soloveichik Erin D. Singshinsuk Executive Director USCIRF’s Mission To advance international freedom of religion or belief, by independently assessing and unflinchingly confronting threats to this fundamental right. 2 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Critics argue that the CAA violates the Indian constitution’s principles prohibiting religious discrimination and its guarantees of equal protection under the law. Mass protests followed the initial announcement in 2019, in which hundreds were injured and thousands arrested—some of whom remained in detention as of September 2024, including Umar Khalid, Meeran Haider, and Sharjeel Imam. The recent announcement of the implementation rules initiated a surge of new protests as well as a number of petitions challenging the CAA before the Supreme Court. Several Indian states have expressed opposition to the CAA. In 2019, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh all moved resolutions against the CAA. In February 2024, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu stressed that he would not allow implementation of the CAA in that state, as he would “stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan brethren.” Similarly, in March, the chief minister of West Bengal voiced her opposition to the act, arguing that it would be used to “turn legal citizens into foreigners.” Kerala was the first state to legally challenge the CAA and in March renewed its 2020 plea before the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the law’s classification based on religion and country is discriminatory. In June, the Madhya Pradesh government granted Indian citizenship to three applicants under the CAA. National Register of Citizens (NRC) Human rights advocates argue that the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in combination with the CAA, would allow the Indian government to expel those it deemed noncitizens, posing particular risk to the country’s Muslim population. The government first piloted the NRC in Assam in 2018, when it sought to separate Indian citizens from “undocumented immigrants” living in that state. The NRC requires residents to prove they or their ancestors had entered Assam prior to March 24, 1971, or face exclusion from the register. In 2019, the Assam government published its list of names of those it considered Indian citizens according to the NRC, omitting 1.9 million names. Of these 1.9 million, an estimated 700,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Bengali Hindus, and 200,000 were from the Assamese Hindu groups Koch-Rajbongshi, Das, Kalita, and Sarma. In July 2024, the Assam government ordered police to cease referring people entitled to Indian citizenship— under the CAA—to Foreigners’ Tribunals, which function as quasi-judicial bodies that authorities task with determining whether an individual is a “suspected foreigner.” Despite this order, police in Assam that same month, in conjunction with the Foreigners’ Tribunals, declared 28 Muslims as “non-citizens” and sent them to a deportation center. In September, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that all individuals must submit an NRC application in order to receive identity cards. New Delhi India USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 3 Expropriation and Demolition of Places of Worship and Muslim Property Since the beginning of 2024, Indian authorities have facilitated the expropriation of places of worship, including the construction of Hindu temples on the sites of mosques. Most notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in January, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Indian authorities had constructed the temple atop the ruins of the Babri Masjid, which a Hindu mob had demolished in 1992 in their belief that it marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site was long contested; India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the mosque’s destruction was an “egregious violation” of the law and yet granted the site to Hindus while offering Muslims a separate plot of land to construct a new mosque—which remains unbuilt as of September 2024. The days following the temple’s January 2024 consecration were marked by a series of attacks and other instances of intolerance against religious minorities across six states. In each instance, violence erupted following Hindu nationalist processions through predominantly Muslim neighbors. In Maharashtra, violence broke out along Mira Road, where police stood by as mobs vandalized dozens of Muslim-owned shops. Several reports indicate that the police arrested Muslim youths, despite receiving dozens of complaints against the actions of the Hindu mob. In the aftermath of the Mira Road violence, municipal authorities returned with bulldozers to demolish structures they deemed illegal. Commonly referred to as “bulldozer justice,” state authorities have repeatedly used bulldozers to demolish Muslim property under the guise of removing “illegal” structures, including homes, businesses, and places of worship. In February, for example, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the 600-year-old Akhoondji Mosque, alleging that the building was an illegal encroachment. The mosque’s imam argued that he did not receive written notice before the demolition. The DDA has also announced its intention to demolish 20 religious structures in the forested areas of Sanjay Van, including 16 Muslim shrines. A court order claimed that Delhi “already had sufficient dargahs and temples” and that the forest needed restoration. The same month, in Uttarakhand, the demolition of a mosque and Muslim seminary by police and government officials sparked deadly clashes and an internet shutdown. In July, the DDA demolished the Faizyab Mosque and Madrassa in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area. Places of Worship Act Beyond demolitions, the government has expropriated several mosques for alternative purposes, directly violating India’s Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. The 1991 act froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed in August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith. While the act does not apply to the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, it extends protection to all other places of worship. Despite this law, an Indian court ruled in February that Hindus can worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, which Hindus claim rests on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The same month, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav called for the repeal of the Places of Worship Act, calling it “unconstitutional.” Waqf Amendment Bill In addition, many Muslims have expressed concern regarding the Indian government’s introduction of the Waqf Amendment Bill in August, which seeks to repeal the 1995 Waqf Act. A waqf is an endowment (movable or immovable) that Muslims can give for a specific pious or charitable purpose, according to Islamic tradition. Once registered as a waqf, such property—which may include land, graveyards, or buildings—is deemed nontransferable and held in perpetuity as such. All mosques in India are considered waqf properties, under the management of Muslim bodies in every state, known as Waqf Boards. The 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to broaden the government’s regulatory authority over these endowments and proposes the mandatory inclusion of non-Muslim members on Waqf Boards. It also seeks to prohibit the designation of a given property as a waqf based on its owner’s oral declaration alone. Legal experts and Muslim leaders argue that these provisions would erode their community’s autonomy over its own religious institutions. The introduction of this legislation follows the increased proliferation of disinformation regarding the distribution of wealth among India’s Muslim communities, including derogatory comments that Prime Minister Modi made during the national election. 4 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 State and Local Laws Impacting Religious Minorities Uniform Civil Code and Personal Status Laws Since 2019, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have articulated their intention to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to overrule existing personal laws that are highly integrated with religious beliefs. Such personal laws include areas such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession. Critics argue that a UCC would contradict secular principles while failing to adequately represent the needs and values of the country’s myriad and diverse religious communities. In February, the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand passed a state-level UCC bill, establishing a uniform set of rules on personal status law that includes marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. This bill is widely considered to represent a template for other states to adopt. The UCC sets the minimum age for marriage at 18. While Hindu and secular laws set age restrictions for men and women, there are no such limitations for Muslims and other communities. Some Muslim communities have characterized the UCC as a threat to Islamic practices, preferring to observe Shari’a as the basis for personal law, and some Sikh organizations have similarly rejected it, arguing that it “undermines Sikh identity.” The UCC further requires “live-in” relationships to be registered within a month and establishes criminal punishments, including six months in jail, for failing to do so. Such provisions would allow for further policing of interfaith couples, who already face risks including threats of violence from family members. In July, for example, the Uttarakhand high court directed police to provide protection to an interfaith couple in a live-in relationship and instructed them to register under the UCC. The couple reported receiving threats from their parents about their relationship. Anti-Conversion Laws In addition to the UCC and other legislation, authorities frequently used state-level policies throughout the first part of 2024, including anti-conversion laws, to target religious minorities across India. As USCIRF previously reported, 12 of India’s 28 states currently maintain anti\u0002conversion laws and enforce them to varying degrees. These laws prohibit conversion under circumstances that far exceed cases of coercion, and they are often punishable by hefty fines and prison terms. Authorities frequently enforce such laws under the pretext of preventing so-called “love jihad”—a conspiracy theory that claims Muslim men target and seduce Hindu women for conversion to Islam—while in effect targeting interfaith relationships. Since the beginning of the year, authorities have arrested dozens of Christians on allegations of conducting or participating in forced conversions. In June, for example, police in Uttar Pradesh detained 13 Christians, including four pastors; in July, seven Christians faced accusations of violating the state’s anti-conversion law in two separate incidents. That same month, government officials from Uttar Pradesh tabled a bill that would strengthen the state’s anti-conversion law, including expanding the punishment for conversion to life imprisonment, allowing anyone to file a First Instance Report (FIR) against suspected violators, and making religious conversion a nonbailable offense. Several other states made similar efforts to introduce or strengthen existing anti-conversion laws. In February, for example, the state of Chhattisgarh announced it would introduce legislation to address “illegal conversion,” claiming that Christian pastors had forcibly converted Hindus. In February, the Assam government passed the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Bill, which bans individuals or groups from performing “non\u0002scientific” healing, such as prayer, to treat illnesses. The chief minister of Assam further noted his intention to restrict Christian evangelism and conversion in the state with the bill. In April, the government of Gujarat issued a circular mandating that Hindus wishing to convert to Buddhism, Sikhism, or Jainism obtain approval from their district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. In June, the BJP-led government in Rajasthan withdrew its 2008 anti-conversion law in favor of new legislation aimed at “curbing alleged cases of ‘love jihad’” and religious conversion. Additionally, as of August, appeals challenging the constitutionality of anti\u0002conversion laws were pending in seven states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Anti-Cow Slaughter Laws India’s constitution directs states to take steps to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, considered sacred in Hinduism. As a result, 20 of India’s 28 states currently enforce anti-cow slaughter laws. Vigilante groups and self-proclaimed “cow protectors” frequently exploit such laws to target religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits. USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 5 An estimated dozen attacks involving “cow vigilantism” took place following India’s national elections in June. In August, for example, a group of cow vigilantes beat a Muslim migrant worker to death, falsely accusing him of having eaten beef. A day later, a group of Hindu men violently attacked a 72-year-old Muslim man because they believed he was carrying beef in his bag. The same month, a group of “cow protectors” shot and killed a 19-year-old Hindu student because they thought he was a Muslim smuggling cows. While arrests were made in each of these cases, perpetrators of such attacks often operate with impunity; they rarely face punishment and are often released on bail within 24 hours. Other Significant Religious Freedom Challenges across India Hate Speech, Misinformation and Disinformation In the leadup to the June 2024 elections, political officials increasingly wielded hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims and other religious minorities. Prime Minister Modi repeatedly claimed that the opposition party would “wipe out [the] Hindu faith from the country” and had plans to make Hindus “second class citizens in their own country.” He perpetuated hateful stereotypes about Muslims, referring to them as “infiltrators.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah echoed these statements and insisted falsely that opposition leaders would impose Shari’a if elected—despite the fact that the opposition election manifesto included no mention of Shari’a or Muslims. Additionally, misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech by Indian government officials frequently fuel and incite cow vigilantism and other attacks against religious minorities. The attacks against Muslims in Mira Road following the inauguration of the Ram Temple in January, for example, erupted following inflammatory speeches by two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain. Rane reportedly openly threatened the Muslim community, using offensive language and urging the Hindu community to “ignite and retaliate.” While First Instance Reports (FIRs) were filed against Rane and Jain, Mumbai police argued in July that the use of terms like “jihadis,” “Rohingya,” and “Bangladeshis” were not aimed at the Muslim community and therefore did not fall under Section 295A of the penal code. The same month, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about an increase in hate speech targeting Rohingya refugees and the Indian government’s role in arbitrary mass detention and forcible return of that community to Burma. Following Rane and Jain’s speeches, BJP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) T. Raja Singh gave a 40-minute speech in February stoking religious tensions, in which he openly called for violence against Muslims and for the further demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura. Singh claimed that Muslims were facilitating the forceful conversion of Hindus and repeatedly referred to Rohingya and Bangladeshi Muslims as “illegal.” He encouraged his audience to be “prepared to fight for the protection of our country and religion” and to fight against “love jihad,” forced conversion, and cow slaughter. Attacks against Religious Minorities In March, a group of UN experts raised alarm about the level of violence and hate crimes against religious minorities in the leadup to national elections, including vigilante violence, targeted and arbitrary killings, demolition of property, and harassment. They called on the Indian government to fulfill its obligation to prohibit religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and violence. From January to March 161 incidents of violence against Christians in India were reported—47 of which occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh. Such incidents ranged from violent attacks on churches and prayer meetings to physical assaults, harassment, and false allegations of forced conversion. Muslims continued to be targeted, as well. In March, a group of Hindus in Gujarat violently attacked foreign Muslim university students as they gathered for prayer during Ramadan. The university subsequently issued new guidelines, instructing students not to pray in common spaces. Moreover, following the election results, during which the BJP lost its national majority, at least 28 attacks against Muslims occurred from June to August. Religious educational institutions were also subjected to harassment and targeting. In February, for example, Hindu organizations entered a Catholic school in Assam and demanded instructors cease using Christian images and symbols. In March, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment striking down a previous ruling on the governance of madrasas, effectively banning Islamic schools in that state and ordering the public school enrollment of students whom the closures had impacted. 6 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Crackdown on Civil Society and Faith-Based Organizations In 2024 the government of India has expanded its tactics of repression to target religious minorities and their advocates abroad. Journalists, academics, and civil society organizations documenting India’s religious freedom violations have reported facing denial of consular services, including the revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards as well as threats of violence and surveillance. In April, international reporting linked an official in India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to the 2023 assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist in New York. Additionally, Indian authorities have repeatedly used discriminatory legislation to target religious communities and those advocating on their behalf. Authorities continued to exploit antiterror and financing laws, including the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to crack down on civil society organizations, religious minorities, human rights defenders, and journalists reporting on religious freedom. The UAPA was enacted in 1967 but amended in 2019, allowing the government to designate individuals as “terrorists” without due process. The law vaguely defines “unlawful activity” as any action “intended to disrupt India’s sovereignty, integrity or security,” including “disruptive speech.” In 2024, several religious minorities and human rights activists have continued to face detention without trial under the UAPA, including Hany Babu and Rona Wilson. Academic and human rights activist GN Saibaba, whom authorities detained under the UAPA in 2017 for criticizing state violence against religious minorities, was ultimately released in March but described how police had abused him, tortured him, and denied him medical care while in custody. Similarly, organizations that document and advocate for religious freedom continue to face harassment and, in some cases, are forced to shut down operations. Like the UAPA, authorities have used India’s Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to obstruct the work of civil society organizations. FCRA regulates access to foreign funds for individuals and organizations and prohibits receipt of foreign funds for “any activities [deemed] detrimental to the national interest” of India. The law requires nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to apply for FCRA licenses to received foreign funding, but authorities can readily revoke such licenses. In April, India’s Home Ministry canceled the FCRA licenses of five NGOs, preventing them from using existing funds. Those NGOs included the Church of North India (CNI) Synodical Board of Social Service, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, and Evangelical Fellowship of India. In total, the Indian government has canceled over 20,000 FCRA registrations since 2012. Replacing India’s Criminal Code In July, the Indian government moved to replace its colonial-era criminal laws with three new laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA). These laws replaced the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1872 Indian Evidence Act, respectively. Human rights groups argue that the enforcement of these new laws may have exacerbated the targeting of religious minorities and their advocates. Such legislation may pose an additional threat to freedom of expression, association, and right to a free trial, particularly for religious minorities. The BNS specifically adds a new provision criminalizing “acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India” and increases the minimum punishment from three years to seven. It also expands the criminalization of the promotion of “enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion” to include electronic communications. Reporting indicates that this provision has already served as a pretext for targeting journalists who reported on an alleged mob lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh. The BNSS additionally allows for police to seek 15-day detention of an accused individual at any time before they have completed 40–60 days of the allowed remand period. UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief. Professional Staff Michael Ardovino Policy Analyst Susan Bishai Senior Policy Analyst Mollie Blum Policy Analyst Guillermo Cantor Director of Research and Policy Elizabeth K. Cassidy Senior Strategic Advisor Mingzhi Chen Supervisory Policy Advisor Patrick Greenwalt Policy Analyst Sema Hasan Senior Policy Analyst Thomas Kraemer Chief Administrative Officer Veronica McCarthy Public Affairs Associate Hilary Miller Policy Analyst Nora Morton Operations Specialist Dylan Schexnaydre Policy Analyst Scott Weiner Supervisory Policy Analyst Luke Wilson International Legal Specialist Kurt Werthmuller Deputy Director of Research and Policy Nathan Wineinger Chief of Public Affairs Jean Wu Policy Analyst Conclusion Religious freedom conditions in India continue to follow a deteriorating and concerning trajectory. The Indian government continues to repress and restrict religious communities through the enforcement of discriminatory legislation like anti-conversion laws, cow slaughter laws, and antiterrorism laws. In doing so, authorities have arbitrarily detained individuals highlighting violations of religious freedom, including religious leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, without due process—in some cases for years. Indian officials have repeatedly employed hateful and derogatory rhetoric and misinformation to perpetuate false narratives about religious minorities, inciting widespread violence, lynchings, and demolition of places of worship. In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in particularly severe religious freedom violations. This report further outlines a number of policy recommendations that the U.S. government can take to address religious freedom violations in India, including issuing targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, conditioning arms sales based on improved religious freedom conditions, and incorporating religious freedom priorities into bilateral meetings with Indian government counterparts.",

    "title": "India-US Trade Rift: Scenarios, Spillovers and Strategic Shifts",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Economics \\| 2 min read \\| September 2025 # India-US Trade Rift: Scenarios, Spillovers and Strategic Shifts As the standoff between the two countries continues, we analyze likely scenarios, macro spillovers, and India's countercyclical and strategic response - Tensions between India and the United States have risen, after the latter imposed a 50% tariff rate - The power balance tilts towards the US, but India also has a large consumer market, provides opportunities for US in defense and energy sectors and acts as a strategic counterweight to China - Higher US tariffs are a near-term growth drag, but they will trigger diversification and further reforms. We expect India’s global value chain integration to be disrupted, rather than derailed by these tariffs Since US President Donald Trump’s imposition of a 50% tariff rate on India (25% reciprocal tariff plus a 25% Russia penalty), the standoff between India and the Unites States has continued. In this article, we look at possible scenarios and medium-term implications in light of these tariffs being implemented. India has maintained a defiant stance on protecting farmers’ interests. Multiple outcomes are possible from here, with different implications. On trade, the US and India have held five rounds of negotiations, where India offered zero tariffs on industrial goods, and agreed to gradually reduce tariffs on US cars, but disagreements emerged over India’s reluctance to open its agriculture (genetically modified crops) and dairy sectors, which are politically important for President Trump. A fundamental misalignment also emerged between the two nations' approaches: India sought a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement, while it appears the Trump administration preferred a quick deal. India's response has been notably resolute across multiple fronts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emphasized unwavering protection of farmers' interests, even at personal cost, and has encouraged citizens to buy goods domestically. Within India, both opposition leaders and business community representatives have rallied behind the government's position, accepting short-term economic pain over perceived international pressure. In our base case, we assume the 25% reciprocal tariff remains in place through FY26, but the 25% Russian penalty is effective only until November. As such, we expect GDP growth at 6.6% y-o-y in FY26, after considering other policy offsets. On the other hand, if both sides dig in their heels, resulting in a continuation of the 50% tariff rate, then we would expect the hit to GDP growth to be 0.8 percentage points on an annualized rate basis. The current account deficit is also likely to deteriorate to around 1.1% of GDP. We see significant spillovers hitting investment and consumption through job losses in export intensive sectors, with further escalation risks through tariffs or non-tariff barriers. With the new tariff structure, the cost differential between India and China has narrowed, and between India and Southeast Asian competitors, it has moved in favor of the latter. This could have various effects on the shape of new supply chains such as the negative impact on textiles, leather and toys, and Indian firms possibly relocating their production to lower tariff countries to retain their US customer base. However, this will merely disrupt global value chain integration for India, not derail it entirely. We expect the government to announce a multi-pronged response, with fiscal and financial support for exporters, focus on export diversification and fast-tracking free trade agreements. More reforms are also likely. Goods and services tax rationalization has already been announced, and we expect further reforms such as FDI liberalization, deregulation, factor market reforms, privatization, and administrative reforms.

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies.

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

More than 71 percent of India’s total installed renewable energy capacity, which stands at approximately 247 gigawatt (GW), comes from solar and wind installations. This surge in clean energy generation, particularly from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources like solar and wind, is prompting a paradigm shift in power transmission dynamics. Power transmission is a critical component of the electricity value chain, and a robust and resilient network is essential for integrating the increasing RE capacity into the grid. Historically, India’s power transmission network has been among the most advanced in the world, characterised by proactive planning and upgrades that have resulted in minimal congestion and strong operational performance. However, the significantly shorter gestation periods of VRE installations have left the transmission network struggling to keep pace with RE deployment. The result is a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of energy evacuation infrastructure. The diurnal and seasonal variability of VRE further complicates transmission planning, leading to stranded RE assets and underutilisation of transmission infrastructure. Currently, around 50 GW of RE capacity is stranded across India, resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. The rising complications in VRE evacuation and its integration into the power transmission network have prompted power regulators to ramp up their transmission planning efforts. In September 2025, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) Chairperson Ghanshyam Prasad reaffirmed the goal of integrating 600 GW of renewables into India’s power grid by 2032. He noted that to ensure seamless integration, the CEA has shifted to potential-based planning, adding that the plans will be revised every six months to reflect continuously evolving ground realities. Monthly meetings are also being held to expedite investment planning and prevent delays in approvals and execution. ## Obstacles to an efficient power transmission system Turning the increased planning efforts into actual implementation will require addressing the persistent challenges that hinder the development of green power transmission, like difficulties in land acquisition for right of way, and overseas transmission equipment procurement constraints, among other issues. Also, state-specific issues—such as Rajasthan’s great Indian bustard (GIB) case concerning the critically endangered bird’s deaths from collisions with overhead power lines—further demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of delays that transmission network expansion can face, stretching gestation periods of transmission projects further vis-à-vis solar and wind. Rajasthan, in particular, is grappling with significant transmission bottlenecks, making it a hotspot of stranded RE assets. The primary reasons for this include delayed commissioning of transmission infrastructure, technical and ecological hurdles, and speculative grid access. As of July 2025, around 8 GW out of Rajasthan’s 22 GW of operational inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected RE projects remained stranded. Additionally, these projects also faced generation curtailment of roughly 3.8 GW in the same month. These issues underscore the broader problem of rapidly developing geographically concentrated RE capacity without adequate planning and growth of evacuation infrastructure. The Rajasthan government’s proposal this year to establish 2,000 megawatt-hour (MWh) of grid-scale battery energy storage aims to mitigate RE power curtailments and improve state grid utilisation. ## The need for a strategic roadmap A comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap is essential to ensure that Rajasthan and other RE-rich states can sustainably integrate future RE capacity additions. This roadmap should be target-oriented and timeline-bound with clearly specified deadlines and associated penalties. It should incorporate cluster-level demand forecasting by coordinating with state IT, industry, and urban development agencies to identify emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle charging (EV) hubs. Moreover, given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, the roadmap must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. The roadmap should also recognise the importance of energy storage systems (ESS). Critical in power generation and distribution, ESSs will also play a vital role in the green power transmission sector. At key transmission nodes, storage systems can provide valuable ancillary services such as frequency regulation, voltage stability, congestion management, and black start capabilities. The roadmap must incorporate and clearly specify the state-wise transmission-focused energy storage requirements. India’s power transmission sector is highly concentrated and averse to foreign and private sector investment. Encouraging participation and fostering an investor-friendly climate will be essential to build the requisite transmission capacity organically. Transmission planning and operations must leverage advanced forecasting, load-flow modelling, and real-time monitoring to enhance predictability and operational efficiency. Additionally, there is a need to move beyond conventional power purchase agreement (PPA) or merit-order based dispatch systems and transition to a security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) model. SCED optimises real-time generation schedules by accounting for constraints such as transmission limits, generator ramp rates, and reserve requirements. Ultimately, a modern and robust transmission network will form the invisible backbone of India’s power sector, one that is flexible, resilient, and fully aligned with the country’s long-term decarbonisation goals.

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen from politically sensitive targets, and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents from the Offices of the Dalai Lama, and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing sensitive information on citizens of numerous third party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business information, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while operating core servers located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and motivation of the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some of the associations of the attackers through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an eight month, collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and SecDev) and the Shadowserver Foundation. The investigation employed a fusion methodology, combining technical interrogation techniques, data analysis, and field research, to track and uncover the Shadow cyber espionage network.

    "full_text": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India...",

Looking at broader, long-term geopolitical impacts, natural disasters can play a part in determining geopolitical fates. But if they do anything at all, they often only accelerate existing trends.

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

Bonds generally present less short-term risk and volatility than stocks, but contain interest rate risk (as interest rates raise, bond prices usually fall); issuer default risk; issuer credit risk; liquidity risk; and inflation risk. These effects are usually pronounced for longer-term securities. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Currency Risk is a form of risk that arises from the change in price of one currency against another.

Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance Washington could start imposing tariffs against a wider...
