It amends the [Citizenship Act of 1955](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_nationality_law) to grant a swifter path to Indian citizenship under the assumption of [religious persecution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_persecution) to any individual belonging to the specific minorities of [Hindus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus), [Sikhs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs), [Buddhists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist), [Jains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain), [Parsis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsis) and Christians from [Afghanistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan), [Bangladesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh) and [Pakistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan), who entered India on or before 31 December 2014.[\\[108\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-108) The Act also seeks to relax the requirement of residence in India for citizenship by [naturalisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalisation) from 11 years to 5 years for migrants covered under the Act.[\\[109\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-109) However, the Act does not mention Muslims and does not offer the same eligibility benefits to Muslim immigrants or immigrants belonging to other religions from those countries.[\\[110\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-Samuel-110) The Act also does not mention any benefits for various other refugees which form the bulk of the refugees living in India, such as [Sri Lankan Tamil refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils_in_India) who faced persecution during the [Sri Lankan Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War),[\\[111\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-111) [Rohingya refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_Refugee_Crisis) who were victims of the [Rohingya genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_genocide), [Nepali refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutanese_refugees) who faced [ethnic cleansing in Bhutan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing_in_Bhutan), and [Tibetan Buddhist refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_refugees_in_India) who faced persecution in China.[\\[112\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-WPCitizenship22-112) According to the [Intelligence Bureau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_Bureau_(India)), the immediate beneficiaries of the new law will be 25,447 Hindus, 5,807 Sikhs, 55 Christians, 2 Buddhists and 2 Parsis.[\\[113\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-angry22-113) ### Response [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests&action=edit&section=3) The passage of the Act sparked massive protests in India.[\\[110\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-Samuel-110) Protesters in [Assam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam) and other [northeastern states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_India) oppose the grant of [Indian citizenship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_citizenship) to any refugee or immigrant, regardless of their religion, because they fear it would alter the region's demographic balance. They have campaigned since the 1970s against all refugees, and they fear that the new law will cause a loss of their political rights, culture and land.[\\[95\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-BBC_2_Dead-95)[\\[96\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-iexpressassam-96)[\\[97\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-reuters1211-97) They are also concerned that it will trigger more migration from [Bangladesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh) as well as violate the [Assam Accord](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Accord), which was a prior agreement reached with the central government on migrants and refugees.[\\[95\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-BBC_2_Dead-95)[\\[96\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-iexpressassam-96)[\\[97\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-reuters1211-97) After the act was passed, protests in the northeastern region turned violent. Authorities had arrested over 3000 protesters as of 17 December 2019,[\\[73\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-IT_17Dec-73) and some news outlets have described these protests as [riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riots).[\\[114\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-114) Protesters say that the Act violates Clause 5 and Clause 6 of the 1985 [Assam Accord](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Accord).[\\[115\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-115) Critics have stated that the amendment Act is unconstitutional.[\\[116\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-116)[\\[117\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-guardian-117)[\\[118\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-118) The major opposition political parties state that it violates Constitution's Article 14, one that guarantees equality to all. They allege that the new law seeks to make Muslims second-class citizens of India, while preferentially treating non-Muslims in India.[\\[119\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-119) Critics of the Act have also stated that due to the [National Register of Citizens (NRC)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Citizens_of_India), Muslims could be made [stateless](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statelessness), while the Citizenship Amendment Act would be able to shield people with Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian identity as a means of providing them with Indian citizenship even if they fail to prove that they were citizens of India under the stringent requirements of the NRC. Some critics allege that it is a deliberate attempt at [disenfranchising](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfranchisement) and segregating Muslims in line with the [ethnonationalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnonationalist) [Hindutva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva) ideology of the ruling [Bharatiya Janata Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party) (BJP).[\\[120\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-120)[\\[81\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-IEConception-81)[\\[121\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-AsianAgeOrwellian-121) [Tavleen Singh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavleen_Singh) described the Act as India's first [Nuremberg Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws).[\\[122\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-122) The home minister [Amit Shah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah) had previously set a deadline for the implementation of a countrywide NRC by stating that the register would be rolled out before the [2024 Lok Sabha elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Indian_general_election).[\\[123\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-livemint_NRC-123) The Act was criticised by various NGOs, students bodies, and liberal, progressive, and socialist organisations across the country, with the [Indian National Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress) and other major political parties announcing their staunch opposition. Protests led by these groups are concerned that the new law discriminates against Muslims, and believe that Indian citizenship should also be granted to Muslim refugees and immigrants. The states of [Rajasthan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan), West Bengal, [Kerala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala), Maharashtra, [Madhya Pradesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh), Jharkhand[\\[124\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-124) and [Chhattisgarh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhattisgarh) – all ruled by political parties that oppose the BJP – have announced that they will not implement either the [National Register of Citizens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Citizens) (NRC) or the Citizenship Amendment Act. The states of [Bihar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar), Andhra Pradesh and [Odisha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha) have however refused to only implement the NRC, while the state of [Punjab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India) and the union territories of Delhi and [Puducherry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puducherry_(union_territory)) have refused to implement the Act while only expressing disapproval of the NRC.[\\[125\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-125)[\\[126\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-126)[\\[127\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-127) The states of [West Bengal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal) and [Kerala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) have also put a hold on all activities relating to the preparation and update of the [National Population Register](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Population_Register) which is necessary for the Census as well as the implementation of the [National Register of Citizens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Citizens).[\\[128\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-128) Although some of the states have opposed the Act, the [Union Home Ministry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(India)) clarified that states lack the legal power to stop the implementation of CAA. The Ministry stated that \"The new legislation has been enacted under the Union List of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution. The states have no power to reject it.\"[\\[129\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-Outlook_MP_19_Dec-129) The [Indian Union Muslim League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Union_Muslim_League) and various other bodies have also petitioned the [Supreme Court of India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India) to strike down the Act as illegal and unconstitutional.[\\[130\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-bbc-130) ## Chronology [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests&action=edit&section=4) ### December 2019 [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests&action=edit&section=5) - **4 December** - The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was cleared by the [Union Cabinet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers) for introduction in the parliament.[\\[131\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-131) - After the bill was cleared, violent protests erupted in Assam, especially in [Guwahati](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guwahati), and other areas in the state.[\\[132\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-ET_CAA_12-132) - In [Dispur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispur), several thousands of protesters broke down police barricades to protest in front of the [Assam Legislative Assembly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Legislative_Assembly) building.[\\[133\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-133)[\\[134\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-New_York_Times-134) - Demonstrations were held in [Agartala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agartala).[\\[135\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-135) Six people died and fifty people were injured in the protests against the Act.[\\[136\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-136)[\\[137\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-BBC_16_Dec-137) - **9 December** - The bill was introduced in the [Lok Sabha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha) by the Minister of Home Affairs, [Amit Shah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah).[\\[138\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-138) - **10 December** - The bill was passed with 311 members voting in favour and 80 against.[\\[139\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-139)[\\[140\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-140) - **11 December** - The bill was subsequently passed by the [Rajya Sabha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha) with 125 votes in favour and 105 votes against it.

Critics argue the CAA is discriminatory and undermines indigenous rights . The central government's decision to exclude most tribal areas from the CAA has been met with mixed reactions, as regions like Assam still largely fall outside the Sixth Schedule and are thus not exempted .[\\[603\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-603) Assam, due to its porous borders with Bangladesh, has been particularly affected by illegal immigration, which heightens the controversy surrounding the CAA . Existing student bodies, such as the Northeast Student Union (NESU), have been criticized for their inaction on the issue . In response, the Wesean Student Federation (WSF) was formed in March 2024, advocating for international intervention and urging the United Nations to address the CAA's discriminatory aspects .[\\[604\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-604)[\\[605\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-605) Calls for excluding the entire Northeast from the CAA's purview have been persistent, reflecting widespread regional discontent . In Assam, only areas under the Sixth Schedule, like the Bodoland Territorial Region, are exempt, leaving much of the state vulnerable to the CAA . This discrepancy has sparked questions about the state's policy consistency, as highlighted by All Assam Students Union Chief Advisor Samujjal Bhattacharya .[\\[606\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-606) Efforts to grant Scheduled Tribe status to additional Assamese communities could potentially lead to a tribal-majority state fully exempt from the CAA, though this has not yet materialized . Meanwhile, organizations like the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) are pushing for the implementation of an [Inner Line Permit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Line_Permit) system to further protect against illegal immigration .[\\[607\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-607) ### Other states and union territories [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests&action=edit&section=38) - **Meghalaya:** On 9 December, large scale protests were held in the state.

Vishwanathan, a senior advocate addressed the court, stating \"The most immediate concern now is the sweeping powers given to [executive authorities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)) to brand people as 'doubtful citizens'. Once this is done, there are no guidelines to help these people. This is sinister. It will lead to [gerrymandering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) of electoral rolls. The concern is spread across both the majority Hindus and the minorities as well. You have to address this fear... Otherwise fear and insecurity will pervade the country.\"[\\[290\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-SC_refuses_22_Jan-290) Reacting to the concerns the CJI stated that the laws like the CAA are not irreversible, and the court will hear the interim prayer for a stay on CAA at a future date in February.[\\[290\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-SC_refuses_22_Jan-290) On 3 March, the [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Human_Rights) (OHCHR), filed an application in the Supreme Court and asked to be made a party in the case citing \"the exclusions of persons... on the basis of their religion\". The OHCHR Commissioner, [Michelle Bachelet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Bachelet) said that the \"differentiations\" drawn by the Act are not \"sufficiently objective and reasonable\". However, the [Ministry of External Affairs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)) reacted to the move and said that the CAA is an \"internal matter\" of India and \"no foreign party had any locus standi on issues pertaining to India's sovereignty\".[\\[813\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-813)[\\[348\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_note-UN_moves_to_SC-348) ## See also [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests&action=edit&section=68) - [India portal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:India) - [Politics portal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Politics) - [Law portal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Law) - [History portal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:History) - [Freedom of speech portal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Freedom_of_speech) - [Society portal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Society) - [2019 Jamia Millia Islamia attack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Jamia_Millia_Islamia_attack) - [2020 JNU Attack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_JNU_Attack) - [Assam Accord](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Accord) - [Assam Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Movement) - [National Register of Citizens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Citizens) - [North East Delhi Riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Delhi_Riots) - [Shaheen Bagh protests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheen_Bagh_protests) ## References [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests&action=edit&section=69) 001. **[^](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests#cite_ref-1)**[\"After Aligarh, protests in Hyderabad, Varanasi, Kolkata over Jamia clashes\"](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-aligarh-protests-in-hyderabad-varanasi-kolkata-against-jamia-clashes/story-QdM909mlrIVN1SdWT3zrJI.html). _Hindustan Times_. 16 December 2019.

Of these, the threat posed by Naxalism, a Maoist insurrection active in the eastern half of the country for over four decades, is the most overlooked and analytically neglected in Western academic and security circles. In the past seven years, Naxalite activity has grown in scope, breadth, and violence, in a “Red Corridor” stretching from Nepal to Tamil Nadu, and killed or displaced tens of thousands of people. By 2006, the problem was so severe that India’s Prime Minister characterized the insurgency as the greatest internal security threat ever faced by his country. Given India’s bloody history with separatist and communal violence, such a pronouncement is truly startling. This thesis undertakes an historical analysis of the Naxalite movement to assess how great a danger its current iteration truly poses, and what the implications might be for India’s continued rise. Soberingly, it finds that the insurgency is indeed stronger and more dangerous today than at any time in the past. Furthermore, while it does not pose an existential threat to the state in the same way as its counterpart in Nepal, it will prove extremely disruptive to India’s further growth and development if not swiftly and effectively countered. New Delhi’s efforts in this regard are so far unimpressive, but it is not too late to act. The United States has a vested interest in the emergence of a strong and stable India, and may be able to help its new “strategic partner” address the challenge of Naxalism’s resurgence.

PURPOSE “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problem of Naxalism is the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”1 With this startling pronouncement in April 2006, India’s Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, finally drew the West’s attention to an insurgency that had plagued his country for more than four decades, taking nearly 20,000 lives in the process.2 While the world was fixated on the violence in Kashmir, fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and intermittent bouts of Hindu\u0002Muslim sectarian violence, an archaic Maoist ideology, rejected even in the land of its birth, was growing in scope, breadth, and violence. Over the past seven years in particular, Naxalite rebels have come to control large swathes of the Indian countryside in a “Red Corridor” stretching from Nepal to Tamil Nadu and killed thousands of Indian security forces and civilians. This thesis will examine the evolution of the Naxalite threat, from its humble beginnings in 1967 to the present, to ascertain the true danger posed to India’s rise as a twenty-first century Asian power. B. IMPORTANCE Since the end of the Cold War and economic reforms in the early 1990s, India’s performance has been truly staggering. It would be difficult to overstate the key role the country is expected to assume in the global community over the coming decades. With a population of over 1.2 billion, a young, growing, and increasingly educated workforce, and persistent real GDP growth rates in the area of 8 percent over the last decade, India is emerging as a powerful driver of the world economy.3 Its demographic clout and 1 Manmohan Singh, “Prime Minister’s Speech to the 2nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of Chief Ministers on Naxalism,” (speech, New Delhi, India, April 13, 2006), Government of India Press Information Bureau, http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=17128 (accessed August 10, 2007). 2 Jane’s Information Group, “India’s Mosaic of Conflict,” Jane’s Terrorism and Security Monitor, July 14, 2004, http://www8.janes.com/ (accessed August 7, 2007). 3 Ibid. 2 political ambitions are also thrusting it increasingly into positions of international leadership, as the debate on its accession to permanent membership on the UN Security Council attests. If the twenty-first century is truly to be the “Asian Century,” India, along with China, will likely be leading the way. Since the late 1990s, India has also emerged as an increasingly important strategic partner to the United States. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, India was one of the first countries in Asia to extend its support in the Global War on Terror, offering refueling rights to U.S. ships and aircraft on their way toward Afghanistan. The strategic partnership has grown since then, most famously with the 10-year defense accord signed in 2005 and the U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation agreement of 2006.4 The United States has been assiduously cultivating a closer relationship with New Delhi, and greater military and strategic ties between the two countries are clearly important components of future U.S. foreign policy in Asia. However, India’s effectiveness as a world leader and U.S. strategic partner is contingent upon its continued internal stability and economic development. If Naxalism is as great a threat as many believe, its continuing spread will have serious negative repercussions on both fronts, to the detriment of India, the United States, and the larger world. A comprehensive examination and analysis of the phenomenon, and its potential to derail India’s development, is therefore both timely and important. C. LITERATURE REVIEW The Naxalist movement emerged in 1967 as an uprising of disaffected and disenfranchised peasants in Naxalbari, West Bengal. Given its four decade long existence, there is generally a surprising dearth of academic study on the movement. Western scholarship on insurgency in South Asia usually focuses on the conflict in Kashmir and (perhaps surprisingly) the plethora of smaller insurrections in India’s 4 Jane’s Information Group, “Sentinel Security Assessment - South Asia: India, External Affairs,” Jane’s Military and Security Assessments, April 26, 2007, http://www8.janes.com (accessed August 6, 2007). 3 Northeast.5 What little attention is paid to Naxalism is focused almost solely on the underlying causes of insurgent movements in general, treating Naxalism simply as one case in a larger group. Nevertheless, these treatments do provide valuable insight on contributing factors to the movement’s rise and persistence. There seem to be two main schools of thought on this issue. The first is that insurgencies arise out of unmet political demands, usually from a minority that feels it is being oppressed.6 The second school of thought cites economic inequality as a reason for insurgent uprising, typified by the revolts of lower class social groups against what they feel is lack of access to economic gain.7 A third, smaller body of literature stresses the importance of contributing factors, asserting that uprisings are more likely to occur where the terrain provides sanctuary to small groups that can train, equip, and educate their followers outside the reach of government forces.8 In the case of Naxalism, elements of all three theories seem to be at play, and are echoed in the literature from outside the West. Unsurprisingly, the study of the Naxalite movement is more extensive in India itself. Here, however, the problem seems to be not so much a lack of analysis, but the questionable objectivity, quality, and relevance of much of the scholarship. A few works on the early phases of Naxalite activity are extant, but many of these are biased to varying degrees, written by the movement’s sympathizers or even the Maoist revolutionaries themselves.9 Of somewhat greater objectivity are a handful of histories authored by journalists, but their scope, too, is limited to the earliest years of Naxalite 5 Lawrence E.

With respect to more recent analysis, there appears to be relatively little peer- reviewed research on the subject. In its place is a fairly large volume of study, of varying quality, from numerous interested parties and private organizations. While this situation presents a unique opportunity for original research, it also poses the challenge of separating objective, factual analysis from more biased or skewed reporting. Within this latter body of more recent literature, the vast majority of debate focuses on the causes of the current phase of Naxalite insurgency and speculation as to the most effective ways to deal with it. Broadly speaking, two groups with competing viewpoints emerge from all this contention. The first, or “law and order” camp, considers the Naxalite problem primarily a security issue. The main proponents of this point of view are security analysts and researchers like K.P.S. Gill and Ajai Sahni, many of them associated with India-based think tanks like the Institute for Conflict Management.11 While acknowledging socio-economic marginalization as a contributing factor, they view the lack of effective state and municipal policing, poor coordination of security efforts with New Delhi, and lenient policies toward Naxalite groups as the root causes of the insurgency. Citing numerous failed efforts at peace talks with what they view as an intransigent, nihilistic enemy, this group advocates strongly for the active suppression of Naxalism by force, with increased utilization of central government forces if necessary.12 10 For examples, see: Sankar Ghosh, The Naxalite Movement: A Maoist Experiment (Calcutta: Firma K.L. Mukhopadhyay, 1974); Sohail Jawaid, The Naxalite Movement in India: Origin and Failure of the Maoist Revolutionary Strategy in West Bengal 1967-1971 (New Delhi: Associated Publishing House, 1979). 11 The Institute for Conflict Management, “An Introduction,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/icm/index.html (accessed July 19, 2007). 12 Much of the literature generated by these analysts is published on the ‘South Asia Terrorism Portal.’ Organized by K.P.S. Gill, the controversial ‘supercop’ who crushed the Sikh insurgency in Punjab in the early 1990s, the SATP is a comprehensive resource for writings and analysis on terrorism and related security issues in South Asia. In particular, see: K.P.S. Gill, “Imperatives of Justice,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, April 30, 2005, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/07june25pio.htm (accessed July 20, 2007); K.P.S. Gill, “Blood Sweat and Anger,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, July 13, 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/06dailynewsjuly13.htm (accessed July 20, 2007); Ajai Sahni, “The Angry Men of Mao,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, February 4, 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/ajaisahni/dailynews&analysis13022007.htm (accessed July 20, 2007). 5 In contrast, the “development” camp views Naxalism as fundamentally the result of poverty and political disenfranchisement. Represented by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and the Asian Center for Human Rights, and think tanks such as the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, this camp takes a far more holistic attitude toward the most desirable means of combating Naxal violence.13 Stressing the need for poverty reduction, land reform, and better local governance, adherents to this line of reasoning reject government sponsored violence as a solution to the Naxalite problem except in the most extreme circumstances.14 As P. V. Ramana puts it, “If the military option were effective, then the problem should not have resurfaced after the initial Naxalbari uprising was suppressed.”15 Indeed, this group views overly aggressive action on the part of security forces as one of the contributing causes of further radicalization in the countryside. At first blush, the position of Ramana and his cohorts strikes one as an oversimplification of an extremely nuanced security situation. How, for example, is development aid supposed to be distributed if the people in the process of doing so are consistently under the threat of Naxalite attack? The same can be said, however, of the “law and order” argument, and its rather singular emphasis on the use of force to quell an insurgency that doubtless draws much support from the disaffection of the rural poor. Analysis of many prior guerrilla conflicts has certainly drawn attention to the need for addressing the underlying causes of rural discontent in order to draw support away from 13 For examples, see: Asian Centre for Human Rights, “Naxal Conflict in 2006,” Asian Centre for Human Rights Report, http://pdfdownload.bofd.net/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.achrweb.org%2Freports%2Findia% 2FAR07%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Freports%2Findia%2Fnaxal0107.pdf (accessed August 6, 2007); Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, “Left Extremism in India: Naxal Movement in Chattisgarh & Orissa,” Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Special Report 25, June 2006; http://pdftohtml.ganjalinux.org/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipcs.org%2FIPCS-Special\u0002Report-25.pdf (accessed August 6, 2007). 14 Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, “Naxalism and Internal Security in India,” Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Seminar, August 4, 2007, http://www.ipcs.org/newIpcsSeminars2.jsp?action=showView&kValue=2362 (accessed August 6, 2007). 15 Ibid. 6 the insurgent base.16 Additionally, neither group adequately examines the efficacy of previous governmental policies and responses, a rather glaring oversight if one hopes to prescribe a current course of action. Compounding the debate is disagreement on the nature of the threat currently posed by the insurgency. The “law and order” crowd focuses almost exclusively on the movement’s implications for political stability in India, but their analysis tends to be a bit shrill.17 While there has certainly been a greater level of political instability in the regions affected by Naxalism, it has tended to remain in the country’s remote rural areas. Their assertions that the ‘Red Menace’ threatens to split India in two and seriously undermine central authority seems hyperbolic, especially given the fact that the movement draws on, at the most, 10,000 - 20,000 hard-core cadres.18 The “development camp,” by contrast, tends to view the Naxalist threat primarily in terms of its humanitarian dimension. These analysts focus on the recent internal displacement of tens of thousands of rural and tribal peoples, and the atrocities committed by both Maoist rebels and the government security forces, as the insurgency’s greatest dangers.19 While this argument is emotionally compelling, it is by no means clear that this aspect of the threat represents a serious strategic problem for New Delhi in and of itself. India’s population is enormous, and the small percentage directly affected account for only marginal contributions to overall GDP.20 What seem to be greater threats are the larger economic implications of the Naxalite insurgency in the context of India’s growth and development, and its potential for further spread as the social impacts of globalization are felt throughout the country. 16 For an excellent example of this argument, see Jeffrey Race, War Comes to Long An: Revolutionary Conflict in a Vietnamese Province (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1972). 17 Ajai Sahni, “Left Wing Extremism in India: Evolving Strategies for Containment,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, October 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/ajaisahni/crpfdelhi.htm (accessed August 6, 2007). 18 Reuters, “Indian Maoist Violence,” Reuters AlertNet, June 27, 2007, http://www.alertnet.org/printable.htm?URL=/db/crisisprofiles/IN_MAO.htm (accessed August 6, 2007). 19 See the aforementioned Asian Center for Human Rights Report, “Naxal Conflict in 2006” and Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Seminar, “Naxalism and Internal Security in India.” 20 Ibid. 7 As The Economist recently noted, the five states most affected by insurgent violence account for significant mineral deposits and a majority of the nation’s energy resources.21 Also, while Naxalist expansion into the Western and Southern Deccan has received some scrutiny, no serious attention is being given to its possible spread into India’s wild Northeastern states. On initial inspection, the political stability, development level, and demography of this region appear eerily similar to those areas already afflicted by Naxalite violence.22 The fact that the Northeast also contains significant fossil fuel deposits only adds to the threat of the Maoists gaining a foothold.23 Clearly, any worthwhile examination of the dangers posed by Naxalism must take into account the changing nature of the social and economic contexts within which it operates. The analytical oversights and divergences of opinion discussed above are also reflected within the administration in New Delhi, where contradictory statements, confusion, and inconsistent policymaking characterize governmental responses to the most recent Maoist threat.24 As might be expected, these efforts have proven less than effective in countering the Naxalite problem, or even checking its growth in recent years. This manifest intellectual incoherence on the part of leaders, analysts, and policymakers has many causes, but is mainly due to a lack of perspective on the nature of the challenge confronting them. In an examination of the literature on this subject, from all the various points of view, the most striking feature is the absence of any comprehensive historical analysis of the Naxalite movement, the evolution of its organization, aims, and leadership, or how India’s own political, economic, and social development has contributed to (or ameliorated) the virulence of the movement. Given the relatively long lifespan of this 21 Economist, “India’s Politics,” Economist Intelligence Unit ViewsWire, March 19, 2007, http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8875555 (accessed August 7, 2007). 22 Cline, 126-149. 23 Jane’s Information Group, “Sentinel Security Assessment - South Asia: India, Natural Resources,” Jane’s Military and Security Assessments, April 27, 2005, http://www8.janes.com (accessed August 6, 2007). 24 P.V.

With the recent spread of Naxalite activity and the notable concern it has elicited from high levels of the Indian government, this lack of an objective, realistic, and comprehensive examination represents a significant gap in the existing literature on the subject. This thesis will aim to fill that gap. D. METHODOLOGY AND SOURCES This thesis will use the comparative case study method to analyze the evolution of the Naxalite movement and assess the danger posed by the most recent upsurge in Naxalite activity. To draw an important distinction, it will not directly address the veracity of Prime Minister Singh’s assertion that “Naxalism is the single greatest internal security challenge ever faced” by his country. Given the plethora of insurgencies and violent communal movements still active in India, such an assessment would provide enough material for several lengthy theses. Instead, the central question posed here is whether the Naxalite movement currently represents a qualitatively different, and more dangerous, challenge to Indian political stability and development than it has in the past. As mentioned previously, the Naxalite insurgency is not a new phenomenon in India, and has been a thorn in the side of the country for over four decades. Generally speaking, its history can be broken down into three distinct periods, most easily distinguished by their level of insurgent activity and violence. The first period runs from the movement’s beginning in 1967 to its temporary suppression in 1972. This era encompassed the initial organization of the Naxalite movement and the rather rapid spread from its birthplace in West Bengal to a number of other states, notably Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. The second period, from 1972 until about 1991, was notable for the ideological and physical fragmentation of the movement, and its mostly localized activity in pockets of rural India. The third period (perhaps not coincidentally contemporaneous with India’s economic reforms) runs from 1991 to the present, and is distinguished by a process of gradual consolidation, culminating in the merger of the two most powerful insurgent groups (Maoist Communist Center and the 9 People’s War Group) in late 2004.25 The years since 2000 have witnessed the most dramatic escalation in the scope, breadth, and intensity of Naxalite violence. These three periods of activity will comprise the individual cases under investigation. To assess the nature and danger of the insurgency in each era, we will examine how variations in three independent variables (the socio-economic and political milieux, internal characteristics of the Naxalite movement, and governmental response) affected the dependent variable, the overall level of threat posed by the movement. These three cases will then be compared to determine whether or not the Naxalite movement indeed represents a greater danger to India than it has in the past, what specifically that danger is, and how it is likely to develop in the future. Finally, I will explore the implications for India’s continued rise and its prospects as a strategic partner of the United States. Primary and secondary source materials are utilized to the maximum extent practical. Primary sources consist largely of internal documents from the Government of India and Naxalite organizations, as well as quotes and speeches from government and insurgent leaders. As mentioned in the literature review, there is not as much rigorous academic source material on this issue as one might like. What peer-reviewed work there is receives primacy of place, but publications and studies from interested NGOs, think tanks, and security analysts also contain valuable information, and are included in this study. Finally, significant tertiary source material, in the form of coverage from reputable news media like The Economist, Frontline (an Indian weekly), and the Times of India, is required to fill factual gaps in the existing literature. E. TERMINOLOGY ISSUES For the purposes of this thesis, the generic term Maoist will refer to the Indian variety and be used interchangeably with Naxalite. Obviously, Maoist movements and organizations exist in many forms throughout the world and there are a number of others active in South Asia, most famously in Nepal. Other than a shared political ideology and 25 P.V. Ramana, “The Maoist Movement in India,” Defense and Security Analysis 22, no. 4 (December 2006): 435-449. 10 sympathy with each other’s causes, these groups remain separate and distinct entities, and care should be taken not confuse or conflate Naxalism with other Maoist movements more generally. When referring to Maoist organizations other than the Naxalites, the full name and country of origin are provided to avoid ambiguity. 11 II. THE ORGANIZATIONAL PERIOD (1967–1972) A. INTRODUCTION To inform an assessment of the relative threat posed by the current Naxalite insurgency, this chapter will undertake an historical analysis of the movement’s organization and initial activity in the period from 1967 to 1972. This era encompasses the birth of Naxalism and its fairly rapid rise as a force on the Indian political scene, and therefore presents a potentially illuminating parallel to the resurgence of violent Maoism in recent years. It also witnessed the movement’s initial failure, and so may contain useful lessons for countering the modern threat. To begin, a brief look at the history of Indian communism is in order. For the world’s largest democracy, India has a surprisingly long and complicated relationship with Marxist ideology. First emerging in 1920, in the fires of the Indian independence movement, it has grown into a major force on the sub-continent’s political scene. While all of its proponents adhere to the ultimate goal of building a utopian classless society, they have not always agreed on the most desirable method of achieving it. Nevertheless, whether motivating an underground subversive element or an aboveground, election-contesting political party, the basic ideology has proven remarkably resilient in the Indian context. Any examination of the birth of the Naxalite movement in the latter half of the 1960s requires an understanding of its development within this larger phenomenon. Jawaid Sohail, an Indian academic studying the origins of the Naxalites, divides the evolution of the Indian communist movement into six broad periods.26 From its birth until 1941, the Communist Party of India (CPI) suffered from poor organization and leadership. Outlawed by the British colonial authorities, it languished in relative obscurity. However, when Great Britain formed an alliance with the Soviet Union following the outbreak of World War II, the communists enjoyed a new legitimacy, 26 Jawaid, 4. 12 which they exploited by allying themselves with the popular Indian National Congress from 1941-1945. After World War II, this alliance foundered on the emerging international split between East and West, and the CPI moved into opposition against the growing power of Congress in New Delhi. Around the time of India’s independence in 1947, a struggle erupted between the peasants and their ruler in the princely state of Hyderabad, which was vacillating on accession to the Indian union. Inspired by the contemporaneous example of Mao’s “People’s Revolution” in China (and encouraged by its ideological benefactor, the Soviet Union), the CPI embarked on the fourth phase of its activity, supporting an armed agrarian uprising against feudal oppression in Hyderabad that became known as the Telangana movement. In 1948, when the Indian armed forces moved in to forcibly annex the Hyderabad principality, the Telangana insurgents turned against New Delhi. While this initial struggle achieved some degree of early success, temporarily “liberating” more than 3,000 villages and 16,000 square miles of territory, a confluence of events resulted in its ultimate demise. The strength of the Indian armed forces eventually proved overpowering, and a large number of the rebels were killed. Additionally, in an attempt to curry favor with India, the Soviet Union (which had encouraged the uprising in its earlier days) summarily withdrew its support. Taking the hint, the CPI dutifully followed suit in 1951.27 The failure of Telangana inaugurated the fifth period of communist activity, when the CPI, again at Soviet urging, sought to contest national and state elections in a bid to bring about the peaceful imposition of communist rule through democratic conduct. For many of the CPI’s more radical cadres, however, this decision was viewed as a betrayal of the Party’s revolutionary heritage. The memories of Telangana loomed large in their ideological imaginings and a sizeable faction of the CPI began to drift toward a more Maoist interpretation of Marxism-Leninism as the 1950s progressed.28 27 Ajay Mehra, “Naxalism in India: Revolution or Terror?” Terrorism and Political Violence 12, no. 2 (2000): 40-42. 28 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 20-22. 13 This rise of factionalism within the CPI defines the last of Sohail’s six phases and would reach its zenith in the 1960s. With the growing Sino-Soviet split from 1958-1964, the ideological tensions within the CPI continued to mount. These were only exacerbated by the emerging Sino-Indian border dispute in the early 1960s, in which the CPI leadership came down firmly on the side of New Delhi. The pro-Chinese leftists within the party branded this policy as revisionism of the worst sort, and attempted to wrest control from the pro-Soviet faction. Unable to muster sufficient support, they instead broke away from the CPI in 1964 to form the Communist Party of India-Marxist, or CPI- (M).29 However, the CPI-(M) was almost immediately beset by the same kind of ideological infighting that had precipitated its formation. The relatively more restrained group that formed the party’s leadership, though still hostile to the Soviet Union, grudgingly embraced electoral politics as a means of bringing about a more or less peaceful revolution in India. Consequently, when the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War broke out, it quickly condemned Pakistan and its Chinese patron in an effort to capitalize on the wave of nationalist sentiment sweeping India. This tactic proved remarkably successful, and CPI-(M) candidates enjoyed surprising success in the 1967 elections in West Bengal, firmly entrenching the new party within the Indian political process. This proved to be too much for the more radical Maoist faction, and it was within this contentious milieu that the Naxalite movement was born.30 There were now three major communist strands within India: the CPI, the CPI- (M), and the violently radical Maoists. This last group, eventually named for the birthplace of their armed struggle in Naxalbari, West Bengal, would in due course form a third, underground organization, the Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist, or CPI- (ML). Unlike its progenitors, the CPI-(ML) was totally opposed to the electoral process and espoused violent revolution as the only legitimate means of realizing its political agenda. In short, this entailed nothing less than the complete overthrow of the existing 29 Dipak K. Gupta, “The Naxalites and the Maoist Movement in India: Birth, Demise, and Reincarnation,” Democracy and Security 3, no. 2 (May 2007): 166. 30 Jawaid, 76-78. 14 political structure, corrupted as it was by the four evils of “U.S. imperialism, Soviet social-imperialism, feudalism, and comprador-bureaucrat capital.”31 From 1967-1972, this group embarked on a campaign of political terror that caused no small amount of consternation to national and state governments, and resonated, at least initially, with many poor residents of West Bengal, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh. To understand why, one must appreciate India’s broader political, economic, and social contexts during this period. B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments The first seventeen years of India’s independence were marked by the political hegemony of the Congress Party, personified in the undisputed leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru.32 Under his charismatic influence, the fissiparous tendencies of India’s many ethnic, linguistic, religious, and social groups were kept in check, and the country emerged as a surprising beacon of political stability in South Asia. His passing in 1964, however, (and the subsequent death of his successor, Lal Bahadur Shastri, after only two years in power) left the Congress Party rudderless, and the leadership that had united India’s various groups under the mantle of nationalism was gone. Over the next few years, the INC embarked on a process of infighting that diminished its iron grip on political power and allowed alternative forces of social mobilization to pose new challenges to its authority.33 From 1966-1972, this drama played out at the national level in the struggle between Indira Gandhi and Morarji Desai for the position of Prime Minister and head of 31 Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist),” May 1970, reprinted in Sankar Ghosh, The Naxalite Movement: A Maoist Experiment, (Calcutta: Firma K. L. Mukhopadhyay, 1974), 190-199. 32 For outstanding one volume histories of India, see: John Keay, India: A History (New York: Grove Press: 2000);0 Stanley Wolpert, A New History of India: 7th Edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004). 33 Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952-2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed.

While Mrs. Gandhi emerged at the head of a coalition of Congress factions, the structure proved too unwieldy to contest the 1967 national elections as effectively as it had in the past. Beset by a number of economic and social crises (discussed below), Congress suffered its worst electoral performance in history, winning only 40% of the popular vote and barely hanging on to majority in a parliament it had previously dominated.34 With its attention again focused inwardly, factional battles quickly resumed. Following another disappointing performance in the mid-term elections of 1969, the party officially split into two competing camps: Congress (O) under Morarji Desai, and Congress (R) under Indira {later Congress (I)}.35 Though she still commanded a plurality in parliament, Mrs. Gandhi now had to rely on a coalition of leftist parties to give her a working majority, a fact that complicated her ability to respond forcefully to the growing Naxalite movement. The decline in Congress hegemony at the center was mirrored by its performance in the state elections of 1967. From a position of complete dominance in nearly all the state legislatures, the party won only 1,661 of a total 3,453 contested seats.36 Moreover, for the first time, non-Congress led coalition governments came to power in a number of states. These included West Bengal and Orissa, both of which would shortly be affected by the growing Naxalite movement. Notably, the United Democratic Front (UDF) government that formed in West Bengal contained a large and influential bloc of CPI-(M) legislators, a fact that proved important on a number of counts. As previously mentioned, the party’s successful embrace of electoral politics served to further radicalize the already restive militant faction within the CPI-(M). Additionally, while the moderate members of the CPI-(M) and the Naxalites did become bitter enemies, as we shall see, the legacy of their earlier cooperation and shared ideology would greatly complicate the state government’s efforts to effectively counter their activities. The structural shifts underway on India’s political scene thus served to facilitate the emergence and spread of Naxalism in a number of ways. The temporary decline of 34 Wolpert, 382-383. 35 Ibid., 385. 36 Ibid., 383. 16 legitimacy at the center created greater instability that allowed alternative ideologies to take root, while the rise to power of a number of leftist parties (including the Communists) provided breathing room for their more extreme ideological brethren. Concurrently, the new requirements of coalition building diverted politicians’ attention from the essential task of ensuring security in their constituencies.37 To these must be added one more consideration: the fractious nature of political activity undoubtedly complicated the policymaking process at a time when the country faced a range of serious economic problems. While these did not necessarily arise as a result of the political turmoil, the ability of the system to effectively address them was certainly curtailed. 2. Economic Developments In spite of a series of Soviet-inspired Five Year Plans from 1951-1966, India remained a predominantly rural, agrarian economy. Burdened by generally inefficient and backward agricultural methods, it was extremely prone to underproduction and food shortages, a situation exacerbated by the country’s rapidly expanding population. The lack of proper irrigation and over-dependence on the seasonal monsoon rains caused widespread famine in 1952-53, and severe (if localized) food shortages in Bihar and West Bengal from 1965 to 1967.38 Perennially reliant on foreign food aid, particularly from the United States, Indira’s government was forced to seek even greater assistance from America in 1966, which she received in the form of increased wheat shipments and over $400 million U.S. for the implementation of India’s fourth Five-Year Plan.39 The focus of this plan was, in the words of Mrs. Gandhi, to “lay the foundation for a breakthrough in agriculture in the countryside,” primarily through state subsidization for a host of agrarian technology reforms that came to be known as the Green Revolution. Indeed, the combination of expanded irrigation networks, increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, and the utilization of higher-yielding crop varietals that had become available in 1965 did improve the food situation; by the early 1970s, India 37 Rabindra Ray, The Naxalites and their Ideology (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1988), 115. 38 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 212; Wolpert, 362, 380. 39 Wolpert, 380-381. 17 was self-sufficient in grain production for the first time in its history.40 Like most revolutions, however, this one took time to develop and produced a large amount of economic dislocation. Nowhere was this more evident than in West Bengal. These new technologies, while partly government sponsored, still required a fairly significant initial capital outlay to procure and utilize to their fullest advantage. Moreover, they tended to be best employed on relatively large tracts of land so cultivators could reap economies of scale in the new methods of production. As Edward Duyker points out in his study of the predominantly agrarian Santal tribe in West Bengal, this had the effect of economically favoring large landholders over smaller farmers, widening what were already significant income disparities between the two.41 In a system that had its roots in the Zamindars of the British colonial era, most of these smaller farmers were in fact sharecroppers, forced to give up as much as 50% of their harvest in rent to their jotedars, or landlords. To make matters worse, if smaller farmers were to avail themselves of the new technology at all, they often had to take out loans from village moneylenders at exorbitant rates of interest, usually only worsening their economic situation.42 What these long-suffering peasants were most in need of was a comprehensive system of land reform and rural development. Given the strongly socialist leanings of both Nehru and his daughter, the failure of the government to effectively tackle these problems previously was an indication of the power of entrenched vested interests. To be sure, a number of initiatives had been implemented, notably the Community Development and Rural Extension Program under the auspices of the Ford Foundation, the Panchayati Raj program, and a series of land reform laws in the 1950s and 60s.43 Unfortunately, a combination of corruption, cronyism, and loopholes in the legislation prevented any of these measures from having much of an impact on the landless laborers, 40 Keay, 524. 41 Edward Duyker, Tribal Guerrillas: The Santals of West Bengal and the Naxalite Movement (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1987), 55-57; Sumanta Banerjee, India’s Simmering Revolution: The Naxalite Uprising (London: Zed Books Ltd., 1984), 9-12. 42 Jawaid, 40-41; Gupta, 163. 43 Wolpert, 363-364. 18 tribals, and small farmers they were designed to help.44 On the contrary, larger landowners and jotedars were often able to twist the new regulations in their favor, worsening the plight of many of the rural poor, particularly in West Bengal. Nor were economic hardships confined to the countryside. Like most of India, Calcutta had been suffering from economic stagnation for a number of years, and when the Indian government was forced to devalue the rupee in 1966, it had financial repercussions that hit the city hard. The resulting inflation spawned an industrial recession in 1966-67, causing unemployment to increase to dangerous proportions, particularly among the educated youth. While precise figures for this period are unavailable, anecdotal evidence suggests that from one third to one half of all the unemployed were aged 16-24.45 With so much economic frustration in the cities and the countryside, it is not surprising that incidents of social unrest increased as well. 3. Social Developments Given the feudal socio-economic nature of much of its history, peasant uprisings in India were not uncommon. From 1783 to 1900 alone, at the height of the British Raj, over 100 such incidents affected the region to greater or lesser degrees, many of them in the perennially restive province of Bengal.46 As the Telangana uprising in the late 1940s showed, post-independence Indian society was no less susceptible to their occurrence. In retrospect, it appears obvious that many of the factors that had precipitated these events in the past were present in the latter half of the 1960s. As the living situation deteriorated for a substantial number of India’s peasants, strikes and food riots became increasingly frequent in the later 1960s.47 By 1967, many Bengali newspapers carried accounts of impoverished rural citizens driven to suicide by their dire economic straits.48 While the 44 Banerjee, 7-9. 45 Ibid., 32. 46 Mehra, 39. 47 Wolpert, 382. 48 Banerjee, 1. 19 authenticity of all these accounts is difficult to establish, they were emblematic of the desperation and discontent of a large segment of the Indian countryside. The situation in urban society was showing signs of similar strain. Disease, overcrowding, and a lack of adequate infrastructure had long been endemic to most of India’s major cities. Now, as a result of the chronic unemployment discussed in the previous section, increasing numbers of young people were also turning to petty criminality and other anti-social behavior. Known as the “lumpen-proletariat” in Marxist circles, the activities of these idle and angry youth served to further destabilize an already fragile social situation.49 Compounding this tendency was the wave of student radicalism sweeping the world in the latter 1960s. Anti-establishment rhetoric and leftist activism were common on university campuses throughout India, but especially prevalent in Calcutta. In 1965, the Communist faction captured the leadership of the student’s union at the prestigious Presidency College and embarked on a campaign of disobedience, strikes, and protests, many of them violent.50 As clashes between police and urban youths worsened over the ensuing years, Calcutta’s student population grew more radicalized. Watching these developments from their safe houses, the leaders of the Maoist faction in the CPI-(M) grew more confident by the day. The contradictions inherent in India’s “semi-feudal and semi-colonial” society, it seemed to them, were reaching their breaking point, and the situation was ripe for the masses to rise up and finally deliver India from its centuries of capitalist domination. To ignite this potent mixture of urban and rural unrest, all that was needed was a spark. 49 Banerjee, 33. 50 Ibid., 50-52. 20 C. INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NAXALITE INSURGENCY 1. Organization and Leadership Two men in particular laid the groundwork for Naxalism’s emergence in 1967. Kanu Sanyal, a long-time CPI-(M) organizer active among the Santal tribals in Darjeeling, was among those within the party who disagreed strongly with its newly conciliatory leanings toward New Delhi and electoral politics. He discovered an ideological mentor in a passionate but lesser known party functionary, Charu Mazumdar.51 Mazumdar, born to a high caste family in Darjeeling district in 1918, had joined the Communist movement as a young man while attending university, and remained active in the CPI and CPI-(M) for most of his adult life. By the mid-1960s, he had wholeheartedly embraced Maoism as the only valid form of Communist struggle for the Indian situation. Adhering to Mao’s dictum that “political power grows from the barrel of a gun,” Mazumdar utterly rejected electoral politics and sought to apply the lessons of the Chinese revolution, as he saw them, to the struggle in his own country.52 In this, he was greatly influenced by the writings of Lin Biao, the Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and his strategic formulations for guerrilla warfare.53 Mazumdar laid out his theories in a series of essays penned between 1965 and 1967 that served as something of a manifesto for his more radical comrades, particularly in West Bengal.54 In those two years, elements of the CPI-(M) started veering on a more overtly militant course. Under the guidance of Sanyal and Mazumdar, on March 3, 1967, an uprising of poor tribals and peasants erupted in the village of Naxalbari, in the Siliguri sub-division of Darjeeling. While initially confined to the seizure of land and food-grains hoarded by the jotedars, it soon turned violent and began spreading to other villages in Siliguri. By 51 Prakash Singh, The Naxalite Movement in India (New Delhi: Rupa & Co., 2006), 268-274. 52 Jawaid, 55. 53 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 126-127. 54 Biplab Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” Social Scientist 6, no. 12 (July 1978): 8- 10. 21 July 5, the movement had grown large enough to attract the attention of its ideological progenitor, the Communist Party of China (CPC), which, in an editorial in Beijing’s People’s Daily, lauded it as “a peal of spring thunder [that] has crashed over the land of India,” and “a development of tremendous significance for the Indian people’s revolutionary struggle.”55 In reality, the rebellion was not quite that momentous at this stage, as the ease with which it was put down by the West Bengal government would attest. In late July, increased police action and a near total lack of coordination within the movement began to take their toll, and the initial uprising disintegrated by September.56 Nevertheless, the fire had been lit. Mazumdar emerged as a revolutionary leader and his ideology attracted an increasing number of adherents. Now known as Naxalites, militant groups inspired by Mazumdar’s theories began appearing throughout India. Emboldened by China’s rhetorical support, Mazumdar and these like-minded radicals officially broke from the CPI-(M). In November 1967, the All India Coordination Committee of Revolutionaries (AICCR, later renamed the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries, AICCCR) was formed in an attempt to gather the various strands of Naxalism under the banner of one revolutionary party.57 Though largely successful, the deliberations in this body revealed a number of ideological differences among the groups that would prove extremely divisive in a few years. In two cases, that of the Andhra faction of the AICCCR led by Nagi Reddy and another group known as Dakshin Desh, the differences proved insurmountable at an early stage, resulting in their exclusion from the nascent organization. Nevertheless, in April 1969, the formation of the CPI-(ML), with Mazumdar at the head, was announced in Calcutta and quickly endorsed by the CPC.58 It had an estimated 17,000 members at its founding, the majority in Andhra 55 People’s Daily, “ Spring Thunder Breaks Over India,” July 5, 1967, reprinted in Prakash Singh, 259-264. While China did offer significant rhetorical support to the Naxalite movement early on, particularly through editorials in the People’s Daily and broadcasts on the government controlled Xinhua News Agency, there is little evidence of any more concrete assistance. . 56 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 12. 57 Ibid., 31. 58 Ibid., 33. 22 Pradesh and West Bengal.59 For the next three years, the CPI-(ML) would be the dominant face of Naxalism in India. With the pronouncement that the “Chinese Chairman is our Chairman, the Chinese path is our path,” Mazumdar’s agenda for the Naxalites was codified at the First Party Congress in May 1970. It explicitly called for a Maoist inspired violent overthrow of the Indian government by establishing liberated bases in the countryside, surrounding the cities, and eventually subsuming all of India within its “people’s democratic revolution.”60 While Mazumdar’s heady optimism may be understandable in the international political context of the late 1960s, the techniques he advocated for accomplishing these objectives were questionable, to say the least. 2. Strategy and Tactics Mazumdar’s strategy was predicated on the assumption that the contradiction between feudalism and the masses of India’s rural poor had reached the breaking point.61 In his estimation, the situation was ripe for a spontaneous uprising of the beleaguered peasants that would sweep the old political order from the scene in a few short years. In a 1968 article in Liberation, the Naxalites’ primary propaganda mouthpiece, Mazumdar opined that the People’s Liberation Army would be marching through the countryside “by the beginning of 1971, if not in 1970.”62 This outlook informed his strategic formulations in a number of ways. The first was an emphasis on the rural peasants as the true base of the revolution.63 The focus of revolutionary activity was squarely on the countryside, with urban agitation initially prohibited. However, with the majority of the rural population illiterate, Mazumdar was forced to rely on educated ideologues to form the ground level leadership of his organization. To this end, he encouraged the recruitment and 59 Rabindra Ray, 108. 60 “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist),” May 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 199; Jawaid, 36. 61 Ibid.,194. 62 Charu Mazumdar, writing in Liberation, Nov 1968, as reported in Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 62. 63 “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist,” May 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 194. 23 participation of educated urban youth, but demanded they leave the cities and adopt the ways of the local villagers to better indoctrinate and lead them in their revolutionary struggle.64 While a large number of radicalized college students (especially from Calcutta) heeded this call, their insinuation into rural society was highly problematic. Most were quite incapable of adapting to village life, and their different customs engendered suspicion from the more parochial tribals and farmers.65 As a result, while peasants were often capable of being motivated for local actions, they generally failed to adopt Naxalism’s broader ideology.66 As Dipak Gupta notes, the vast majority of activist cadres were educated and from upper caste Hindu families, with poor, illiterate peasants accounting for less than 20% of the committed membership.67 One reason for this apathy among the peasants may have been the Naxalites’ renunciation of mass movements, the second pillar of Mazumdar’s strategy. In his estimation, since the country was on the verge of a spontaneous revolution, it needed no organizing force to guide it. Indeed, mass organizations could only hurt the movement, as they would give the enemy a focus for retaliation.68 While the formation of the CPI- (ML) may seem to contradict this outlook, in reality, the party functioned more symbolically than as a classical political or military organization. While Mazumdar’s ideology did reign supreme, operational control was actually quite decentralized, with village and district level organizations enjoying almost complete autonomy. This situation utterly precluded the development of any sort of broader economic or social agenda that might have been useful in attracting greater peasant support. In fact, Mazumdar believed that attention devoted to social or economic programs could only detract from the primary goal of seizing political power from the state, and actively discouraged their formulation.69 64 Ghosh, 109. 65 Gupta, 173-174; Jawaid, 95. 66 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 57-59. 67 Gupta, 171. 68 Ghosh, 101. 69 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 58-59. 24 Rather than offering hope, Mazumdar contended that the way to inspire India’s poor was to offer the opportunity for revenge. This accounted for the third pillar of his overall strategy, which he dubbed the “annihilation of class enemies.”70 As the name suggests, this entailed the deliberately brutal murder of jotedars, moneylenders, and agents of the government in an effort to spread “red terror” throughout the countryside.71 With the injunction that “he who has not dipped his hand in the blood of class enemies can hardly be called a communist,” the implementation of this campaign became the primary goal of Naxalite cadres throughout India.72 While it did succeed in driving off the landowning elite in some of the affected areas, the sadistic nature of the killings eventually alienated many more of the peasants than it inspired.73 The tactics that Mazumdar prescribed for the execution of the annihilation strategy were similarly self-defeating. Believing that an obsession with the acquisition of firearms would only distract the peasants from their spontaneous revolutionary zeal, he initially forbade their use by any but the party’s leadership, and even these he limited to purposes of self-defense. In the application of the terror campaign, the cadres were only permitted to use traditional weapons like spears, sickles, and bows and arrows. His emphasis on decentralization also stressed the primacy of village level squads, usually of no more than seven members, at the expense of larger formations of fighters.74 Though he later paid lip service to the need for organizing a ‘People’s Liberation Army’ along more conventional lines, there was never any serious attempt to form such a force.75 These tactical decisions left the Naxalites at a decided disadvantage against the comparatively well armed and organized government security forces that eventually moved in to counter them. 70 Charu Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” Liberation, February 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 290-297. 71 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 45-46. 72 Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” reprinted in Ghosh, 294. 73 Dasgupta. The Naxalite Movement, 58, 64. 74 Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” reprinted in Ghosh, 291. 75 Banerjee, 204-206. 25 For all their operational errors, however, a temporarily accommodating political climate allowed the Naxalites to embark on a series of campaigns that caused no small amount of instability in the regions they affected. From the formation of the party in 1969 until July of 1971, they were a force to be reckoned with in a number of Indian states. 3. Naxalite Activity While Naxalite activity and violence in this period were reported from as far afield as Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, the Punjab, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, the bulk remained confined to West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.76 It was in these two states that the annihilation program was most effectively implemented and where the Naxalites had their greatest political impact. Perhaps surprisingly, the first large-scale campaign after Naxalbari came not in West Bengal, but in Srikakulum district of Andhra Pradesh. Srikakulum’s history of peasant unrest predated the Naxalites, emerging as early as 1961 in the form of agitation by the native Girijan tribals against the economic oppression of the landholding class. While this was usually relatively peaceful, the example and influence of Naxalbari soon turned it violent. By late 1968, under the leadership of a number of imported Naxalite cadres, the Girijans were becoming increasingly militant. In 1969, they embarked on a classic annihilation campaign for political control, killing more than 150 people and eventually extending their writ over more than 500 square miles. While Mazumdar’s hopes were high for this “liberated area,” the movement proved more fragile than it appeared. Coordinated action by the security forces resulted in the deaths or arrests of top Naxalite leaders in the district, and Girijan support for the insurgency dissipated by mid-1970.77 In late 1969, the Naxalites launched another offensive in the Midnapur district of West Bengal. Like Srikakulum, it was a classic annihilation campaign with exclusively 76 Singh, 45-81. 77 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 46-52. 26 political aims. In Midnapur, however, the leadership that instigated the rebellion was not composed of older party cadres, but young students from Calcutta.78 Led by Ashit Chatterjee and Santosh Rana, the movement achieved some early success, accounting for the deaths of around 100 ‘class enemies’ and considerable economic disruption. Like Srikakulum, however, the uprising proved unsustainable and collapsed in the face of pressure from the security forces in early 1970.79 Birbhum in West Bengal, Muzzafarpur in Bihar, and the Palia district of Uttar Pradesh also witnessed organized Naxalite activity in 1969-1970. Like all the other rural uprisings, however, their early intensity masked fundamental weaknesses, and they died out almost as dramatically as they had flared up.80 Ironically, Naxalism’s last major campaign in this period occurred not in the countryside, but in Calcutta. Perhaps in desperation at the failures of its rural campaigns, the CPI-(ML) made an abrupt strategic reversal and launched a “cultural revolution” in West Bengal’s teeming capital in April 1970.81 While some observers have described this surprising development as a spontaneous movement by the urban Naxalite cadres, it is clear that Mazumdar himself guided the emergence of this new front at an early stage. Initially, the focus of the movement was on the destruction of symbols of bourgeoisie culture. These included cinemas, universities, and statues of iconic Indian figures like Mahatma Gandhi. Within a few months, however, the annihilation campaign appeared in Calcutta. Initially targeting police officers, its focus soon shifted to CPI-(M) politicians and activists, and even middle-class businessmen.82 The fact that Naxalite violence had now arrived in a major city occasioned great alarm throughout the country, not least in New Delhi. As the insurgency grew more violent through 1970 and early 1971, however, it became apparent that it was losing its ideological focus. In large part, this was due to a dramatic shift in the makeup of the party’s membership. While upper class university 78 Ghosh, 78-79; Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 57. 79 Singh, 63. 80 Ibid., 64-74. 81 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 68-77. 82 Ibid., 79-91. 27 students had been an important component of the early Naxalite movement, by 1970, most had either been arrested or dropped out in revulsion at the excesses of the annihilation campaign. In their place, shiftless youth, petty criminals, and other anti\u0002social elements had risen to prominence in the urban faction of the CPI-(ML). Under the guise of class struggle, extortion, theft, and personally motivated murders by party cadres grew increasingly common. Unsurprisingly, this did little to endear the Naxalites to the majority of Calcutta society. Already alienated by the statue smashing campaign and other petty vandalism, the public turned decisively against them in 1971.83 As a result of this string of failures, the ideological cracks in the leadership of the CPI-(ML) that had been evident at its founding widened into chasms. Mazumdar was increasingly the target of pointed criticism from other Naxalite leaders on a number of issues.84 Prominent among these were his adoption of the annihilation strategy as the primary form of struggle, his total neglect of the urban proletariat as a target of agitation, and the wisdom of his prohibition of all mass organization - in short, all the tenets of his grand strategy. To make matters worse, he had also lost the rhetorical support of the CPC. In late 1970, the Chinese government sent a message to Mazumdar echoing many of the same criticisms that were emanating from within his own party.85 Shortly thereafter, its radio broadcasts in support of the CPI-(ML) ceased.86 Though still claiming allegiance to Beijing, Mazumdar diverged from the CPC line in 1971 by vocally supporting the uprising in East Pakistan against Yahya Khan’s government. This proved to be the last straw for many other Naxalite leaders, who finally broke ranks with this betrayal of China’s ideological direction.87 With the leadership hopelessly divided, the rural campaign in tatters, and the lumpen-proletariat dominating the urban scene, the 83 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 94-102. 84 Sohail, 45-49. 85 Ghosh, 12-21. 86 Banerjee, 170. 87 Banerjee, 247-248; Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 192-193. 28 Naxalite movement was foundering badly. Nevertheless, it would take concerted action by the central and state governments to definitively put an end to this era of Naxalite activity. D. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 1. Center Responses Initially, the government in New Delhi paid scant attention to the outbreak of violence in Naxalbari. Viewing the situation primarily as a localized law and order problem, it did little more than express its opinion to West Bengal that the situation should be dealt with swiftly.88 To be fair, in spite of the attention it received as a result of the CPC’s endorsement, the early movement was too weak and disorganized to merit much more of a reaction. Even as Naxalism organized and spread through 1968-69, it still failed to elicit much of an official response. As mentioned previously, this was probably due to the distraction provided by the leadership battles and other political machinations that occupied the center during these years. By 1970, however, the situation was beginning to change. The emergence of Naxalite violence in Calcutta, one of India’s largest cities, was too worrisome a development to ignore. On August 11, 1970, Indira Gandhi pronounced that the government would fight the Naxalites with “all the strength at its command.”89 Securing the elections in early 1971 provided a pretext for the deployment of military and paramilitary forces to some of the worst Naxal-affected districts.90 In July 1971, the center launched Operation Steeplechase, a coordinated campaign by the Indian army, the Central Reserve Police Force, and local police across contiguous districts in West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa that were still affected by Naxalite violence. This area encompassed West Bengal’s Midnapur and Birbhum districts, and the cadres still active were largely holdovers from those earlier campaign. While Steeplechase was not a complete success, 88 Ghosh, 37. 89 Singh, 112. 90 Ghosh, xxii. 29 in that a sizeable number of activists escaped the police dragnet, it did achieve some noteworthy results: hundreds of Naxalites were arrested, large caches of weapons were seized, and most importantly, the rural population’s confidence in the strength of the government was restored.91 New Delhi also attempted to undercut the grass-roots appeal of Naxalism by championing a number of rural development and land reform schemes.92 The West Bengal Land Reform Act, passed in January 1970, was one such initiative. It imposed ceilings on the total acreage individual families were allowed to hold and reduced the maximum rent that landlords could charge their sharecroppers. As usual, the law was filled with loopholes, and the ever-present corruption and conflicts of interest severely curtailed its overall efficacy.93 Nevertheless, it did help some of the landless poor and scored political points at the expense of the Naxalites. For all the efforts of the central government, however, Naxal violence remained fundamentally a state problem. India’s Constitution devolved authority over internal security to the states, and it was their policies and initiatives that mattered most.94 Of course, if a state proved incapable of handling its own affairs, there was a constitutional answer for that, too. 2. State Responses In Andhra Pradesh, a determined state government, united under firm Congress Party rule, was able to cope with the violence in Srikakulum on its own. While allegations of police brutality and ‘encounter killings’ were common, the swift and effective application of force by the state police broke the back of the insurgency there in a matter of months.95 The situation in West Bengal was somewhat more complicated. With the CPI-(M) occupying key leadership positions in the United Democratic Front 91 Singh, 99-100. 92 Wolpert 389; Jawaid, 98-100. 93 Jawaid, 86-89. 94 Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Annual Report 2006-07, 1. 95 Ghosh, 84. 30 government, West Bengal’s response to the emergence of Naxalism was initially quite tepid. This was largely due to infighting between the members of the coalition. While other parties argued for a strong response to the initial outbreak of violence in Naxalbari, the CPI-(M) vacillated. Though it wanted to reign in its adventurist cadres in Siliguri, it was fearful of damaging its revolutionary credentials by authorizing too forceful a response. Additionally, the agitators were still members of the CPI-(M) at this stage, and the party was hopeful of bringing them back into its fold. As a result, police actions in response to the increasing violence through July 1967 were quite circumscribed.96 By the time a deteriorating situation forced the government’s hand in August and September, the movement had already attracted a sizeable following. While the insurrection in Naxalbari was effectively put down in a relatively short period of time, the damage had been done. Though the inability of the UDF to effectively govern forced its dissolution in November 1967, mid-term elections returned it to power in February 1969. With broadly the same makeup, it proved even less capable of agreement in policymaking, particularly with respect to the Naxalites. Not only did the government fail to outlaw the movement, some of its constituent parties actually sought to curry favor with the Maoists in a bid to strengthen their popularity with rural voters.97 Again, this resulted in a generally weak security response, with the police budget actually reduced just as the activity in Midnapur and Calcutta was beginning to heat up.98 With the coalition hopelessly polarized and the security situation deteriorating, New Delhi imposed President’s Rule on West Bengal in March 1970. President’s Rule, an administrative device under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, allows the center to assume executive authority in a state if the ruling government can no longer form a majority in the state legislature.99 With the governor 96 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 9. 97 Jawaid, 96-97. 98 Ibid., 73. 99 Government of India, Constitution of India, Ministry of Laws and Justice, http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/welcome.html (accessed December 11, 2007). 31 (as an agent of New Delhi) now firmly in charge, the security situation began to improve rapidly. The 1932 Bengal Suppression of Terrorist Outrage Act was quickly revived, giving the police expanded powers of detention.100 Funding for the state police forces more than doubled, and the number of officers rose dramatically.101 Augmented by personnel from the center’s Border Security Force, these additional men were posted to hotbeds of Naxalite activity, especially Siliguri, Midnapur, and Calcutta. In April, a joint operation by the Indian military and the Central Reserve Police Force, in coordination with state police, successfully put down the Midnapur uprising in a matter of weeks.102 Though it took a while longer, the expanded presence in Calcutta also proved effective. Aided by government sponsored volunteer militias, ironically drawn from the same lumpen-proletariat element the Naxalites had utilized, forceful policing resulted in the deaths or arrest of thousands of Naxalite cadres and sympathizers.103 As in Andhra Pradesh, abuses by the anti-Naxal forces were not uncommon – in one notorious instance, 300 armed members of a volunteer militia rampaged through a Naxalite stronghold in the Cossipore-Baranagore neighborhood of Calcutta, killing nearly 100 suspected Naxalites in cold blood.104 Though brutal, the tactics were effective. By the end of 1971, Mazumdar was forced to officially abandon the urban campaign in the face of mounting losses.105 The movement was by this time a spent force, and its fortunes continued to decline as top leadership was caught up in the tightening police dragnet through the first half of 1972. Finally, on July 16, 1972, Charu Mazumdar himself was arrested from a safe house in the Calcutta suburb of Entally. On July 28, he died in police custody at the age of 54. The death of Mazumdar was a fittingly symbolic denouement to the movement that had burned so brightly for over five years. With the departure of its spiritual and ideological leader, the first phase of Naxalite activity in India was over. 100 Jawaid, 83-84. 101 Ibid., 85. 102 Gupta, 171. 103 Jawaid, 84. 104 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 92. 105 Banerjee, 213. 32 E. CONCLUSION This chapter has analyzed the birth, rise, and eventual decline of the Naxalite insurgency from 1967-1972. The emergence of Naxalism in 1967 was ultimately attributable to a number of factors. Persistent poverty and growing inequality in the countryside produced a groundswell of discontentment in the poor rural population. Deeply frustrated with their government, some peasants and tribals were willing to entertain any alternative ideology that promised empowerment and greater equity; though it was certainly the most violent, Naxalism was just one of a number of socio-political movements that began to emerge at this time.106 Concurrently, political instability brought by the initial weakening of the INC’s hegemony provided room for these alternative ideologies to grow. Finally, leftist revolutionary rhetoric was ubiquitous in the late 1960s, both domestically and internationally. This provided a veneer of ideological sophistication to a movement that offered little more than violence, and allowed it to challenge the state’s legitimacy, at least for a while. However, while the Naxalite movement during this period drew much attention from the press and occasioned a great deal of worry in New Delhi and elsewhere, it seems clear in hindsight that the danger was not as great as many feared at the time. Although Naxalism touched almost every part of the country from 1967-1972, its activities were widely dispersed, and it never controlled more than 200 of India’s 56,000 rural villages at any one time.107 As militant Communism blossomed throughout much of the third world in the late 1960s, it may seem surprising that it failed to gain more traction in the Indian context, beset as it was by many of the same socio-economic problems evident in Southeast Asia or Latin America. In the final analysis, much of the responsibility for the ultimate failure of the Naxalite movement in this period must be laid at the feet of Charu Mazumdar. 106 Some others included movements based on language, caste, and even the rural-urban divide. For a discussion of these phenomena, see: Yadav and Palshikar, 92-96. 107 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 62. 33 The man regarded as ‘India’s Mao Zedong\" proved to be a much less competent leader than his Chinese namesake. Ideologically, his blind application of the Chinese revolutionary model to India overlooked fundamental differences between the two countries. India’s governmental apparatus was much more powerful than its Chinese counterpart had been in the late 1940s. The institution of parliamentary democracy had become well entrenched in India, and it would take more than temporary economic hardships to undermine its widespread support. Additionally, despite its faltering in the elections of 1967, the Congress Party proved to be enduringly popular. The INC was granted an impressive mandate in the 1971 and 1972 elections at both the state and national levels, demonstrating that it retained the support of a majority of the Indian population.108 Therefore, while Mazumdar correctly identified the rising levels of discontent in Indian society, he totally misread the resultant potential for a rapid revolution. The majority of India’s peasants were concerned with local social and economic issues, and remained unmoved by Naxalite political ideology. As it turned out, most of Mazumdar’s strategic and operational initiatives actually proved counterproductive in winning over India’s masses. His single-minded focus on the seizure of political power and utter contempt for mass organization precluded the development of any socio-economic agenda that might have been useful in garnering broad rural support. While this was supposed to be achieved through the application of the annihilation campaign, the brutality of this program actually alienated the majority of peasants. When it was extended to urban areas during the Calcutta campaign, it had the same effect on most city residents; the ill-conceived “cultural revolution” and the excesses of the lumpen-proletariat faction only exacerbated this revulsion. In the end, Mazumdar’s strategic choices effectively denied his movement any base of popular support. Nor did he better acquit himself in his tactical formulations. The curious prohibition on firearms left his cadres woefully outgunned by the military and police. Additionally, his penchant for decentralization severely restricted the Naxalites’ ability to 108 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 229-231; Wolpert, 389. 34 adapt to changing military circumstances. Even as the scale of the government’s security operations grew from 1967-1972, the Maoists continued to emphasize small, village-level units at the expense of a more sizeable and coherent military organization. Time and again, these proved incapable of mounting an effective resistance to the larger, better equipped, and more highly organized forces arrayed against them. While Mazumdar’s inept leadership set the stage for the movement’s demise, the overall effectiveness of the government’s response must also be acknowledged. With the exception of the UDF initiatives in West Bengal, robust and forceful responses by state and central security forces were eventually successful in putting down all the uprisings. While these did involve a number of human rights abuses, the growing public disgust with Naxalite violence meant that most Indians seemed to accept these aggressive policing methods.109 Simultaneously, all levels of government increased funding for land reforms and rural development programs in an effort to address the socio-economic inequities that had helped spark the outbreak of violence. While these did not always work as they were intended, they did succeed in winning back the support of the rural poor. The final contributor to the failure of the Naxalite movement in this period was its overall organizational weakness. Mazumdar’s charismatic personality had papered over the movement’s fissiparous tendencies in 1967, but these forces could not be contained for long. Ideological differences and powerful egos erupted again in late 1970, and the leadership had irrevocably fractured by 1972. The CPI-(ML) splintered into a number of different factions, including the Maoist Communist Centre, the Proletarian Party, and a grouping of the CPI-(ML)’s Regional Committees of West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.110 Along with Dakshin Desh and the Nagi Reddy Group, these localized, weakened, and divided organizations would be the diminished face of Naxalism through its next period of activity, 1972-1991. 109 Gupta, 173 110 Jawaid, 94. 35 III. THE FRAGMENTARY PERIOD (1972-1991) A. INTRODUCTION In 1972, the Naxalites emerged from the failures and setbacks at the end of the Organizational Period in a critically weakened state: their founder and most influential leader, Charu Mazumdar, was dead; their surviving leadership was rotting in jail after a brutally effective government crackdown; their activists were disillusioned and demoralized after a succession of defeats; and the excesses of revolutionary zeal had alienated them from the vast majority of the Indian public. Given this litany of woes, most observers could be forgiven for assuming that the movement was as good as dead. As it turned out, the flame ignited at Naxalbari had not extinguished – it was, however, reduced to a smoldering ember that was very nearly snuffed out over the course of the next two decades.111 The years from 1972-1991 unquestionably marked the nadir of the Naxalite movement in India. Battered by the government’s security forces in the previous period, it desperately needed to reunify and consolidate its position. Instead, it was repeatedly fragmented by disagreements over ideological abstractions, strategic formulations, and even personal egos. The result was a proliferation of small, localized groups that proved utterly incapable of mounting any effective challenge to the Indian government. In short, the story of the Naxalites in this period is a rather boring one compared to the events of 1965-1972. It is, nonetheless, one worth examining. For the purposes of analyzing Naxalism’s resurgence after 1991, this period is important on three counts. First, it acted as a bridge between the two periods of relatively high Naxalite activity. Secondly, it gave rise to the factions that turned into the dominant Naxalite groups of the current era; clearly, any study of these organizations must take into account the circumstances of their birth. Lastly, determining the reasons for the movement’s inability to gain traction in the past should help in prescribing effective ways to counter its spread in future. 111 This analogy is borrowed, with appreciation, from Prakash Singh’s The Naxalite Movement in India. 36 B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments The 1970s and 80s were a transitional period in Indian politics. The instability of 1965-1971, discussed in the preceding chapter, was the first indication that the institution of one-party hegemony known as the ‘Congress System’ was not as unshakeable as it had previously appeared.112 Though Indira’s party enjoyed landslide victories at the state and national levels in 1971 and 1972, successfully consolidating the INC and the country under the banner of her leadership, this apparent return to the stability of the old ‘Congress system’ belied a number of emerging structural changes in the Indian polity. Chief among these were the increasing politicization of lower and middle classes and castes, the rising importance of local-level issues, and the resultant emergence of regional and state level parties. While these processes evolved gradually, they set the stage for the tremendous changes that would occur on the Indian political scene in the 1990s, and helped make politics in these two decades more complex than it had been in the past. Though a thorough examination of these phenomena is outside the scope of this thesis, they indirectly impacted the course of Naxalism in a number of ways.113 One was through political developments in New Delhi. As previously alluded, Congress (I) emerged in 1972 with firm control of the national government. In light of the changing political scene, the party was remarkably effective in maintaining its grip on power for the remainder of this period, only relinquishing it during two brief interludes of Janata Party-led coalition government, in 1977-1980 and 1989-1991. In retrospect, this success was largely due to Indira’s political guile and capacity for heavy-handed authoritarianism. Recognizing that anti-colonial nationalism was no longer an effective rallying cry for the masses, she sought to mobilize support by turning to a more populist 112 Rajni Kothari, “The Congress ‘System’ in India,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 58-70. 113 For an excellent examination of structural changes in Indian politics during this period, see: Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952- 2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 73-113. 37 message.114 Though Congress remained the party of India’s industrial classes, it also began to reemphasize its socialist roots. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, agricultural development, poverty reduction, and economic self-sufficiency featured prominently in Congress’ platform, successfully attracting significant portions of the lower classes and castes.115 This shift in message did more than win elections – it also boosted the government’s legitimacy with India’s poor, thereby undercutting the appeal of alternative ideologies like Naxalism. When rhetoric proved insufficient in maintaining Congress hegemony, however, the party was not averse to taking more extreme measures. The imposition of the ‘Emergency’ from June 1975 to March 1977 demonstrated this most strikingly. Faced with declining popularity and a series of legal challenges to her rule, Mrs. Gandhi temporarily abrogated the constitution, suspended all civil rights, jailed opposition political figures, and instituted martial law throughout the country.116 Though democracy and the rule of law were reinstated with the national elections in 1977, Indira, and the Congress Party more generally, showed themselves more than willing to deal harshly with political opposition. As we will see, this resulted in a usually muscular response to separatist movements and other insurrections, including those of the Naxalite groups. Developments at the state level were also important. Throughout the early 1970s and the period of the Emergency, Congress governments retained power in the vast majority of the Indian states. However, after the INC’s temporary defeat at the center in 1977, the number and influence of state-level parties accelerated dramatically. Significantly, this phenomenon began in those areas most affected by Naxalism during the previous period, with the emergence of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh and the resurgence of the CPI-(M) in West Bengal.117 The growth of these parties, many of which depended on tenant farmers and landless laborers for their 114 Yadav and Palshikar, 96. 115 Wolpert, 389-410. 116 Ibid., 398-399. 117 Yadav and Palshikar, 106-112. 38 primary constituencies, gave a new political voice to groups that had been effectively disenfranchised in the past. Their inclusion in the political process helped keep rural unrest in check and brought an added impetus for meaningful action on economic issues that were dear to this large demographic. 2. Economic Developments India’s economy during this period was something of a mixed bag. At the macro level, Congress’ socialist policies, the persistence of an overbearing public sector epitomized by the ‘License Raj’ and a strategy of import-substitution industrialization introduced significant distortions in the economy that stifled growth the country so desperately needed. While overall GDP increased at an average of 3.5 percent throughout the 1970s, an exploding population meant the corresponding rate per capita was only 1.3 percent, far below that of the rest of the developing world. Though tepid attempts at liberalization resulted in slightly higher growth rates in the 1980s, their incomplete nature resulted in a balance of payments crisis that ultimately proved unsustainable and precipitated the economic reforms of the 1990s.118 On the other hand, the benefits of the Green Revolution were finally becoming more evenly distributed, and Congress’ newfound political populism translated into a slew of rural and agricultural development initiatives and aid programs.119 For the country’s poor farmers at least, the picture was finally becoming a bit brighter. Indira’s initial reforms after the 1971 elections were ambitious in scope and included land-reform legislation, rural employment programs, nationalization of food markets, and investment in transportation infrastructure designed to help farmers get their product to market. These were consolidated in the country’s Fifth Five Year Plan, launched in 1974, the explicit aims of which were the “removal of poverty” and the “attainment of economic self-reliance.” For all its optimism, the plan’s designs were complicated by the same corruption and conflicts of interest that had plagued reform efforts in previous eras. Additionally, the worldwide oil shocks of the early 1970s 118 Gurcharan Das, “The India Model,” Foreign Affairs 85, no. 4 (July/August 2006): 4-5. 119 Wolpert, 387-388; Jawaid, 100-102. 39 brought massive inflation that substantially diminished economic growth in real terms. Bihar and Gujarat erupted in riots and protests at the diminishing economic situation, and a national railroad strike threatened to bring the country to a standstill and compound its economic problems.120 Though political factors contributed more directly to the imposition of the Emergency in 1975, Indira used her newfound power to tackle the economic challenges facing the country. Her ‘Twenty-Point Program’ of economic development was very similar to the country’s Fifth Five Year Plan, but with political opposition sidelined, Mrs. Gandhi was able to force its implementation more effectively.121 For all its authoritarianism, the Program was remarkably successful in getting the economic situation under control and finally bringing some relief to farmers and the rural poor. Inflation was successfully tamed, food prices retreated to their 1971 levels, and agricultural investment and subsidies began reaching the people that truly needed them.122 When the Emergency was repealed and the Janata government came to power in 1977, the coalition proved so weak and the government so ineffectual that economic problems returned almost immediately. Inflation and unemployment skyrocketed, and Congress returned to power in 1980 with the slogan “Elect a Government that Works!”123 Though she initially tried to cut agricultural subsidies, the political backlash convinced Indira and her party that the rural interests would still have to be placated. The Sixth Five Year Plan brought numerous anti-poverty initiatives like the Integrated Rural Development Program and the National Rural Employment Program, and inaugurated huge agricultural subsidies that continued throughout the 1980s.124 In sum, while overall economic performance throughout this period was relatively mediocre, the numerous development initiatives meant the plight of the rural poor ceased to deteriorate as it had 120 Wolpert, 396-397. 121 Ibid., 400. 122 Ibid., 403. 123 Ibid., 407-410. 124 Banerjee, 293. 40 from 1965-1972. In fact, the rural poverty rate declined relatively dramatically over this period, from 56% in 1973 to only 39% by 1988.125 This is not to imply that these programs were unqualified successes; corruption and conflicts of interest continued to hamper their implementation, and their benefits were far from uniformly distributed. Nevertheless, they were successful enough to alleviate some of the income disparities that had stoked the fires of Naxalism in the previous period, and diminished economic and class issues as a source of social unrest.126 3. Social Developments Despite the attenuation of economic inequity as a source of social strife, the 1970s and ‘80s witnessed the birth of new ethnic and religious cleavages in India’s heterogeneous society, precipitating the rise of a number of new communal and secessionist movements. Though none of these were directly connected to the phenomenon of Naxalism, their emergence and the government’s response did have implications for the Maoists’ fortunes. Two of the most prominent of these movements occurred in the Punjab and India’s wild Northeast. In the late 1970s, a wave of unrest swept India’s ‘Seven Sisters,’ the small and predominantly tribal states east of the Siliguri corridor. While the trouble started in response to an influx of Bengali refugees in the wake of the 1971 Indo-Pak War, it soon took on a distinctly separatist character.127 Historically, the region had only the loosest association with the rest of the subcontinent and was much more culturally bound to neighboring areas of Burma than to the rest of India. By the early 1980s, the Assamese, Bodo, Naga, and Mizo peoples had launched a series of violent secessionist movements, many of which continue to the present day. In response, New Delhi imposed martial law and dispatched the military and central police forces to put down the rebellions.

The Sikh community had agitated for a separate Sikh nation, notionally known as Khalistan, since around the time of Partition and Independence in 1947. The movement had been largely peaceful in the intervening decades, but by the late 1970s, it was becoming more belligerent. Under the leadership of J. S. Bhindranwale, a Sikh religious guru, armed members of the separatist Akali Dal Party stormed the Golden Temple at Amritsar in a direct challenge to New Delhi’s authority. In response to the rising violence and lawlessness throughout the Punjab, Indira’s actions were swift and uncompromising. In June of 1984, the Indian Army launched ‘Operation Bluestar,’ retaking the Golden Temple by force and inflicting massive casualties on its Sikh defenders.129 The operation cost Mrs. Gandhi her life (she was shortly thereafter assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards) and did not end the Khalistan movement immediately. It did, however, set the tone for the center’s response through the remainder of the decade.130 Extremely aggressive security actions continued, and ultimately proved successful in putting down the insurrection by the early 1990s. For the Naxalites, the impact of unrest in the Punjab and the Northeast was twofold. First, it seems likely that the threats to the integrity of the nation served to rally significant portions of the electorate to the government, giving New Delhi an added source of legitimacy. Much as the government enjoyed a boost of popularity in 1971-72 during the Indo-Pak war, the actions against the animist tribals and (especially) the Sikhs played well with India’s majority Hindu polity.131 This doubtlessly helped curtail the popularity of an anti-government ideology like Naxalism. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the aggressive response to each of these movements presented a daunting 128 Wolpert, 425-426. 129 Ibid., 416-418. 130 Ibid., 423-425. 131 Ibid., 418. 42 challenge to any other would-be troublemakers. As historian Stanley Wolpert notes, “The stunning, shocking violence of Operation Bluestar served to put every minority in India on immediate notice of just how dangerous continued opposition to Delhi could be.”132 The Naxalites could certainly be included as one of these minority groups. As we shall see, however, the most potent enemy of Naxalism in this period was the internal disarray of the movement itself. C. INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NAXALITE INSURGENCY 1. Organization and Leadership Following the death of Charu Mazumdar in 1972, the Naxalites underwent a process of fragmentation that severely crippled the movement over the ensuing decades. Though their total numbers stayed relatively steady, with most estimates in the neighborhood of 15,000 activists nationwide, the leadership was increasingly driven by ideological and operational differences of opinion.133 While the failures of the previous period were the immediate catalyst for this phenomenon, the movement had displayed factionalist tendencies almost from its inception. At the organizational meetings of the AICCCR in 1969, two groups parted ways with the nascent CPI-(ML) from the outset. The first of these was the Andhra faction of Naxalites under the leadership of Nagi Reddy. Reddy differed with Mazumdar’s formulations on a number of points, most crucially the blanket ban on elections and the single-minded emphasis on the annihilation strategy at the expense of economic struggles and mass organization.134 After being disaffiliated from the AICCCR, Reddy formed his own organization in 1969, the Andhra Pradesh Revolutionary Communist Committee (APRCC). While the APRCC was initially larger than the CPI-(ML), Reddy’s arrest in late 1969 severely curtailed its activities.135 In the 1970s, the APRCC broke up into a 132 Wolpert, 418. 133 New York Times, “Maoist Extremists Reappear in India,” October 12, 1980. 134 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 154-156. 135 Ibid., 34. 43 number of smaller organizations, the two most significant of which were the Unity Center of Communist Revolutionaries of India (UCCRI) led by Nagi Reddy himself and Chandra Pulla Reddy’s Revolutionary Communist Center (RCC).136 While both groups were marginally active in Andhra Pradesh through the 1970s, they underwent numerous splits themselves in the latter half of the decade. By 1990, these smaller groups had either withered to inconsequence or been absorbed by other Naxalite outfits. The other faction that split from the AICCCR in 1969 was known as Dakshin Desh. Its leaders, Amulya Sen and Kanai Chatterjee, also disagreed with Mazumdar over the necessity of mass organization and established their own group, initially based in West Bengal. With the government crackdowns of 1970-71, Dakshin Desh moved its operations to Bihar, changing its name to the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) in 1975.137 Though relatively small, the MCC remained a more or less coherent organization over the course of these two decades. The same could certainly not be said for Charu Mazumdar’s CPI-(ML). The party had always been a relatively fragile construct of disparate personalities and ideologies, but after the setbacks of 1971-1972, it underwent a dizzying process of fractionalization that resulted in the emergence of literally dozens of competing groups. As the smaller organizations were often short-lived and of little real significance in the future development of the movement, only the most important will be enumerated here. Following Mazumdar’s death in 1972, the CPI-(ML) split into two broad camps: those who supported his ideology, strategy, and tactics, and those who opposed them. The pro-Mazumdar camp was further divided in 1973, with Lin Biao’s fall from grace in the Chinese Communist Party. A source of great inspiration for Mazumdar’s ideology, his disavowal by the Chinese generated contentious ideological debate within this branch of Naxalism.138 The pro-Mazumdar/pro-Lin Biao faction, a distinct minority, regrouped in West Bengal under the leadership of Mahadev Mukherjee.139 The pro-Mazumdar/anti- 136 Banerjee, 166, 298. 137 Prakash Singh, 115-116. 138 Banerjee, 246. 139 Ghosh, 175-177. 44 Lin Biao faction emerged in Bihar as CPI-(ML) Liberation, and in Andhra Pradesh as the Central Organizing Committee CPI-(ML), or COC-(ML).140 The COC-(ML) would itself split in 1977, with one faction, led by Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, reestablishing itself in 1980 as CPI-(ML) People’s War Group, or PWG, in Andhra Pradesh.141 Among the anti-Mazumdar camp, the shakeout in this period was somewhat less confusing. The largest group emerged under the leadership of Satyanarayan Singh, the erstwhile Secretary of the CPI-(ML)’s Bihar State Committee. Singh had fallen out with Mazumdar in late 1971 over the latter’s authoritarian tendencies and seemingly suicidal tactical injunctions. In November of that year, Singh and a number of similarly disenchanted leaders formed a parallel leadership and actually expelled Mazumdar from his own party.142 Though most of the Naxalite rank-and-file did not initially accept this, Singh attracted a sizeable following after Mazumdar’s passing. His organization, known as CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh, was the largest and most influential of the post-Mazumdar Naxalite groups in the 1970s.143 The only other sizeable anti-Mazumdar group to emerge was Bihar’s CPI-(ML) Unity Committee, led by Khokan Mazumdar (no relation to Charu). In 1982, this group merged with the Bihar faction of the COC-(ML) to form the CPI-(ML) Party Unity, with Naveen Prasad as its new leader.144 While the proliferation of groups in this period might give an impression of vitality, the splintering of the movement was actually indicative of a great deal of uncertainty and acrimony in the ranks. While all still agreed on the need for a Maoist\u0002inspired political revolution in the country, Mazumdar’s death and the fallout from the failures of the 1965-1972 period had left the Naxalites confused and quarrelsome, on issues both practical and ideological. Cries of ‘revisionism’ by one group were answered with counteraccusations of ‘left-adventurism’ from another. The resultant infighting left 140 Prakash Singh, 156; Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 22. 141 Prakash Singh, 130. 142 Ghosh, 139-144, 151. 143 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 10. 144 Prakash Singh, 159-160. 45 the cadres demoralized and the leadership even more hopelessly divided.145 Perhaps no issue generated more contention than the most appropriate strategy to pursue in the post\u0002Mazumdar era. 2. Strategy and Tactics Following the security crackdowns in 1971-72, most of the Naxalite groups initially continued to advocate a violent strategy. With the memories of government repression fresh in their minds, this was not altogether surprising – most of their leaders continued to languish in prison, often under harsh conditions. Dakshin Desh and the pro\u0002Lin Biao faction in West Bengal were particularly vociferous in their agitation for a continuation of the annihilation policy. The other groups placed more rhetorical emphasis on building up mass organizations, but they too were initially unwilling to forswear armed struggle against the hated oppressors.146 However, with the end of the Emergency and the rise of the first Janata government, a more moderate position began to emerge within a key segment of the Naxalite movement. The CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh was the first major organization to change tack. Negotiating with Janata politicians from his jail cell after the 1977 elections, Singh’s aversion to electoral politics and compromise with the state softened. In a surprise move, he released a press statement in April 1977 expressing his “critical support” for the new Janata government and vowing that his group would participate in the assembly elections of June of that year.147 The formerly staunch advocate of the annihilation strategy went so far as to announce, “We wish to state categorically here that violence is not our ideology. Our ideology is Marxism-Leninism.”148 Though he justified this ideological reversal on the grounds that it would secure the release of political prisoners and enable the Maoists to present their platform to more of the population than ever before, his move 145 Jawaid, 94-95. 146 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 11. 147 Ibid., 14. 148 Prakash Singh, 121-122. 46 was viewed as treason by the rest of the movement.149 However, when the Janata government delivered on its promises of clemency and one of Singh’s candidates was actually elected in West Bengal (Santosh Rana, formerly the leader of the Midnapur uprising), his approach was vindicated in the eyes of many Naxalites. Even such old\u0002school stalwarts as Kanu Sanyal and Ashim Chatterjee eventually gave Singh’s strategy their grudging endorsement.150 Throughout the rest of the 1970s and 80s, CPI-(ML) Liberation and various lesser organizations followed the CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh’s lead and slowly moderated their stance. To be sure, it took time for the incidences of violence to diminish, and many of these groups stressed that they still retained the option of armed revolution.151 Nevertheless, they increasingly normalized their activities, allying themselves with leftist political parties and contesting elections at the state level through front organizations in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal.152 For other groups, however, rapprochement with any government forces, whatever their political stripes, remained anathema. The MCC, COC-(ML), and CPI-(ML) Unity Committee acknowledged the need for a greater emphasis on mass organization, but only in support of armed agrarian revolution.153 The latter two organizations splintered in the late 1970s, but their descendants carried on their two-pronged strategy of mass mobilization and violent opposition in the subsequent decade. Both the PWG and Party Unity continued the killing of jotedars and other class enemies, but not as single-mindedly as the CPI-(ML) had in the past. They also established aboveground organizations to agitate for land reform and minimum wages, and began setting up parallel administrations to dispense justice and other government functions that were lacking in the remote areas where they operated.154 Interestingly, the PWG was also able to attract some support by waging a 149 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 14-15. 150 Prakash Singh, 123. 151 Ibid., 158. 152 Tilak, 19-20; Prakash Singh, 123. 153 Prakash Singh, 123. 154 Ibid., 133-134. 47 campaign against social vice in the villages, which included crusades against drunkenness, gambling, and prostitution.155 Despite their avowed commitment to a similarly multi-pronged approach, the MCC was generally less successful in these secondary endeavors. During the 1980s, the group was best known for the gruesome nature of its continuing annihilations, still directed primarily at upper caste landlords.156 At the tactical level, those groups espousing violence began implementing more realistic methods in their continued pursuit of armed revolution. Discarding the Charuist aversion to modern weaponry, most actively encouraged the capture of guns from jotedars and police.157 While this slowly improved the Naxalites’ firepower, their operations remained dominated by small squad-level actions, and were generally unsophisticated in terms of their planning and execution. In the late 1980s, the PWG did receive some training from LTTE rebels in more advanced tactics, including the use of explosives. This enabled them to successfully carry out a land-mine attack against police forces in 1989, providing a deadly portent of things to come.158 For the most part, however, major improvements in the Maoists’ operational capabilities would not come until well into the next decade. 3. Naxalite Activity As fundamental as it was, the split between those groups that followed the Singh line of political normalization and those that continued with the strategy of violence was just one of a host of divisions that spread like a cancer through the movement. Even groups on the same side of the strategic divide remained pitted against one another over issues of personality or ideology, and fratricide was not uncommon.159 In this contentious environment, there was little hope of consolidation or cooperation. Split as 155 Prakash Singh, 137-138. 156 Ibid., 151-153. 157 Ibid., 136 , 151. 158 Ibid., 140-141. 159 Ibid., 155. 48 they were into numerous smaller groupings, the Naxalites’ activity in this period was generally circumscribed and remained restricted to a few small geographic areas. Throughout the early and mid-1970s, a combination of effective security efforts and the imprisonment of most of the leadership put a stop to almost all violent Naxalite activity. Indeed, brief periods of unrest were recorded in only two places: northern West Bengal and Bhojpur district in Bihar. The agitation in West Bengal erupted in 1973, led by the pro-Mazumdar/pro-Lin Biao faction of Mahadev Mukherjee. For about a year, actions against police forces resulted in several dozen deaths and the seizure of a similar number of firearms, but the uprising fizzled with Mukherjee’s arrest towards the end of 1974.160 The activity in Bhojpur was slightly longer lived, lasting from 1972-1977, and was led by CPI-(ML) Liberation. Still committed to violent revolution at this stage, the group carried out a number of annihilations against class enemies with the support of local tribes. Still, the uprising was a small-scale affair, accounting for only around ninety deaths over the entire five-year period, with its longevity due more to the state government’s anemic response than the actual strength of the insurgency. Like its counterpart in West Bengal, it was put down relatively easily with the introduction of more aggressive security measures, this time from the center.161 The late 1970s witnessed the dramatic announcements of Satyanarayan Singh and the political normalization of a number of Naxalite groups. Though gradual, this proved to be an enduring phenomenon, and the CPI-(ML) S.N.Singh and its followers largely retreated from violent activities. Though still active politically, their strategic course change effectively removed them from the Naxalite fold by the early 1980s, at least for the purposes of this thesis. As for the more recalcitrant Maoists, two dozen smaller groups remained minimally active in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and a number of southern states.162 Between them all, however, they accounted for only a handful of incidents and even fewer deaths. Throughout the 1980s, the only groups of 160 Ghosh, 175-177. 161 Prakash Singh, 117-119. 162 Ibid., 124. 49 any real significance were the PWG in Andhra Pradesh, and what the Indian security official Prakash Singh dubbed the ‘New Left’ in Bihar.163 Formed in April 1980 by Kandapalli Seetharamaiah, the PWG quickly became the most powerful Naxalite organization in the country. Though this latter fact was admittedly not much of a boast during this period, they were a disruptive influence in their primary area of operations, the perennially restive and underdeveloped Telangana region.164 While the group did engage in rudimentary social projects and set up a number of peasant organizations to help mobilize the masses in pursuit of economic goals, Seetharamaiah was also a firm believer in Mazumdar’s annihilation strategy. As Table 1 shows, the group grew increasingly violent under his leadership, with attacks on jotedars, police, and police informants.165 Though still relatively contained by the end of the 1980s, the PWG was already demonstrating the bloody ruthlessness that would distinguish it in later decades. The ‘New Left’ in Bihar emerged at roughly the same time as the PWG. Comprised of the MCC, Party Unity, and CPI-(ML) Liberation, the title may give a misleading impression of cooperation amongst the groups. In reality, they fought each other nearly as often as they engaged ‘class enemies,’ often in petty squabbles over turf or ideological nuances. 163 Prakash Singh, 124. 164 Ibid., 129-141. 165 Ibid., 140 YEAR INCIDENTS KILLED 1981 53 10 1982 98 18 1983 172 17 1984 306 30 1985 308 30 1986 161 25 1987 252 63 1988 453 59 1989 456 84 1990 735 94 Table 1. Naxalite Violence in Andhra Pradesh 50 Nevertheless, they too managed to make an impact at the state level. Like Telangana, Bihar remained beyond the reach of many of the government’s reform initiatives, and pockets of rural unrest continued to provide havens for Naxalite cadres.166 Though Liberation was the largest of the three groups, its gradual embrace of electoral politics over the course of the decade made it the least violently active. It maintained an armed wing into the 1990s, but its aboveground political organization, the Indian People’s Front, increasingly supplanted the influence of its more belligerent cadres.167 The faction favoring normalization gained dominance in 1992, and Liberation thereafter functioned primarily as an aboveground outfit, focused almost exclusively on peaceful mass organization.168 In a telling signal of the extent of their moderation, its leaders even called for rapprochement with the formerly despised CPI and CPI-(M), in an effort to build a more coordinated leftist political front.169 By contrast, the MCC and Party Unity remained exclusively committed to armed revolution. Mass organization was desirable, but in the context of a burgeoning caste conflict in the state during this period, often difficult to mobilize along exclusively class lines. Instead, the annihilation strategy was pursued with a decidedly grisly purpose, particularly by the MCC. In most cases, upper caste jotedars and their families were the primary targets but, with the conflation of caste and class conflicts in the state, the sadistic nature of the killings failed to generate the same backlash that had occurred previously. As a result, both the MCC and Party Unity were able to carve out small areas of influence in Bihar over the latter half of the 1980s.170 As in Andhra Pradesh, however, this level of activity remained a far cry from that of 1967-1972. 166 Prakash Singh, 148-160. 167 Tilak, 19. 168 Prakash Singh, 158. 169 Tilak, 20. 170 Prakash Singh, 148-156, 159-160. 51 D. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 1. Center Responses From the halls of power in New Delhi, Naxalism appeared to be a spent force after 1972. With the center caught up in the drama of systemic political change and the growth of ethnic secessionist movements over these two decades, relatively scant attention was paid to the fractured and localized Maoist movement in the country. Nevertheless, as alluded in Section 3.2, developments at the national level did have an impact on the Naxalites. With the INC’s turn to a more populist platform, new rural development and land reform initiatives effectively undercut the movement’s base of support. With rural inequality receding rather than growing, the more militant cadres had a much harder time finding sympathetic base areas from which to operate. Even for those sections of the movement that drifted in a more moderate direction, the government’s schemes were successful in stealing their rhetorical thunder and foiling most attempts at mass organization; Naxalite candidates did not generally have much success at the polls, Santosh Rana’s success notwithstanding.171 While these developments posed indirect problems for the Naxalites, a much more immediate challenge emerged with the imposition of the Emergency in 1975. Though not primarily directed at the Naxalites, the resultant political and security crackdowns hit the movement hard. Like most other opposition groups, all Naxalite organizations were banned and scores of leaders and party activists rearrested under the newly instituted Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA).172 Among them were some of the Maoists’ most effective organizers, including Kanu Sanyal, Ashim Chatterjee, and Satyanarayan Singh. Moreover, the security forces were given wide latitude in dealing with whatever opposition escaped the prison cell. Frequently, this entailed direct action like that of ‘Operation Thunder,’ which crushed the long-simmering 171 Prakash Singh, 211-212. 172 Banerjee, 297. 52 unrest in Bhojpur with combined operations by the military and Central Reserve Police forces in 1977.173 Already in tatters after Mazumdar’s death, the Naxalite movement was nearly destroyed by the center’s expanded powers during the Emergency.174 Ironically, it was also New Delhi that granted it a new lease on life. The Janata government’s promises to undo the excesses of the Emergency resulted in the release of hundreds of Naxalite prisoners all across the country in 1977 and 1978, the legalization of most of their organizations, and the easing of pressure by government security forces.175 While this ultimately had the effect of moderating several factions and co\u0002opting them into the political process, it also freed the more hard-core cadres to resume their subversive activities. Though the INC returned to power in New Delhi in 1980, it did not resume its previous activities against the Naxalites. In part, this was due to the still extremely weak state of the movement. More importantly, however, the government already had its hands full with the growing unrest in Punjab and the Northeast. Nevertheless, the center’s security initiatives with respect to these other regions reverberated among the Naxalites. The extremely aggressive response to these insurgencies likely helped convince the more moderate Maoists that the path of armed rebellion was untenable and provided some deterrent effect even to their more violent-minded brethren. Whatever the case, Naxalite violence remained at a sufficiently low ebb through the 1980s to permit the central government to largely dismiss it as a local law and order problem. The same could not necessarily be said for those states that were more directly affected. 2. State Responses As the birthplace of Naxalism, West Bengal had the longest history in dealing with the insurgency. While effective policing put down the 1973-74 uprising of Mahadev Mukherjee’s faction, rural unrest continued to simmer under a series of Congress administrations. When a Left Front coalition government returned to power in 1977, 173 Prakash Singh, 119. 174 Mehra, 51-52. 175 Prakash Singh, 122; Tilak, 12. 53 however, the situation changed dramatically. Led by the CPI-(M), the new administration proved much more competent and enduring than its predecessors. Under its direction, West Bengal instituted a series of land redistribution and rural development initiatives that proved remarkably successful. One of these was ‘Operation Barga,’ which established strict ceilings on total landholdings by individuals and granted inheritable ownership rights to tenant farmers and sharecroppers.176 Unencumbered by the political compromises, conflicts of interest, and enforcement issues that so often plagued center\u0002led efforts, these state-level reforms removed the Maoists’ raison d’etre in a few short years. By the early 1980s, Naxalism had ceased to be a force of any consequence in the state.177 Though not as successful as West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh was able to mount an intermittently effective counter to its Naxalite problem. The TDP, which came to power in 1983, initially pursued a policy of appeasement with the PWG in an effort to lure them to peace talks. When it became clear that the group had no intention of negotiating in good faith (and had, in fact, used the opportunity to consolidate and strengthen their positions), the state’s Chief Minister, N.T. Rama Rao, adopted a hard line against the Naxalites.178 Rao authorized aggressive policing measures against PWG cadres and oversaw the formation of the Greyhounds, the state’s elite anti-Naxal police unit, in the late 1980s.179 Though he supported aggressive security measures, Rao did not neglect the rural development initiatives that had proved so successful in West Bengal. Land reform and rural employment initiatives were implemented with moderate success, but a lack of government infrastructure in remoter parts of the state made their implementation there difficult.180 In 1989, the INC returned to power in state elections, but initially made the same early mistakes as the TDP. The new Chief Minister, Chenna Reddy, tried to 176 Prakash Singh, 179. 177 Mehra, 56; Prakash Singh, 236. 178 Prakash Singh, 139. 179 Andhra Pradesh State Police, “Units: Greyhounds,” http://www.apstatepolice.org/AboutUs/units/units_greyhounds.htm (accessed February 4, 2008). 180 K.C. Suri, “Telugu Desam Party,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 294-295. 54 appease the PWG in a vain attempt to lure them into the mainstream, releasing several hundred Naxalite prisoners rounded up under the previous administration.181 When this approach failed again, Reddy reverted to Rao’s combination of tough policing and socio\u0002economic development. Despite these ups and downs, the state was relatively successful in confining the PWG to the Telangana region and a few neighboring districts throughout the 1980s. By contrast, the containment of the MCC and Party Unity in Bihar had little to do with the state government. The Janata Party captured control of the state briefly, from 1977 to 1980, but the remainder of this period was dominated by INC administrations. In reality, however, it scarcely mattered who controlled the government. Corruption, cronyism, and maladministration took root in Bihar in the 1970s and continued to flourish through the 1980s.182 Unable to mount effective security or development initiatives of any kind, the government essentially left the rural parts of the state to their own devices, providing space for the embers of Naxalism to smolder. While the growth of caste conflict in the state, as well as internecine fighting between the MCC and PU, were enough to keep the Naxalites more or less in check during these decades, the state’s appallingly poor governance would become an issue in the future resurgence of Naxalism. E. CONCLUSION The Fragmentary Period was a prolonged low point in the history of Naxalism in India. After its brief but significant surge from 1967 to 1972, the movement underwent a period of stagnation and decay that lasted nearly two decades and effectively removed it from the public consciousness. Though not as captivating a story as the vitality of the previous period, the impotence of the movement and its singular inability to gain traction during these years are still worthy of examination. 181 Sanjoy Hazarika, “Indian Rebel Group is Linked to Train Attack,” New York Times, October 21, 1990. 182 Prakash Singh, 148-150. 55 The most obvious reason for the failure of Naxalism in this period was its own organizational weakness. Fractured into dozens of smaller, competing factions, it was too dispersed and fragmented to mount any kind of meaningful challenge to the forces of the Indian state. In large part, this was a failure of leadership. Consumed by their personal egos, strategic and tactical differences, and ideological arguments incomprehensible to any but the most dogmatic Marxists, the heads of the various Naxalite organizations were utterly incapable of resolving their disputes and coordinating the activities of their disparate groups. As a consequence, a large portion of the movement effectively abandoned the revolutionary line, and those that remained were confined to a few small pockets of activity in the hinterlands. With the structure of the movement in such a state, its success would have been unlikely in even a permissive security environment. As it turned out, the security environment was decidedly unfavorable. The imposition of the Emergency in the 1970s granted the state a great deal of leeway in dealing with opposition movements, and it used them to devastating affect against the already fragmented Naxalites. Indeed, the movement was very nearly destroyed by policing actions like Operation Thunder and the imprisonment of hundreds, if not thousands of its activists. The situation in the 1980s was hardly any better. Though New Delhi’s aggressive reactions to the various secessionist uprisings in the country were not directed against the Maoists, they still provided a powerful deterrent effect. Lastly, the social, economic, and political conditions in the country were not conducive to the spread of Naxalite ideology. Political changes at the systemic level gave a new voice to groups the Maoists traditionally relied on for support, making the government more responsive to their needs. As a result, land reforms and rural development became a priority at both the state and national levels. While these programs were not always perfectly implemented, poverty rates did decline, and real and perceived inequity were alleviated to some degree. These issues had been drivers of rural unrest in the previous period, and the government’s efforts to address them proved generally successful in keeping the countryside peaceful during these decades. 56 To most observers in 1991, the Naxalist threat appeared to be over. The movement had been wiped out in the state of its birth, sizeable numbers of its former adherents were embracing electoral democracy, and, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Communism was being discredited around the world. In isolated pockets of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, however, the embers of the Maoist revolution continued to smolder. In places the rural reforms had scarcely reached, the People’s War Group, Maoist Communist Center, and Party Unity continued to cling to existence, waiting for the right moment to reignite the fire of Naxalbari. 57 IV. THE RECONSOLIDATION PERIOD (1991-PRESENT) A. INTRODUCTION With an analysis of the first two periods of Naxalite activity complete, this chapter now turns to the most recent iteration of Maoist violence in India. In an examination of the historical evolution of Naxalism, the period from 1991 to the present is certainly the most paradoxical. In the course of little more than 17 years, India has transformed from a large, but isolated and relatively weak state, to one of the central players in the emerging geopolitical order. Its macroeconomic growth is astounding, second only to China in the developing world, and its diplomatic clout on the world stage has increased commensurately. To many outside observers, India looks to be successfully integrating itself into the modern world. And yet, in those same 17 years, an archaic Communist ideology, rejected even in the place of its birth, was also in the ascendancy. Written off by most security analysts in the ashes of the Fragmentary Period from 1972-1991, Naxalism staged a spectacular comeback in the following decades, growing in scope, breadth, and violence. By 2006, its impact was so great that Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was forced to declare, “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problem of Naxalism is the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”183 This is certainly a startling announcement for a nation that suffered through the chaos of Partition, witnessed the violence of a Sikh rebellion in the Punjab, and is still confronted by the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, various insurgencies in the Northeast, fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and continuing Hindu-Muslim communal strife. What explains Naxalism’s phoenix-like rebirth in a period that has witnessed such phenomenal growth and national development? 183 Manmohan Singh, “Prime Minister’s Speech to the 2nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of Chief Ministers on Naxalism,” 13 April 2006, Government of India Press Information Bureau, http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=17128, (accessed August 10, 2007). 58 B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments Since 1991, the most striking development in Indian politics has been the emergence of a truly multi-polar power structure. The declining hegemony of the INC (discussed in the previous chapter) dramatically accelerated during the 1990s, fuelled by the emergence of the “Three M’s” on the political scene: Mandir, Mandal, and Market Reforms.184 In 1998, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition unseated the previous INC administration and inaugurated the longest period of uninterrupted rule by a non\u0002Congress party since independence. Though the INC returned to power in 2004, the BJP’s ascendancy in the 1990s definitively marked the end of one-party dominance in India, resulting in a more complex and contentious political setting than at any other time in the nation’s history. Minority governments and coalition politics are now the order of the day, severely restricting New Delhi’s freedom of action in addressing many pressing issues. In many ways, this increasing gridlock at the national level is reflected in interactions between the central government and those of the states. India’s political structure is distinctly federal, with the 28 state and 7 union territory governments retaining high levels of autonomy from New Delhi, barring the infrequent imposition of ‘President’s Rule’ from the center. This is particularly true with respect to internal security, an area in which the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India grants the individual states great authority and latitude.185 Such a division of powers presents obvious problems for policy coordination, especially when different parties control the various levels of government. This situation was not much of an issue in earlier decades, 184 ‘Mandir’ refers to Hindu Nationalism, ‘Mandal’ to the recommendations of the Mandal Commission report on the status of backward castes, and ‘Market Reforms’ to the economic reforms inaugurated in 1991. For an excellent exposition of these phenomena and their impact on Indian politics, see: Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952- 2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed.

Previously, operations in remote and interior areas used to be paused during the rains, inadvertently giving space to Maoists to carry out recruitment drives or hold meetings with villagers. For the past three-four years, however, specially trained units of state and central security forces have pressed on with operations in forests in monsoon, resulting in the killing of 29 Maoists in encounters since 2020. The past years’ operations have been an example against the perceived notion that security forces wouldn’t be able to carry out operations due to overflowing nullahs, canals and slippery terrain in the forests of Bastar, a Police officer said. Bastar range Inspector general of Police (IGP) Sundarraj P told that security camps established in more than 60 spots in the remote areas have “choked the Maoists” and become “bottleneck points” for movement of the insurgents, while giving forces access to the forests. “Earlier, operations would be stalled but for the past 3-4 years, our ops continue during the (rainy) season, bringing results. CRPF \\[Central Reserve Police Force\\], CoBRA \\[Commando Battalion for resolute Action\\] and Special Task Force \\[STF\\] will be carrying out operations as they are well trained in jungle warfare. An action plan is in place to deal with the challenges of monsoon in the forest and conduct searches,” Sundarraj said. The inter-state operations on bordering areas like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra will also be intensified in the coming weeks and the jawans were well equipped for it. The morale of SFs is high despite casualties, the senior Police officer said. “We have recorded significant positive operational outcomes during this monsoon, since we have made decisive inroads into the erstwhile Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] strongholds by opening strategic operational base camps,” said Sundarraj. **Read less...** | | July - 12 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kot **Read more...** The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kothagudem of Telangana on July 12, reports Telangana Today. Jagan called upon the public to revolt against the ‘fascist Brahmanical Hindutva agenda of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of the UCC. As the people’s opposition towards the BJP’s nine-year rule was on the rise, the BJP was planning to execute its divisive and communal agenda. Through the UCC, Hindutva forces want to create a nefarious divisive line based on religion prior to the five state elections and the general election in 2024. In the last nine years of Narendra Modi's rule, the Indian economy has witnessed prolonged stagnation and decline, he said. Poverty, diseases, the gap between the rich and the poor, and attacks on minorities, dalits, and adivasis have reached levels never seen before. More than 800 million people have been pushed below the poverty line. Jagan noted that the BJP was trying to divert all these from the public’s mind. There would be a threat to the religious rights of minorities, tribals, and even Hindus because of the UCC. The BJP was also dehumanising the Muslim community and wrongly projecting them. There was a need to build a mass movement against the UCC, Jagan added. **Read less...** | | July - 13 | The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. The Maoist leaders for whom wanted notices were issued are Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, and Venkata Ravi Chaitanya alias Aruna. In its statement, the NIA said Aruna and Gajarla Ravi are the key executors of the Maoist strategies in Andhra Pradesh. The NIA informed us further that Aruna led the Maoist group that killed the former MLAs. The double murder took place while Kidari Sarveshwara Rao and Siveri Soma were visiting an interior village in the Araku assembly constituency of Andhra Pradesh. NIA re-registered the case on December 6, 2018 and took up the investigation. In June 2021, the NIA filed a supplementary chargesheet in the case against a woman area committee member of the Maoist group. The NIA said the woman Maoist leader, whom they identified as Kalavathi alias Bhavani, was instrumental in providing logistical support to the team that carried out the killing. **Read less...** | | July - 14 | Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Time **Read more...** Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Times of India on July 15. Maharashtra forces, which have already alerted the Central Government about the Maoists trying to bounce back in Chhattisgarh, have put their security and intelligence units on high alert on the stretch between Kanker-Narayanpur and Bijapur national park. A senior official from the security and intelligence wings said around 1,000 cadres have been recruited by the Maoists in Dantewada and Sukma regions. Another 200–250 new cadres were recruited by the Maoists in South Bastar. \"Earlier, there were barely 50–100 cadres in south Bastar and 200–400 in Dantewada and Sukma, which now have swelled to a substantial number after fresh recruitment,\" said the official. He said the concern was that Maoists would regroup and try to bounce back to their former strength in Chhattisgarh, which would not augur well for Gadchiroli and Gondia across the border in Maharashtra. Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) Sandip Patil, also the chief of the Anti-Naxal Operations (ANO) for Maharashtra, said the central government has been briefed about the developments in Chhattisgarh, which may now affect Maharashtra too, but did not divulge further details. \"Maharashtra forces are ready with strategies to counter any fresh threats,\" he said. It’s been learned that the Maoists are planning major attacks on Police posts that the Governments of different states are opening in their strongholds in central India. The Maoists’ ‘technical and research’ wing is said to be developing Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED) to blow them up near Police posts after mounting them on tractors or four-wheelers used in the rural areas. The Maoists are also developing drones to carry and drop up to five kilograms of explosives on Police Stations. In the latest issue of their mouthpiece, the Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] claim to have well responded to the aerial attacks and surveillance in Chhattisgarh with their counter strategy. **Read less...** | | July - 15 | To choke the flow of funds to Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists (LWEs)\\] in the state, the Bihar Police has intensified its crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts, reports Deccan Herald on July 16.

The anti-Naxal crackdown by the Special Task Force (STF) along with other Security Forces (SFs) has dried up the weapons pipeline, leading to the number of armed extremists dropping drastically in the state, said a senior Police officer. \"Now the Bihar Police, in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and other concerned wings of the government, have intensified their crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui districts in the state\", Sushil Mansingh Khopde, Additional Director General (ADG-operations), STF, said. The ADG said despite law enforcement agencies destroying hundreds of acres of poppy plants each year, inputs suggest that clandestine opium poppy cultivation is present in certain pockets in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts. \"Inputs also suggest that Maoists \\[Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist)\\] have been using opium cultivation as a source of revenue in these areas. They levy a 'tax' on poppy cultivators and small enterprises. Law enforcement agencies destroyed around 600 acres of poppy plantation in these areas in 2021, and in 2022, around 1200 acres were destroyed\", the ADG said, adding, \"The concerned district police and other agencies have been instructed to keep a vigil on clandestine opium poppy cultivation in specific areas in the district.\" Further, ADG Khopde said, \"The number of Maoist-affected districts will further reduce in the coming months. No major Maoist incidents have been reported till June this year. Some armed cadres are only concentrated on the hills of Chakarbandha on the Gaya-Aurangabad border near Jharkhand and in the hilly areas of Jamui and Lakhisarai-Munger.

In a press note issued on November 23, the OSD reminded people that Maoists had issued a statement urging the people to boycott the impending Assembly elections slated for November 30. He, however, reassured the public of the foolproof security arrangements in place to ensure the smooth conduct of the elections. The Maoist action team, reportedly comprising members such as Kunjam Idumal alias Mahender, Kovvasi Ganga alias Mahesh, and others, has reportedly crossed into the Mulugu area with intentions to disrupt the elections. Their strategies allegedly involve targeting security personnel, people’s representatives, political leaders, and officials involved in election duties, instigating fear and chaos among the public. “To combat this threat, Mulugu police have initiated stringent measures, including drone surveillance, cordon search operations, tactical vehicle checks, and area dominance,” the OSD said, emphasizing the grave risk posed by the Maoists to politicians and others, urging the people to remain vigilant and cautious. **Read less...** | | November - 23 | Jharkhand Chief Minister (CM) Hemant Soren, on November 23, declared that the state Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) are in the concluding stages of eliminating Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] menace in the state, reports The Telegraph.

He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&nbsp;_ _In this Q&A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world._ ## **The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it?** The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed.[1](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote1) So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( _see graph below_). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.[2](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote2) Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts.[3](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote3) Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. Close footnote ## How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also [targeted locals](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/) whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes.[4](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote4) Close footnote ## What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk.[5](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote5) And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so.

SFs recovered one AK47 rifle, one Light Machine Gun (LMG) and explosives from the encounter spot. The identities of the slain Maoists are yet to be ascertained. On April 5, 2024, one CPI-Maoist cadre was gunned down by SFs in the forest area near Kirandul in the Dantewada District of Chhattisgarh. During the search, SFs recovered the dead body of the Maoist, his weapon and explosives from the encounter site. On April 2, 2024, 13 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in a forest near Lendra village under the Gangaloor Police Station limits of the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh. The identity of the dead Maoists was yet to be ascertained, but _prima facie_, it appeared that they belonged to the Maoist’s PLGA (People's Liberation Guerrilla Army) Company No. 2, a senior Police official disclosed. Police recovered weapons, including a Light Machine Gun (LMG), a .303 rifle, and a 12-bore gun, along with a substantial quantity of barrel grenade launchers, shells, and other arms and ammunition, from the site. On April 1, 2024, two CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in the Kerajhari Forest of the Balaghat District in Madhya Pradesh. The Police recovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist ‘divisional committee member (DCM)’ Sajanti _aka_ Kranti and ‘area committee member (ACM)’ Raghu _aka_ Sher Singh (54), both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounty announcements by the Police in three states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Elsewhere on the same day, one CPI-Maoist cadre was killed in an encounter with SFs in the forest area near Tetemadgu village under Kistaram Police Station limits in the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh. The dead body of the Maoist and his weapons were recovered from the encounter site. The identity of the slain Maoist is yet to be ascertained. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), at least 58 _Naxalites_ \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] have been killed by the SFs during the current year, 2024 (data till April 7). During the corresponding period of 2023, SFs had eliminated nine _Naxalites_. Through 2023, SFs killed 58 _Naxalites_, in addition to 67 killed in 2022. According to the SATP database, SFs arrested 401 _Naxalites_ in 2023 as against 395 arrests in 2022. In 2024, as on April 7, the number of arrests stood at 92. Since March 6, 2000, according to SATP data, 16,364 _Naxalites_ have been arrested (data till April 7, 2024). Through 2023, SFs recovered weapons and ammunition from the Maoists in 223 incidents, in addition to 193 such incidents of recovery in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the number of such incidents was 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,917 incidents of arms recovery are on record. Mounting pressure on the _Naxalites_ has resulted in a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP data, at least 254 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2023, in addition to 2,855 surrenders in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, 42 surrenders have been recorded. Since March 6, 2000, 16,780 _Naxalites_ have surrendered (data till April 7, 2024). Continuing SF successes on the ground further improved the overall security situation through 2023. The trend of declining overall fatalities, on year-on-year basis, in Left Wing Extremism-related violence, has been established since 2018, though a marginal reversal occurred in 2023 at around 11.11 per cent (from 135 in 2022 to 150 in 2023). According to SATP data, a total of 150 people (61 civilians, 31 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_) were killed in such violence through 2023, as against 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) recorded in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the total number of such fatalities stood at 93 (22 civilians, 13 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_), as against 37 such fatalities (19 civilians, nine SF personnel and nine _Naxalites_) reported during the corresponding period of 2023. According to SATP data, the number of civilian fatalities (61) recorded through 2023 was the third lowest in this category since 2000. Two other previous lows were recorded at 53 in 2022 and 58 in 2021. A third low of 61 was also recorded in 2020. The maximum number of civilians killed in such violence, 630, was in 2010. Though the number of fatalities among SFs increased from 15 in 2022 to 31 in 2023, according to SATP data, the number of fatalities in 2023 was the second lowest in this category since 2000. A previous low of 15 was recorded in 2022. The maximum number of SFs killed in such violence, 319, was in 2009. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2023, at 1:1.87, improving the ratio in favour of the SFs in 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2022, the ratio was at 1:4.46, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Also, in 2009 the ratio was at 1.01:1. In 2007, the ratio was at 1.2:1 favouring the Maoists. However, since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.63). In the current year, the kill ratio remains in favour of the SFs at 1:4.46, so far (data till April 7, 2024). Other parameters of violence indicate that, despite sustained SF pressure, the Maoists but retain significant operational capabilities across the country. At least eight major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) were recorded in 2023, compared to seven such incidents in 2022. There were 89 incidents of exchange of fire between SFs and Maoist in 2023, compared to 86 such incidents in 2022. Further, the Maoists orchestrated at least 62 incidents of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in 2023, compared to 32 such incidents in 2022. Moreover, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents of violence increased marginally from 602 in 2022 to 603 in 2023. In particular, incidents in which the Maoists killed civilians and SFs increased from 63 in 2022 to 77 in 2023. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from 12 States in 2023, in comparison to 10 States in 2022. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 12 affected States have a total of 83 Districts which recorded a Maoist presence. Of these, seven districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 20 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 56 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2022, of 57 affected districts from 10 states, two districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 27 were ‘marginally affected’. However, in a written reply to a question in the _Rajya Sabha_ (Upper House of the Indian Parliament) on February 7, 2024, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai claimed that the resolute implementation of the “National Policy and Action Plan (NPAP) to address LWE” approved in 2015, resulted in a consistent decline in violence and constriction of the geographical spread of LWE influence. LWE-related violence and resultant deaths (Civilians + Security Forces) declined by 73 per cent from a high in 2010, by 90 per cent in 2022, and by 86 per cent in 2023. Further, Rai stated that the number of Police Stations reporting LWE-related violence had reduced significantly, from 465 Police Stations across 96 districts in 2010 to 176 Police Stations across 45 districts in 2022 and 171 Police Stations across 42 districts in 2023. Clearly, all major LWE-affected states across the country – see Andhra Pradesh’s **[Residual Vexations](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-29#assessment2)**, Bihar’s **[Halted Menace](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-35#assessment2)**, Chhattisgarh’s **[Persisting Disruptions](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-33#assessment2)**, Jharkhand’s **[Risks amidst decline](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-31#assessment2)**, Madhya Pradesh’s **[Enduring Risks](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-41#assessment2)**, Maharashtra’s **[Ineffective ‘Revival’](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-36#assessment2)**, Odisha’s **[Enduring challenges](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-34#assessment2)**, and Telangana’s **[Sustained Dominance](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-37#assessment2)** have recorded substantial improvement in the security situation in the regions affected by LWE activity. Earlier, on January 21, 2024, the union home minister (UHM) Amit Shah, had asserted that the country would be free from the menace of _Naxalism_ in the next three years, and directed states to expedite development activities in remote areas affected by the ultras. UHM Shah also directed the Security Forces (SFs) to financially choke the ultras and instructed officials to prepare a blueprint to end _Naxalism_. He also stressed the need for expediting development in _Naxalite_-affected areas, asserting that all welfare schemes of the central and state governments would have to be implemented in these areas with renewed vigour. Meanwhile, on January 11, 2024, the Chhattisgarh government invited Maoists to hold unconditional talks, suggesting \"video calls if they are reluctant to come for physical meetings\". Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma, who holds the state's Home portfolio, stating that this would be a step towards restoring peace and stability in the Bastar region, thus observed, | | | --- | | We are prepared to provide Naxalites an online platform to express their grievances, ideas and desires. I am open to discussions with the young cadres any time, 24x7, without any conditions. I am available for any topic the Naxalites wish to discuss, but they must be willing to engage. If they regret their decision to join the outfit or wish to reintegrate with mainstream society, I extend my hand to them and urge them to lead a peaceful life and serve the country. | While holding out an olive branch, the Government made it clear that there would be no softening of stance. The Deputy Chief Minister thus warned, | | | --- | | If they fail to grasp the importance of dialogue, they will have to pay for the pain they have inflicted on our people ('dard ka hisaab hoga'). They must understand that peace talks cannot occur with guns and bullets. A well-ordered society is not governed by firearms. We want to discuss what they desire, why they carry weapons, why they mislead and trouble people, why they oppose progress in villages, and why they do not support the establishment of hospitals, schools, water facilities, and _anganwadis_. | Meanwhile, according to a March 21, 2024, media report, Chhattisgarh's Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma's call for unconditional dialogue with Maoists prompted a response from the CPI-Maoist, with the rebels presenting certain preconditions and emphasizing the necessity of a conducive environment for talks to ensure the welfare and lasting peace of oppressed and exploited segments of society. In a letter, CPI-Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) 'spokesman' Vikalp outlined several conditions before any agreement could be reached to engage in dialogue. These conditions included the cessation of atrocities and false encounters on tribals, halting militarization in tribal regions, withdrawing security forces, and annulling agreements with corporate entities. In a two-page letter dated March 15, 2024, Maoist spokesperson Vikalp declared that, if their demands were met, they would be ready to engage in dialogue via mobile phone calls. He noted, further, | | | --- | | We had previously responded to the invitation for talks, stating that our central agenda is none other than the overall development of the oppressed and harassed sections of society, including tribal, Dalit, Muslim, and minority communities, as well as farmers, women, and the middle class. Additionally, we advocate for equal pay for equal work based on gender equality and an end to state violence against women. | Vikalp also insisted on providing loan waivers for farmers, increasing agricultural subsidies, providing free irrigation and electricity, cancelling agreements with international companies, and implementing welfare schemes such as free education, housing, healthcare, and employment. The Maoists thus gave _bandh_ (general shut down strike) calls on their whims. In their latest call on March 30, 2024, the Maoists called for a _bandh_ in Bijapur and Sukma on April 3, 2024, to protest the killing of six Maoists in an encounter in the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh on March 27, 2024, which the rebels claimed was a \"fake encounter\". However, the _bandh_ calls were peaceful. Rejecting the allegations of fake encounters as \"old tactics\" of the Maoists, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar range, Sundarraj P., asserted, | | | --- | | It is the typical _modus operandi_ of Maoists to level allegations against the security forces to puncture the credibility of security forces. Maoists conveniently forget that they are responsible for brutal killings of hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians. Just to distract the attention from their inhumane behaviour, they issue these kinds of statements. All concerned understand the reality that the Maoists are facing their extinction. | Earlier, on March 26, 2024, Mohan, the ‘secretary’ of the CPI-Maoist West Bastar Division Committee, had issued a press note which announced that Bijapur would remain closed on March 30. In the note the Maoist leader accused the Police of killing 15 tribals since January. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government in Chhattisgarh has been accused of fake encounters, atrocities, and the eviction of tribals from forests and land, and denial of access to water resources. The Maoists warned transporters and businessmen that they would be responsible if they operated on March 30. However, the _bandh_ passed without any disruptive activities. The Maoists issued nine _Bandh_ calls in 2023 across the country, as against eight such calls in 2022. The Maoist movement has weakened, as the SFs now increasingly dominate areas long under LWE sway. Nevertheless, the capacities to sustain dominance remain limited. According to _Bureau of Police Research and Development_ (BPR&D) data, the all-India Police-population ratio was 152.80 (as on January 1, 2022), in comparison to 152.51 per 100,000 on January 1, 2021. Some of the Maoists’ affected States have much worse police-population ratios: Bihar, at 75.16; Odisha at 122.59; and Maharashtra at 136.45. Even in States like Jharkhand, where the police-population ratio, at 162.73, exceeds the national average, it remains much lower than the 220/100,000 ratio regarded as desirable for 'peacetime policing'. Moreover, there were 504 (17.59 per cent) vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) in the 12 affected States, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. Further, huge vacancies persist in the total strength of the State Police forces, which have been increasingly used in the fight against the _Naxalites_: there were 417,784 vacant posts in the 12 affected States, as on January 1, 2022, against a sanctioned strength of 1,642,759 (actual strength: 1,224,965). Significantly, these constituted 72.3 per cent of the 595,105 vacant posts across India, as on January 1, 2022. Moreover, against a sanctioned strength of 324,654 in the CRPF, the lead counter-insurgency Force in the country, the actual strength stood at 309,544, a vacancy of 15,110 personnel. Stark deficits are visible in some of the worst afflicted States. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2022, there were at least 22 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst _Naxalism_-affected State, which did not have a telephone. Similarly, the second worst affected State, Jharkhand, had 211 such Police Stations without telephone connections. The number of Police Stations without a vehicle in Jharkhand was 47, while 31 Police stations in the state hand no wireless/mobile phone. The Maoists are certainly losing their impact across the country; however, the danger of resurgence remains alive. There is urgent need to build the necessary capacities to sustain, indeed, heighten pressure at this stage, in order to consolidate the gains of recent years. | [Assessments Year

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with “unspecified casualties” on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi’s China and Modi’s India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China’s ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China’s abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India’s protest in denying Beijing’s claims as “exaggerated and untenable” is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi’s “clarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat”_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India’s active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China’s nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India’s nuclear strike range_** **_(right) – estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India’s national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China’s “containment of India,” the modernization of the PLA and its “growing assertiveness on the border”, and recommended a shift of India’s national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China’s unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or “string of pearls” that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India’s security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India’s peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China’s energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China’s power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China’s “Malacca dilemma,” by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing’s interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of “the quad”, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing’s ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India’s nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India’s boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India’s dismay. When BRI’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India’s doctrine of “strategic autonomy”. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek “equivalence” with the great powers — China, Russia, US — in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi’s party and support the base’s nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem “techno-nationalism”.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India’s dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India’s military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China’s relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. Commensurate to China’s 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a “peaceful rise” of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world’s longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India’s options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India’s strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India’s preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India’s “Neighborhood First” policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi’s ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal’s stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the “Asian Century” may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India’s geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide “chicken’s neck” connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China’s favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi’s strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India’s advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ”partners” with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh’s deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China’s border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its “like-minded partners” in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India’s diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war – for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India’s irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China’s assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-à-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, “wolf-warrior diplomacy”, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India – the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its “NORMS — New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System” approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India’s quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact – an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China – to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia – India’s soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter’s unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese “iron brother”, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China’s increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India’s disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled.

Over 50,000 clips were stolen and sold online, affecting 80 systems nationwide. This highlights critical cybersecurity lapses, with investigations ongoing despite arrests. RAJKOT: A shocking cybercrime has rocked India’s digital security landscape, with hackers stealing at least 50,000 CCTV clips over nine months from facilities across the country and selling them online for anything between Rs 700 and Rs 4,000 per clip, feeding them into an international porn fetish network for profit.Investigators revealed that 80 CCTV dashboards were compromised, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate offices, factories, cinema halls, and even private residences across cities including Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Surat, Ahmedabad, Delhi, and more. Horror In Coimbatore: Student Gang Raped After Abduction, Three Accused Shot And Arrested By Police The scam came to light when teaser clips from Payal Maternity Hospital in Rajkot appeared on YouTube channels like “Megha Mbbs” and “cp monda”, leading customers to Telegram groups where the stolen footage was sold. Officials said the breaches were made possible by default passwords such as “admin123”, enabling hackers to launch automated attacks and collect massive amounts of sensitive footage.Despite the primary arrests being made earlier in 2025, investigators found that these illegally obtained clips were still available on Telegram groups until at least June.Investigators found that many of these CCTV systems still used factory-set passwords like ‘admin123’, which had not been changed during setup. This enabled the hackers to initiate an aggressive and automated assault.An officer from the cybercrime branch in Ahmedabad told TOI: “The primary method used was a ‘brute force attack’ (hackers using a program or bot to try every possible combination of letters and numbers for a lock).” Parit Dhameliya, the lead hacker in the operation, a BCom graduate, employed three different software programs to achieve this.“First, Dhameliya used a website called suIP.biz to obtain the IP addresses (the unique online location) of cameras in Gujarat. These IPs were then fed into a software called ‘Masscan’ which quickly scanned for open ports (the specific digital doorways that allow remote communication).”Next, the attackers used a specialized hacking tool called ‘SWC software’, which can reveal a camera’s ID, password, and IP address once the system is compromised. Using these stolen credentials, another accused, Rohit Sisodiya — later arrested in Delhi and who had posed as a medical laboratory technology diploma holder — accessed the hospital’s cameras through the DMSS application, a tool normally used for legitimate remote viewing.The officer added, “To access this sensitive footage cost around Rs 700 per person, though the highest-demand voyeuristic clips sold for up to Rs. 4,000. Praj Patil, also a NEET aspirant, acted as the financial facilitator, providing his mobile number and bank account to collect subscription payments.” To conceal their location, the attackers relied heavily on international infrastructure, routing their activities through virtual private networks (VPNs) that made their origins appear to be in cities like Bucharest in Romania, and New York in the US.The massive scale of unauthorized access — exceeding 11,000 successful external sessions in total — was meticulously tracked through log files spanning from Jan 2024 through early Dec 2024. The core members, including Prajwal Teli, Praj Patil, and Chandraprakash Phoolchand, were arrested within 39 hours of the FIR being registered. The threat actors were charged under several sections of the BNS Act and IT Act, including cyber terrorism. _[Get an chance to win ₹5000 Amazon Voucher by taking part in India's Biggest Habit Index!

The two main actors that constitute the best hope for global growth are obviously India and China. Of the two, India is in many ways the better bet. The country’s ‘bottom-up’ economic model (enabling it to better withstand systemic shocks), its demographic composition and its democratic system provide it with a future outlook that is brighter than China’s. Also, it is impressive that, despite endemic corruption, poor infrastructure, and a currently weak and directionless Congress Party-dominated government, India’s economy maintains a growth rate of 6%. Moving into an era of multipolarity, the importance of enhancing ties with a rising power like India is of great strategic importance for the West. At the same time, though, India is facing internal security pressures, albeit largely unknown to many investors and policy makers. Large swaths of Indian territory are plagued by conflict between the state and the long-running Maoist insurgency group known as the Naxalites. If not dealt with effectively, the Naxalites might prove to be too much for New Delhi and turn out to be India’s Achilles heel imperiling its phenomenal global rise. The current manifestation of Maoist-inspired violence in India can be traced back to the period immediately following the country’s independence in 1948. The term Naxal or Naxalite is derived from the Indian village of Naxalbari (West Bengal) where the movement has its roots. The stated goal of the Naxalites was, and remains to this day, to free the poor from the clutches of the landlords, to implement land reforms and destroy the oppressive feudal order in India. A central part their strategy to achieve this goal has been a guerrilla war against government forces in the underdeveloped rural and tribal regions of India. Although the nature of the movement makes it difficult to estimate the group’s size, recent estimates by The Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence service, have placed the numerical strength of the Naxalites at some 20,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. These numbers would suggest that the Naxalites are almost twice as big as the FARC movement in Columbia, which numbered around 11,000 operatives in 2009. The Naxalites’ organizational structure includes an elaborate hierarchy with a Central Committee at the top, followed by Regional Bureaus, Zonal or State Committees, and District or Division Committees. Following a period of internal strife and fractional splits, in 2004 the a merger occurred to create an umbrella organizational structure for the Naxalite insurgency. This reunification was followed by an upswing in the level of violence. Like all successful or enduring insurgent groups, the Naxalites follow a two-tiered strategy, using violence against their opponents as well as engaging in socio-economic initiatives to win the support of the population. With regard to the latter, it is important to note that the Naxalite insurgency puts much effort into addressing the grievances of the marginalised poor, who are disappointed in – or even hostile towards – the Indian government. For instance, Naxalite fighters have campaigned for women’s rights, have tried to improve the housing situation of those in need, have organised railway strikes, and have run irrigation projects to help farmers increase their harvests. The violent actions that make up the other second pillar of he Naxalite strategy are mostly aimed against the police, Indian government officials and transnational corporations. These attacks are intended to shield the population from capitalist influence. The Naxalites are quite successful in this regard, as the group has managed to take control of certain regions, especially in the Red Corridor, where state power has been eroded or has collapsed altogether. Several factors account for the Naxalites’ ability to pull off tours de force of this kind. First, the manpower that the Indian insurgents brings to bear, gives them the organisational clout needed to wage a large-scale campaign. Second, although the Naxalites are geographically dispersed and not centrally led, the group shows a remarkable commitment to the overall strategy. Although the group’s operatives occasionally lash out at the local population, Naxalite actions generally fit the ambition to create Naxalite-controlled areas to encircle the cities and eventually take over the country. The third explanation of the insurgency’s sustainability is the fact that many Naxalite operatives are active in their native areas. From this, they derive knowledge of the terrain, crucial in irregular warfare, as well as familiarity with the local population and its plight, which makes it unlikely that they will be perceived as interlopers. Another factor that makes it unlikely that the Naxalite insurgency will soon be a thing of the past is the inadequacy of the Indian government’s response. While it is clear that discrimination and poverty of the rural population provide the Naxalites with a support base and a pool of potential recruits, the government’s measures to alleviate the living conditions of the rural poor are generally half-hearted and poorly implemented. Rather, the government tries to quell the insurgency by taking a hard approach with a central role for law enforcement agencies. Thus far however, this hard line has not yielded the desired results. The number of police forces deployed against the Naxalites was recently increased to 76,000, but the insurgency is still alive and kicking. And even regardless of the effectiveness of the government line, it remains to be seen whether it is sustainable. India is one of the most underpoliced countries in the world, and there is little chance that the government will deploy the army, reluctant as it is to start a long and messy campaign and to take forces away from Jammu and Kashmir. It appears that the Naxalites are here to stay. All too often, analyses of India are based on the assumption that its rise is inevitable and effortless. For a long time, the western view was that the rest of the world held little allure to the west, but now, the received wisdom on India at business and international relations conferences is an overcompensation of earlier neglect and underestimation. This overly sunny view is as misguided as the prior arrogance. What is needed is a sober analysis of India’s economy and internal security situation. The goal of this article has certainly not been to denigrate the future potential of India or to engage in fear mongering. Rather, we have tried to draw attention to an important actor on the Indian scene that until now has received only minimal international attention. Adding this dimension to current thinking about India will allow investors and policy makers to make informed decisions on when, how and where to invest their money in India. If India is serious about defeating the Naxalites, they will need to deal with the root causes of the group’s appeal in the Red Corridor, which will require addressing poverty, corruption and tribal inclusion issues. Only by doing so can India retain the domestic stability that is a prerequisite for its continued phenomenal rise. ### About The Author ## Article Discussion: ![Small Wars Journal by Arizona State University](https://smallwarsjournal.com/wp-content/themes/swj/images/logo_icon.svg) ### Become a Member To Engage!

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively. This is despite widespread condemnation from independent human rights bodies and refrains from the judiciary.[28](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Karan Thapar, ‘UN Special Rapporteurs Condemn Home Demolitions in India, See Collective Punishment of Muslims,’ The Wire, 18 June 2022](https://thewire.in/rights/un-special-rapporteurs-condemn-home-demolitions-in-india-see-collective-punishment-of-muslims); [Outlook, ‘Supreme Court Grills UP Government On “Bulldozer Action” In House Demolitions,’ 27 July 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/supreme-court-grills-up-government-on-bulldozer-action-in-house-demolitions-news-306157); [Anwesha Mitra, ‘“Ethnic cleansing” by state?

Ashley, ‘How the Spectre of Hindutva Captured Politics in Kerala,’ The Wire, 30 October 2020](https://thewire.in/politics/kerala-elections-hindutva-muslims) The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

The recent floods across parts of India are the consequence of a wide range of factors, including excessive untimely and prolonged rainfall that occurred, coastal storm surge, water main breaks, dam failures, and more. Flooding results in instant devastation. Floods have the potential to cause significant business disruptions, food shortages, and product shortages. Companies in India have begun acknowledging such natural catastrophic risks to their business; however, concrete efforts are still nascent. Initiatives tend to focus on driving stewardship rather than addressing material risks to operations and value chains. Moreover, very few companies are quantifying their current and future climate risks in financial terms. Floods have caused the most devastation of any of these disasters, notably hitting the states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. According to reports, the floods have significantly damaged the area and resulted in an estimated economic loss of between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 crore. The severe damage caused by these floods and previous incidents like the 'Biparjoy' cyclone has raised serious concerns. It emphasises how India is vulnerable to several natural hazards due to its geographic and geographic location. These figures highlight how important catastrophe preparedness is for companies doing business in India. As the country experiences a high frequency of natural disasters, it becomes crucial for businesses to proactively address potential risks and adopt resilient strategies to protect their operations and assets. The effects of natural catastrophes on business operations can be reduced by putting into place comprehensive disaster management plans that include risk assessments, emergency response procedures, and continuity measures. Companies should consider conducting comprehensive risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities and develop contingency plans specific to their locations and industry sectors. This will enable them to better understand the potential risks they face and formulate tailored strategies for disaster preparedness and response. With the increasing frequency and severity of floods in our region, it is essential to prioritise disaster recovery planning to protect the business establishment. Floods can have a devastating impact on businesses, causing damage to infrastructure, disrupting operations, and leading to financial losses. By taking proactive measures, we can mitigate risks and enhance resilience. Here is a checklist that outlines some key considerations for businesses: 01. **Risk assessment**: Determines the frequency and severity of natural, man-made and political perils that can affect the organisation and its facilities. By identifying and quantifying these exposures, controls can be implemented to mitigate them as well as provide a cost/ benefit analysis to justify investment in these controls. 02. **Insurance coverage**: Review your insurance policies, particularly your property and business interruption coverage, to ensure they include adequate protection against flood-related damages. Engage with your insurance provider to understand the extent of coverage and any additional options available for flood insurance. 03. **Emergency response plan**: Develop a comprehensive emergency response plan specific to flooding scenarios. Clearly outline roles and responsibilities for your staff during a flood event, establish evacuation procedures, and designate assembly points or safe areas. Regularly review and update this plan as necessary. 04. **Data backup and recovery**: Implement a robust data backup and recovery system to protect your business's critical information. Store backups offsite or in the cloud to ensure accessibility even if your primary systems are compromised during a flood. Test the restoration process periodically to verify its effectiveness. 05. **Physical protection measures**: Take physical measures to safeguard your establishment from flood damage. This may include installing flood barriers or shields, sealing openings vulnerable to water ingress, elevating electrical systems and valuable equipment, and relocating critical utilities to higher levels. 06. **Communication and notification**: Establish reliable communication channels to quickly disseminate information to employees, customers, and suppliers during a flood event. Develop a communication plan that includes alternative means of contact if traditional channels are disrupted. Keep stakeholders informed about any changes in operations or disruptions to services. 07. **Inventory and asset protection**: Regularly maintain an updated inventory of your business assets, including equipment, stock, and supplies. Implement measures to protect inventory from flood damage, such as elevating storage or using waterproof containers. Develop a plan for relocating inventory in case of an impending flood. 08. **Business continuity plan**: Create a business continuity plan that outlines steps to resume operations after a flood. This includes identifying alternative locations or temporary workspaces, establishing communication channels with key stakeholders, and prioritising critical activities to minimise downtime. 09. **Employee safety and support**: Prioritise the safety and wellbeing of employees. Educate them about flood risks and safety protocols, provide training on evacuation procedures, and ensure access to necessary resources, such as emergency supplies and medical assistance. Offer support and resources for employees affected by floods, demonstrating your commitment to their welfare. 10. **Coordination with external agencies**: Coordinate response, continuity and restoration activities with local, regional and national authorities, and with compliance to statutes and regulations. Share best practices, and collectively address challenges. By implementing measures from the checklist, businesses can significantly reduce the impact of natural catastrophic (NatCat) perils and expedite the recovery process. Adaptation and preparedness are key to maintaining continuity, safeguarding assets, and protecting your employees and customers. ### We can help WTW’s Strategic Risk Consulting experts can help mitigate clients total cost of risk (TCOR).

When was NDMA constituted?](https://www.vajiramandravi.com/www.vajiramandravi.com#q2-when-was-ndma-constituted) ## **What’s in today’s article?** - Background - Key Events in 2023 - India’s Unique Vulnerabilities - Earthquake Risks - Challenges in Resilience and Insurance - Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach - Conclusion ## **Background** - India has witnessed a sharp rise in economic losses due to natural catastrophes, reflecting both the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and the country’s vulnerabilities. - In 2023, natural disasters caused an estimated **$12 billion** in economic losses, significantly exceeding the annual average of **$8 billion** over the past decade, according to a report by global insurance giant **Swiss Re**. ## **Key Events in 2023** - **Floods in Northern India and Sikkim (July 2023):** - **Affected Areas:** Himachal Pradesh, including Shimla, and Delhi. - **Impact:** Caused extensive damage due to heavy rains between **July 10-15**, disrupting daily life and infrastructure. - **Tropical Cyclone Biparjoy (June 2023):** - **Landfall:** Category 3 cyclone struck Kutch, Gujarat, impacting Maharashtra and Rajasthan as well. - **Damage:** Shut down major ports like Kandla and Mundra, causing extensive damage due to strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. - **Tropical Cyclone Michaung (December 2023):** - **Landfall:** Hit Chennai, Tamil Nadu. - **Impact:** Brought extreme rainfall, resulting in significant economic losses and urban disruption. ## **India’s Unique Vulnerabilities** - **Monsoon-Driven Floods:** - **Contribution to Losses:** Over the past two decades, floods have accounted for an average of **63%** of annual economic losses. - **Monsoon Influence:** India’s geography and climate expose it to heavy rainfall during: - **Summer Monsoon (June-September):** Causes severe flooding, as seen in Kerala (2018) and Uttarakhand (2013). - **Northeast Monsoon (October-December):** Responsible for floods like Chennai (2015). - **Economic and Industrial Exposure:** - States like **Gujarat**, **Maharashtra**, and **Tamil Nadu** are highly industrialized, contributing **36.8%** of India’s total industrial output. These states also face heightened risks: - **Gujarat:** Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. - **Maharashtra:** Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. - **Tamil Nadu:** Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. ## **Earthquake Risks** - Urban centres like **Delhi** and **Ahmedabad** face significant earthquake hazards. - A major earthquake in the **Himalayas** or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** in Gujarat. ## **Challenges in Resilience and Insurance** - Despite the scale of economic losses, **underinsurance** remains a critical issue: - **Protection Gaps:** Over **90%** of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. - **Costliest Flood Events:** - **Mumbai floods (2005):** Losses of **$5.3 billion** (2024 prices) - **Chennai floods (2015):** Losses of **$6.6 billion** (2024 prices) ## **Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach** - Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: - **Hotspot Identification:** - Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. - Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. - **Risk Assessment:** - Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. - Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. - **Reinsurance Solutions:** - Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. - Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. ## **Conclusion** - India’s rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. - The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. - By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. ### **Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods?** Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. ### **Q2. When was NDMA constituted?** In December 2005, the Government of India enacted the Disaster Management Act, which envisaged the creation of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers. **Source :** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-economic-losses-natural-catastrophes-9779008/) ‹› Latest UPSC Exam 2025 Updates Last updated on November, 2025 → Check out the latest [**UPSC Syllabus**](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-syllabus/) 2026 here. → Join Vajiram & Ravi’s [**Interview Guidance Programme**](https://vajiramandravi.com/all-courses/interview-guidance-program/upsc-cse/) for expert help to crack your final UPSC stage. → **[UPSC Mains Result 2025](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/upsc-mains-result/)** is now out. → [**UPSC Notification 2026**](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/upsc-2026/) is scheduled to be released on January 14, 2026. → **[UPSC Calendar 2026](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/upsc-calendar/)** is released on 15th May, 2025. → The **UPSC Vacancy 2025** were released **1129**, out of which **979** were for **UPSC CSE** and remaining **150** are for **UPSC IFoS**. → [**UPSC Prelims 2026**](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/upsc-prelims/) will be conducted on **24th May, 2026**& **UPSC Mains 2026** will be conducted on **21st August 2026.** → The UPSC Selection Process is of 3 stages-Prelims, Mains and Interview. → [**UPSC Result 2024**](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/upsc-result/) is released with latest [**UPSC Marksheet 2024**](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/upsc-marksheet/).

    "full_text": "[0](https://bisi.org.uk/cart) # India’s Climate Crisis [Asia Pacific](https://bisi.org.uk/reports/category/Asia+Pacific)[Environment](https://bisi.org.uk/reports/category/Environment)[Policy](https://bisi.org.uk/reports/category/Policy) 5 May Written By [Analyst](https://bisi.org.uk/reports?author=6634df3035838c6c9ca23281) [Divya Narvekar](https://bisi.org.uk/divya-narvekar) \\| 5 May 2025 **Summary** - India has faced climate and environmental challenges since the 1970s, which are exacerbated by its geographical diversity and high population density, despite accounting for only 7% of global emissions and 17% of the world’s population. - Climate change poses a significant threat to food security, affecting agriculture, fisheries, human health and livestock. Extreme levels of air and water pollution resulted in increased infant mortality rates, reduced life expectancy, and inadequate sanitation conditions. - India is expected to experience more frequent heatwaves, coastal flooding, and water crises in the coming years. The economic toll of climate change on India is substantial. Projections suggest potential GDP losses ranging from 6.4% to over 10% by 2100, with an estimated 50 million people at risk of falling back into poverty due to climate-related challenges. **Heatwaves** In May 2016, an all-time record high temperature of 51°C was recorded in Rajasthan, India. Subsequently, in May 2023, 10 Indian states faced a prolonged heat wave lasting 2–3 weeks. A heatwave is a prolonged period of excessively high temperatures, often accompanied by dry conditions, which can have severe impacts on human health, agriculture, and infrastructure. In India, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) defines a heatwave as: - Plains: When temperatures reach ≥40°C (104°F) or are 4.5–6.4°C above normal. - Coastal & Hilly Areas: When temperatures reach ≥37°C or exceed normal by at least 4.5°C. India has experienced widespread deforestation, mainly driven by agricultural expansion and industrialisation. The loss of forest cover diminishes the natural cooling effect of trees, leading to rising temperatures and intensifying the severity of heatwaves. Heat-related deaths have surged, and energy demands for cooling have skyrocketed. As global temperatures rise, the most vulnerable populations around the world will continue to suffer the most, as climate change threatens livelihoods and displaces communities. To combat heatwaves, India needs better climate adaptation strategies, increased public awareness, and improved urban planning. Strengthening early warning systems, enhancing green cover, and promoting sustainable infrastructure can help reduce the devastating impact of extreme heat. **Sea level rise (SLR)** Sea level rise is one of the most severe consequences of climate change, posing a significant threat to India’s coastal cities, ecosystems, and livelihoods. India has a 7500 km coastline and is home to millions of people, major economic hubs, and crucial infrastructure. As global temperatures rise, melting glaciers and polar ice caps contribute to increasing sea levels, which lead to coastal erosion, flooding, and salinity intrusion into freshwater sources. With India close to the equator, the sub-continent would see much higher SLR, and storm surges would lead to saltwater intrusion in the coastal areas of Kolkata and Mumbai, both densely populated cities, particularly vulnerable to coastal flooding. Rapid construction along coastlines has destroyed natural barriers like mangroves, wetlands, and sand dunes. Some ways to mitigate the [impact](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/climate-change/with-rising-seas-indias-coastlines-confront-the-dual-crises-of-ecological-loss-and-socio-economic-upheaval) of SLR include building sea walls, improving early warning systems and promoting sustainable coastal behaviours. The restoration of natural barriers such as mangroves and wetlands should also be prioritised. **Heavy rains & flooding** India experiences intense rainfall and severe flooding due to monsoon patterns, cyclonic storms, and climate change. India is vulnerable to flood [disasters](https://www.undrr.org/publication/global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-2015), with an average annual loss from floods estimated to be approximately USD 7.4b. The Indian monsoon has become more severe, leading to both droughts and devastating floods. Flooding disrupts lives, damages infrastructure, and causes significant economic losses. The frequency and intensity of floods have increased in recent years due to unplanned urbanisation, deforestation, and global warming. India’s long coastline (7,500 km) is vulnerable to cyclones from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad suffer from waterlogging due to unplanned urbanisation. Major rivers like the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Yamuna frequently overflow, causing floods in Assam, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh. In 2021, Cyclone Yaas left an estimated 150,000 homeless in eastern India after destroying at least 25,000 homes. India, being an agrarian economy, is majorly impacted by climate change. Crop yields for staples like wheat, rice, and pulses are declining due to shifting rainfall patterns and extreme weather. Farmers face growing financial distress, contributing to migration and rural economic instability. **Migration due to Climate Change:** The New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) found that India experienced extreme weather events on 314 out of the 365 days in 2024, killing 2933 people and 92000 animals, destroying 8000 homes, and destroying 2m hectares of crops. The numbers could be even higher because the data was not complete, according to the organisation. Extreme weather conditions often force people living in parts of India to migrate to already overcrowded cities. The [Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC)](https://www.internal-displacement.org/news/access-to-quality-education-at-risk-for-14-million-internally-displaced-boys-and-girls/) in India estimates that there are currently about 14 million people in total who have been forced out of their homes due to climate change. Approximately 80% of India's population resides in areas highly susceptible to natural disasters, including extreme heat waves and severe flooding. In India, the expected rise in internally displaced populations (IDPs) due to climate-induced disasters is likely to exacerbate competition for essential resources like land, water, housing, and employment, particularly in urban and suburban centres. This flow could place severe stress on already overburdened infrastructure and public services. In areas with existing social, caste, or religious tensions, this increased pressure may fuel grievances, leading to localised social unrest or even triggering communal violence. Dibakar Roy/Unsplash **Forecast** - **Short-term**(Now - 3 months) - It is likely that India will experience an increase in heatwaves, particularly in northern and central India, which could lead to higher mortality rates and water shortages. - Restoration of degraded landscapes and watersheds is likely under the government’s Green India Mission, contributing to ecosystem enhancement, improved livelihoods, and climate mitigation. - **Medium-term**(3-12 months) - Despite strong frameworks, India will likely continue to struggle with the implementation of climate policies. - Unstable weather conditions over the monsoon season will likely threaten food security in India by significantly reducing the yields of staple crops like rice, wheat, and pulses. - **Long-term**(>1 year) - India will likely to face severe and worsening climate challenges in the coming decades due to rising global temperatures, extreme weather patterns, and environmental degradation. - India's climate crisis is highly likely to have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond its borders, potentially affecting regional stability, global economic systems, migration trends, and international climate cooperation.

US President Donald Trump has initiated a global trade war — politely called “reciprocal tariffs”. Tariffs are taxes that countries levy on imported goods which make them more expensive and unaffordable with the intent of encouraging domestic manufacturing. At the same time, the global economy prospers if some goods are imported from other countries where they are cheaper to produce, and satisfy domestic consumers. In return, the importing country can produce goods or technologies that serve the exporter countries. This becomes a cycle of trade flows and value chains based on comparative or even absolute advantage. President Trump, who won a second term on the slogan ‘Make America Great Again’ (MAGA), has two underlying assumptions behind his economic un-planning. One, that he can literally kickstart American manufacturing by putting high [tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/03/trumps-tariffs-the-full-list) on basic goods imported from all countries into the US. Two, he will use the instrument of [reciprocal tariffs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/); i.e., any country that puts tariffs on US goods will be subject to tariffs in return, whether those goods imported by the US are important for the US consumer or not. This, he believes, will force countries that import US goods to lower the taxes on them, so they are more affordable in the host country. By levying tariffs Trump is punishing the US consumer for past US economic policies where manufacturing was outsourced to countries with cheap labour and easily available raw materials and then imported by the US. Very often US companies themselves outsourced such manufacturing and made financial gains. Trump is also punishing other countries especially from the Global South like India, Vietnam, Indonesia, China etc. al., where cheap labour allows them to make goods at much cheaper rates than the US. This has benefited the US consumer all these years. India, along with other countries, is also a target, as Trump has imposed a [27 percent tariff](https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/donald-trump-india-tariff-exports-pharma-auto-it-aluminium-electronics-125040300300_1.html) on Indian exports into the US. The US is a major destination for Indian exports comprising about 18 percent of India’s outbound trade. The [World Trade Organization](https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/inbrief_e/inbr_e.htm), of which the US is still a part, says that imports from developing countries should see fewer tariffs to encourage equitable growth, but Trump does not care for the multilateral rules-based order and he has little interest in the growth of countries like India. Trump’s policy of reciprocal tariffs means that India will have to lower the tariffs it imposes on goods [imported from the US.](https://www.eximpedia.app/blog/major-products-export-from-usa-to-india) These tariffs were imposed by India to protect its own nascent industries. Trump has specifically pointed to these Indian tariffs as being unfair to the US. By lowering tariffs on US imports under pressure, India could see more American goods in its market, even at the cost of Indian-made goods. The Indian Government believes that lower tariffs on US Electric Vehicles (EVs) could be a good thing and seems happy to comply. But will the Indian EV manufacturers be happy? Moreover, will the Indian luxury car buyer who demands Toyota SUVs, BMWs, etc. now switch to Fords and Chevrolets? And will the Indian drinking class switch from the Glens and Scotches to American bourbons? America’s tariff war will be a setback to developing economies like India who may be forced to undo their protective tariff barriers to let in American goods and initiate a change in their consumer patterns. Even if this pleases the US, it takes away from the strategic and economic autonomy of India. Trump’s unilateral tariffs with global designs are unlikely to fulfill his mercantilist desires. International trade economist Professor [Sunanda Sen believes](https://www.networkideas.org/news-analysis/2025/03/tariff-wars/) that these reciprocal tariffs can bring in global recession, with multiple nations (including the US) in the grip of a contracting spiral of their respective GDPs. Tariffs are an old 19th Century method of protecting economies. However, post-globalisation where value chains have been internationalised, Trump’s tariffs will be highly disruptive with unintended consequences that are difficult to predict. What should countries like India do to avert being drawn into a US-led global recession? India has been opening its economy to the US and Indian businesses have struggled and managed to develop comfortable supply chains with the US. They will now have to diversify. The government needs to help small and medium enterprises and manufacturing exporters diversify to other countries and markets. The US’s [imports constitute about 15 percent](https://www.statista.com/statistics/218255/total-value-of-us-trade-in-goods-worldwide-since-2004/) of all global markets. This means that other economies receive 85 percent of the global exports. If carefully planned, the US induced tariff crisis can be averted. India has also diversified its key import sectors. India is welcoming [defense imports from](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/heres-how-indias-arms-trade-has-changed-over-the-last-15-years-12842667.html) the US with lucrative profits for US defense industries. Further, Trump has pushed India to [buying more oil](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-us-energy-ties-donald-trump-pm-narendra-modi-meeting-9835540/) and hydrocarbons from the US and India is doing that. India can leverage this for other concessions. India has been happily appeasing the US, but as these punitive tariffs show, the US wants more. The belief that by bandwagoning with the US India could have avoided punitive reciprocal tariffs has turned out to be false. It will not lead to Indian growth or economic stability. Therefore, India must work at making India great as opposed to bending over backwards for the MAGA programme. The Indian government has set up a control room to monitor the tariff issue. India has enough economists who can show the way so that India does not subordinate its core interests and growth trajectory to US interests. Economic autonomy is key to strategic autonomy, multipolarity and better development for the Indian people. _**Anuradha Chenoy**_ _is Adjunct Professor, O.P.

According to Zscaler’s “ThreatLabz 2025 Mobile, IoT, and OT Threat Report”, a staggering 26% of all mobile cyberattacks globally occur in India, making the country the top target worldwide. The report reveals that global mobile and spyware attacks have increased by 67% in just one year, while India alone saw a 38% year-on-year surge in mobile-based cybercrimes. Hackers are shifting their focus from traditional credit card scams to mobile payments and digital transactions, exploiting the rapid rise of cashless platforms. > [“Centre for Police Technology” Launched as Common Platform for Police, OEMs, and Vendors to Drive Smart Policing](https://the420.in/centre-for-police-technology-launched-as-common-platform-for-police-oems-and-vendors-to-drive-smart-policing/) ### Mobile Payments, Wallets, and Digital Transactions Under Attack Zscaler’s findings show that cybercriminals are increasingly targeting mobile devices to steal users’ banking credentials, card details, and personal data. The surge in digital wallet and UPI-based payments has created new avenues for exploitation. Fraudsters often disguise malicious programs as loan apps, investment platforms, or utility tools, tricking users into installing them. Once downloaded, these apps gain access to sensitive permissions — including camera, microphone, and file storage — allowing hackers full control of the device. ### Industrial Sectors Also Under Fire: Energy Most Affected The report notes that the threat is no longer limited to individual users. Critical industries such as energy, manufacturing, and transportation have witnessed an alarming rise in attacks. The energy sector alone experienced a 387% increase in cyber incidents compared to last year. Experts warn that such attacks pose serious risks to operational technology (OT) infrastructure, potentially disrupting essential services and industrial operations. ### Fake Apps Flood Google Play Store One of the most alarming findings is that over 200 malicious apps were identified on the Google Play Store, with a combined 42 million downloads. These apps often masquerade as productivity boosters, system cleaners, or security utilities — but in reality, they are designed to steal user data, install malware, or trigger ransomware attacks. Despite Google’s continuous monitoring and verification efforts, cybercriminals are finding new ways to list such apps on the platform, making it increasingly difficult for users to differentiate between genuine and fake applications. ### Expert View: Prof. Triveni Singh (Ex-IPS), Cybercrime Expert Renowned cybercrime expert and former IPS officer Professor Triveni Singh said the spike in mobile-related cybercrimes in India is a “direct outcome of rapid digital adoption combined with a lack of cyber awareness.” According to him, > “Almost every individual today owns a smartphone, but very few understand digital safety. Clicking on fake links or downloading fraudulent apps has become the new ‘digital trap’. Hackers no longer just steal money — they steal identities, data, and even manipulate victims psychologically. Until users practice cyber discipline, no technology can fully protect them.” Prof. Singh further noted that mobile-based fraud in India has now evolved into a form of organized crime. He emphasized that the response must go beyond technology — India needs a policy-level and awareness-driven approach. He also suggested launching a nationwide Mobile Cyber Hygiene Campaign in collaboration with the government and tech companies to educate citizens about safe digital practices and mobile security. ### The Road Ahead: Smartphone Security Must Be a National Priority With mobile penetration and digital payments accelerating at record speed, India’s rising share in global cyberattacks is a warning bell. The report makes it clear — the next battleground for cybersecurity is the smartphone itself. Both the government and private sector must strengthen system-level safeguards, while users must take responsibility for their own digital hygiene. The message for India is clear — digital convenience must go hand in hand with digital caution, because your smartphone is now your first line of defense.

REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis ###### Follow topic: India Published Oct 30, 2025, 09:21 PM Updated Oct 30, 2025, 09:21 PM HYDERABAD, India - A severe cyclone that battered India's eastern coast this week caused damage estimated at nearly 53 billion rupees ($603 million), as farms, roads and buildings were flooded in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, authorities said on Thursday. Cyclone Montha made landfall on the coast of Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday night, bringing heavy rain and gusty winds that damaged crops and utility poles, uprooted trees and left several areas under water. An early damage assessment indicated that the farm sector suffered the highest losses at 8.68 billion rupees, the state government said, adding that the storm also killed 120 animals. \"No human casualties were reported from the cyclone,\" state Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu said, although local media reported that two women had died. Heavy rain brought by the cyclone also lashed the neighbouring state of Telangana, causing flooding that persisted on Thursday. Visuals from news agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake, showed people wading through knee-deep water carrying belongings they had salvaged in their hands or balanced on their heads. Other images showed rescue workers carrying residents pulled out of flooded areas to safer ground. The cyclone should continue to weaken into a low-pressure area over the next 24 hours, India's weather department said on Thursday evening. Cyclones frequently hit India's east coast between April and December. A super cyclone that killed nearly 10,000 people when it struck the eastern state of Odisha in 1999 remains one of the country's deadliest natural disasters.

On Nov. 11, a suicide bombing killed at least 12 people and injured 36 outside the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. While the Afghanistan-based Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group denied responsibility, a hard-line TTP faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), subsequently claimed the attack and said it targeted \"the judges, lawyers, and other staff who enforce Pakistan's un-Islamic laws.\" Pakistani authorities are still investigating \"all aspects\" of the bombing, though some top officials have suggested it occurred with Indian support, with Pakistan's prime minister attributing the attack to India-backed militants, and the country's interior minister claiming \"Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" were... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. ## Document Type Book ## Publication Date 10-2016 ## Publisher National Defense University Press ## City Washington, DC ## Recommended Citation Lynch, Thomas F.

USAID @ The Asia Foundation LS FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE Improving Lives, Expanding Opportunities INDIA-U.S. TRIANGULAR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 01 The Asia Foundation, 2022, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey - Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. The Asia Foundation: New Delhi Disclaimer This report is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the ‘India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) at The Asia Foundation. The opinions expressed here are solely of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government and The Asia Foundation. 02 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Foreword India and the U.S. share a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region. India’s long\u0002standing engagement in the region makes it a strong development partner and leader. The Asia Foundation through its India- U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a program funded by USAID, is working toward realizing this vision and strengthening India’s and the U.S.’s development cooperation footprint in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The program builds on the U.S. government’s commitment to strengthen triangular partnership programs with India in the Indo-Pacific region and is informed by the U.S. government’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and its Pacific Islands Strategy. TriDeP seeks to support the Government of India’s development assistance in the Indo\u0002Pacific region by identifying countries keen to expand their development partnership with India in sectors defined by their country needs, and by supporting programming based on such identification. Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Smart Agriculture and Renewable Energy are sectors where India demonstrates policy leadership and technical skills, and thus can provide sustainable solutions. This report presents a diagnostic study that maps India’s capabilities in disaster management, as well as identifying opportunities for India and the developing countries in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and South Asia to partner for promising solutions. Over the years, India’s disaster management approach has evolved rapidly to respond to the slew of challenges posed by a range of disasters. India’s diverse geo-climatic conditions make it vulnerable to multiple natural and human\u0002caused disasters, thus prompting the country to develop tailored policies and frameworks for coordinated multi-stakeholder disaster-risk reduction efforts. TriDeP seeks to leverage India’s know-how in disaster management, by sharing technical expertise and knowledge and supporting local adaptation, to improve resilience and preparedness against disasters in the Indo\u0002Pacific region. TriDeP aims to do this in close collaboration with a range of stakeholders, including governments, communities, and the private sector, through cost-effective and context-specific solutions. This diagnostic identifies India’s expertise in establishing well-defined institutional systems; legislative, policy and planning frameworks; robust search and rescue capabilities; improved early warning systems; technological advancements for disaster risk management; improved emergency communication; expanded disaster resource and knowledge networks; emergency operations centers; enhanced response capabilities and systems; and post-disaster mental health management. The study also identifies opportunities for India-U.S. triangular cooperation across several countries in the Indo-Pacific region. While the diagnostic study was underway, the Covid-19 virus struck with severity unimagined in a century and has brought to the fore the disastrous dimensions of pandemics, including psychological and physical health challenges that require concerted medical responses to India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 03 address them. Several participants in a virtual meeting of experts from the Indo-Pacific region to discuss the study expressed interest in the knowledge and expertise of India in psychosocial care and telemedicine health services, both important focus areas that help to address pandemic-related health issues. I would like to thank Balaji Singh Chowhan, who is the lead author and researcher for this report and an expert in disaster managenment. I would like to thank Veena Reddy, USAID/ India and Bhutan Mission Director; Karen Klimowski, Deputy Mission Director; John Smith-Sreen, Director of the Indo-Pacific Office; MaryTyler E.

Sen Pilgrims being rescued from Badrinath after the 2021 Uttarakhand flood. 10 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey I ndia, due to its unique geo-climatic conditions, is vulnerable to multiple natural and human-caused disasters, such as droughts, floods, earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, hailstorms, cold waves, heat waves, glacier lake outburst floods, wildfires, oil spills, and other major pollution events. The country’s journey toward holistic and modern disaster risk reduction (DRR) practices began more than 20 years ago, when several natural disasters resulted in thousands of deaths and enormous economic losses. These disasters spurred India toward a more comprehensive DRR approach, eventually leading the country to tremendous disaster management progress: Subsequent disasters have resulted in minimized deaths and losses because of India’s effective DRR efforts. Over the course of the past two decades, India’s disaster management approach evolved from a reactive, search-and-rescue, and relief-centered approach primarily centered on flood and drought to a proactive, holistic approach that includes prevention, mitigation, preparedness, capacity building, risk reduction, technological investment and advancements, community involvement, and risk resilience for a far wider range of hazards. Holistic disaster management requires mainstreaming DRR into policies, institutions, infrastructure, and logistics in order to develop tools for effective and efficient action. India developed DRR policies for multiple stakeholders by integrating inputs from domain experts and all levels of governments and communities; it also increased response effectiveness through international coalitions, and coordinated risk reduction capabilities at the national and local levels. India’s holistic DRR efforts involve robust legal frameworks; effective policy design and development; domestic policy and institutional coherence; a focus on capacity building, expert input, and knowledge sharing; well-oiled administrative mechanisms; an ability to prevent or mitigate disasters before they occur, as well as effective and inclusive rescue and recovery operations. India’s disaster management learning curve owes a great deal to how India adapted crucial disaster management elements from other countries to India’s own context. Now, other countries have the opportunity to emulate India’s DRR journey in order to accelerate their own efforts, thereby saving thousands of lives and millions in economic losses. India has multiple bilateral and multilateral DRR relationships with other countries, such as the United States, Switzerland, Australia, Russia, the European Commission, and United Nations agencies. Given this international cooperation framework already in place and India’s extensive DRR capabilities, it would be hugely beneficial for India to branch out to additional triangular cooperation (TrC) initiatives, especially partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which already has a strong DRR backbone with India. These TrC initiatives would be led by India as the primary source of expertise and technical assistance and could also benefit from the involvement of several United States agencies and private-sector or nongovernmental organizations. India’s South-South development cooperation model would thus be considerably enhanced, with the triangulation of efforts between India and the United States increasing India’s development assistance footprint in the developing countries of the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. This report begins with an explanation of India’s 20-year journey from search and rescue\u0002related crisis management to prevention, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 11 mitigation, and preparedness, setting the groundwork for how India’s experiences can be adapted to other countries’ own disaster management contexts. The second chapter details the interplay between India’s DRR strategy, legislation, policy interventions, disaster management administration and institutions, and its perspectives on gender equity and social inclusion in DRR efforts. Chapter three breaks down how India can share its knowledge and DRR capabilities through the country’s multiple DRR technologies and capacity-building institutions, including centers of excellence for training in general disaster management and early warning systems; specialized institutions for search and rescue and disaster assessment, mitigation, and planning; private- and nongovernmental organization\u0002run training institutes; Incident Command System adaptations; risk communication and language adaptations; and equipment stocks and suppliers. The fourth chapter outlines the DRR status of three Indo-Pacific sub-regions: South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indo-Pacific Islands, and briefly discusses the potential DRR needs of ideal TrC partners. Chapter five concludes with a discussion about the viability of TrC initiatives, and makes recommendations for suitable TrC activities in 10 Indo-Pacific countries. About the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) India, The Asia Foundation is implementing the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a three-year program in support of the United States’ and India’s mutual aims in the Indo\u0002Pacific Region. In a ground-breaking initiative to catalyze North-South-South triangular cooperation (TrC) throughout an entire region – the Indo-Pacific – rather than with a single country, the TriDeP program will facilitate partnerships between India, the United States, and several South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Indo-Pacific Island countries.1 The TriDeP program has identified three priority areas where India can share its proven expertise: disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate-smart agriculture, and renewable energy. The TriDeP program team selected DRR for its inaugural research initiative to explore how and where India’s demonstrated DRR policy leadership, practical experience, and sustainable results can be shared with countries in the region. After assessing India’s DRR capacities and capabilities and matching them to the needs and capabilities of potential Indo-Pacific partner countries, the TriDeP program will develop demand-driven, context-specific TrC projects that combine Indian experience and Photographer: Saikiran Kesari Stranded citizens making their way through the flooded streets of Mumbai, India during the 2020 Mumbai floods. 12 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey expertise with Indian and American technical assistance, drawing on India’s centers of excellence, training institutions, relevant private sector entities, and nongovernmental and civil society organizations. Research Objectives The TriDeP program team undertook action research on India’s DRR institutions and capabilities in order to understand the Indian\u0002Indo-Pacific DRR landscape, identify DRR needs in potential beneficiary countries, highlight areas of India’s DRR expertise that could be shared, suggest priority partners and projects for initial TrC implementations, and determine suitable activities to support project design and implementation. Research Methodology The action research for this report took place from January through June 2021. The research process began with a thorough review of the literature followed by nine telephone and seven in-person interviews with 16 Indian government representatives, technical specialists, and practitioners experienced in DRR and disaster management in order to gain a preliminary overview of India’s current capabilities – what we will call the “supply-side” of DRR (see Annexure 1 for participant list). The study also involved extensive desk research to gather background information about India’s supply-side capabilities. The supply-side research also involved convening a group of 17 experts from India, including independent DRR experts, leaders of DRR civil society organizations (CSOs) working in India, and current and retired government functionaries who lead or have led India’s disaster responses. These experts were joined by six supporting Photographer: Dr. Ashok K A Doppler Radar meteorological geodesic dome atop a hillock at Vishakhapatnam, India. India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 13 staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 2 for participant list). The supply-side research was complemented by what we will call “demand-side” desk research about Indo-Pacific countries’ geographies and their disaster exposures, histories, institutional and technical capabilities, current disaster\u0002aid partnerships, and relevant socioeconomic profiles. The desk research was enhanced through discussions with a group of 39 experts in the fields of DRR and climate change impacts; these experts represented countries, states, or organizations from Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Germany, India, Nepal, United Kingdom, United Nations, United States, and international nongovernmental and civil society organizations. These experts were joined by seven supporting staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 3 for participant list). The demand-side experts discussed DRR needs as perceived by countries in the region, identified geopolitical interests or sensitivities, and postulated supply-demand matches. Since Covid-19 pandemic restrictions prevented in-person meetings, both supply- and demand-side convenings took place online and lasted about two hours each. During the demand-side convening, the Covid-19 pandemic prompted requests from some Indo-Pacific countries for assistance with health- and psychosocial-care needs to combat and counter the effects of the pandemic. Although the TriDeP team did not focus on pandemic disasters in the initial research phases, this report describes some of India’s supply-side telemedicine and psychosocial-care capabilities that could match demand-side requests for pandemic- and other health-related cooperation projects. Drawing on the desk research, interviews, and discussions with the TriDeP program team, and his own extensive experience in the field and personal familiarity with the actors, the author identifies 10 countries as potential TrC candidates and indicates their potential needs for equipment, services, and technical assistance that would increase the effectiveness of disaster risk management and response. In his selection of potential match countries, the author also considered complementary and competing DRR programs and activities already in progress with other providers. The author cautions, of course, that all DRR assistance proposals should align with host government priorities and that all recommended disaster management solutions must be fine-tuned and based on further contextual analyses. Pertinent facts about the 10 potential match countries and possible TrC initiatives are detailed in Annexure 4, which covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Fiji, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Maldives, the Philippines, Nepal, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. In addition, the author presents disaster risk profiles for 16 other Indo-Pacific Region countries that may become candidates for TrC in the future: Brunei, Cook Islands, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, and Vanuatu (Annexure 5). The author’s TrC recommendations are consistent with the Intermediate Result (IR) 3.1 of the USAID India Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS).2 The Asia Foundation is a non-profit international development organization committed to improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia. Informed by six decades of experience and deep local expertise, its work across the region addresses five overarching goals – strengthen governance, empower women, expand economic opportunity, increase environmental resilience, and promote international cooperation. The TriDeP creates an opportunity for The Asia Foundation to examine emerging cross-cutting critical issues, such as disaster risk reduction, that warrant deeper investigation to inform its program strategies to ensure the Foundation remains at the leading edge of changing dynamics in the regional context – geopolitical, environmental, and legal/regulatory – and well-positioned to tackle the most critical issues facing Asia.

To be effective, all these elements must come together as a seamless whole. The policies, institutions, and logistics of disaster management are as important as the actual equipment used to rescue people – absolutely vital in handling disasters, in reaching to the last mile, and in determining the tools for effective and efficient action. Equally important is the involvement of disaster management practitioners in policy design and development – the domain and subject matter experts who understand the complexity and who know how to make disaster management policies, institutions, and logistics work together most effectively. Effective disaster management usually requires a long phase of development; time is the main challenge in setting up vital elements. Experts see India’s present disaster management approach as a journey that lasted just over two decades. It began at the time of super Cyclone Photographer: Fernando Quevedo de Oliveira Forest fires above Thak village in Uttarakhand, India in May, 2016. 16 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey ‘The Government of India and other stakeholders implemented recommenda- tions from a High Powered Committee (HPC). ‘The HPC’s report guided India’s disaster managernent approach from a relief-centric approach to one that embrac- es prevention, mitigation, and preparedness. fo strengthen India’s approach, the HPC. also made other recommendations: linking development efforts to disaster reduction; estab- lishing a disaster knowledge network, promoting interna- tional cooperation; applying a national disaster mitigation strat adopting a commu- nity-based approach; and fostering a culture of preven- tive thinking, The enactment of the National Disast ment Act and the de lop- ment of a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and state- and district-level disaster n ‘ nt authorities (SDMAs and DDMAs) set the stage for India’s National Institute m of Disaster Management (NIDM) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 17 The National Policy on Disaster Management (2009) motivated community-based disaster management, last-mile integration of policy and plans, executional capacity development, consolidation of past initia- tives, deployment of best prs agencies at national and tices, cooperation with international levels, and multi-sectoral synergies. First announced in Novem- ber 2016 during the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, the Prime Minister's Ten Point Agenda restated DRR priorities, such as bolstering local capacities, enhancing, knowledge networks, and supporting international coalitions. The 2016 National Disaster Management Plan, subse- quently updated in 2019, provided a [ramework for disaster management plans at the ministerial, depart mental, state, and district levels. The Plan set out mechanisms for multiagency coordina- tion: the National Executive Committee (NEC), headed by the Ministry of Home Affairs Secretary at the national level, and the State Executive headed by a Chief Secretary mmiittee, at the state-government level.",

That Could Backfire. Even if New Delhi secures tactical gains, the strategic losses could be enduring. Link copied by [Ashley J. Tellis](https://carnegieendowment.org/people/ashley-j-tellis?lang=en) Published on April 9, 2025 _This piece is part of a_ [_Carnegie series_](https://carnegieendowment.org/trumps-disruptive-100-days?lang=en) _examining the impacts of Trump’s first 100 days in office._ The tumultuous 100 days after Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency have been disruptive for the United States and the world. Despite New Delhi’s feigned optimism, U.S.-Indian relations have been disturbed as well. For a quarter century now, bilateral ties between Washington and New Delhi had been dramatically improving, as successive U.S. administrations—including Trump’s during his first term—wooed India in the context of the competition with China. The embrace of India intensified during Joe Biden’s presidency, when New Delhi was viewed as an intimate collaborator in Washington’s efforts at confronting Beijing. Consequently, India’s domestic illiberalism and trade mercantilism were discounted as administration officials sought to build new partnerships in high technology, entice businesses diversifying from China to invest in India, and position India as a new manufacturing node to limit China’s industrial dominance. These goals aligned perfectly with India’s own ambitions to expand its national power, which had the virtue of—at least transitorily—aiding the United States to cement its geopolitical dominance and protect the liberal international order. Trump’s return has altered the traditional direction of U.S. grand strategy in dramatic ways. His administration’s striking contempt for the liberal order is now clear, but it is also accompanied by atavistic attempts at [territorial expansionism](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/07/politics/trump-expansion-ideas-what-matters/index.html), the imposition of [“reciprocal” tariffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/economy/trump-tariffs-chart.html) on U.S. trading partners, and [confrontations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/world/trump-foreign-policy-trust.html) with many U.S. allies worldwide. In this environment, India has, first and foremost, sought to protect its past bilateral gains by seeking to mollify Trump through conciliatory public diplomacy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his senior aides rushed to Washington to meet the president in a highly choreographed [display of bonhomie](https://apnews.com/article/trump-india-modi-visit-washington-tariffs-83d5f6af65f923dc4feb3f38338c888d), attempting to reassure him that unlike many of his other national targets, India is neither a free-loading ally nor a foe and would be a valuable partner in his “Make America Great Again” efforts. Beyond lavishly congratulating Trump for attempting to end the Ukraine war, Modi even offered a cheesy public endorsement of MAGA with a twist intended to protect India’s equities—all intended to deflect the ravages of Trump’s new policies. These policy changes matter for India. In a striking departure from the past, Trump’s behavior has underscored that he does not think much of India in the context of U.S. rivalry with China. His administration may have other ideas—which could surface in time—but for the moment, Trump is obsessed with correcting America’s trade deficits, which makes India a juicy target. Recognizing this priority, Indian policymakers have moved in two directions: seeking to conclude an [interim trade agreement](https://www.reuters.com/world/india-us-making-progress-towards-trade-deal-officials-say-2025-03-29/) that would hopefully mitigate Trump’s reciprocal levies (which now involve a 26 percent tariff on India), and offering [assurances](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/government-plans-to-amend-nuclear-liability-law-in-spotlight-as-modi-heads-to-us-france-this-week/article69198583.ece) that India’s problematic nuclear liability law will be amended to permit U.S. nuclear reactor exports to India. These solutions and others are driven by the imperative of protecting India’s relationship with the United States in the changed circumstances—a partnership that is vital both for India’s economic growth through continued access to the U.S. market and for geopolitical assurance in the face of India’s continued distrust of China. That Washington now shows little interest in protecting the international order also poses new challenges to India. Although its leaders sometimes discount the value of the existing system—mostly because it has not fully accommodated India’s status claims—they have moved quickly to bolster other international relationships as supplements to the United States. India’s hedging amid the current uncertainties has assumed different dimensions, including efforts to conclude a [free-trade agreement with the European Union](https://apnews.com/article/india-eu-modi-ursula-von-der-leyen-309ab4795ad0206b66fe20bef5ca9a92) and to strengthen ties with key European partners more generally; willingness to explore [resuscitating ties with China](https://www.firstpost.com/world/india-china-seek-to-rebuild-ties-with-3-fold-formula-on-75th-anniversary-of-diplomatic-relations-13876454.html); determination to preserve [India’s traditional relationship with Russia](https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-india-responding-trump-five-takeaways-trip-new-delhi); and persistent [strengthening of ties](https://theprint.in/opinion/indias-multi-alignment-realpolitik-is-no-strategic-foolishness-consider-economic-realities/2183576/) with Australia, Israel, Japan, the wealthy Arab states, and the Global South. While Indian policymakers are astute enough to recognize that Trump’s disruptive policies could impose serious costs on New Delhi, they have nonetheless [publicly touted](https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/trumps-shift-towards-multipolarity-and-global-collaboration-benefits-india-jaishankar/3768869/) the benefits of his disorder while seeking to exploit its opportunities. For example, the administration’s dismantling of the U.S. bureaucracy and its aversion to export controls have created new openings for India to acquire controlled technologies that were previously unavailable. Similarly, New Delhi views the United States’s attacks on its alliances and on international institutions as expanding the prospects for the emergence of multipolarity and, by implication, creating new space for India’s arrival as a great power. But this expectation is illusory. The destruction of the liberal international order does not presage multipolarity but rather consolidates the bipolarity that will subsist amid increasing entropy in global politics. Trump’s policies will enhance the conditions for China’s continued rise, increase its legitimacy as a responsible power, and—by burdening India’s development prospects and damaging U.S. alliances along the way—undermine the countervailing forces that could coherently resist Beijing when needed. As a result, China will join the United States as a true great power, and despite not matching up fully, both nations will stand apart from the rest of the international system in terms of sheer capabilities for several decades to come. Whether this outcome really serves India’s interests remains to be seen, and even if New Delhi opportunistically secures some tactical gains as a result of Trump’s turbulence, the strategic losses it suffers could be enduring. _Read more from_ [_this series_](https://carnegieendowment.org/trumps-disruptive-100-days?lang=en) _, including:_ - [Saudi Arabia Has Outsized Influence in Washington.

As global supply chains evolve and geopolitical priorities shift, India's ability to strike the right balance will define its role in the 21st-century economic order. - Anand Kumar& Rajat Mehrotra - [ETGovernment](https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/88675781/ETGovernment) - Updated On Apr 22, 2025 at 11:02 AM IST - - Copy Link - Share on WhatsApp - Share on Linkedin - Share on X - Share on Telegram - Share on Facebook The Trump 26% tariff challenge is more than a trade issue; it tests India's economic diplomacy, industrial resilience, and global strategy.On April 2, 2025, United States President Donald Trump declared a series of tariffs under the \"Liberation Day\" program to address the perceived trade imbalances and to protect America’s domestic industries. The tariff imposed on Indian imports was a significant 26%, which is higher than the rates imposed on the European Union (20%) and the United Kingdom (10%), but lower than those applied to South Asian neighbours like Vietnam (46%) and China (54%). These actions aim to encourage Americans to buy \"Made in America\" products, which would significantly boost domestic production. Advt Experts indicate that this strategic move demonstrates the U.S. intention to reshape global trade dynamics, supporting domestic industries while urging trading partners to reduce their tariffs.President Trump mentioned that India, although a great friend of the US, has a \"very high\" tariff averaging 52% on US items, which Trump termed as unfair trade practices. Mentioned in his address, \"India, very very tough. Very very tough. The Prime Minister-He's a great friend of mine, but I said, 'You're a friend of mine, but you're not treating us right. They charge us 52%\". According to the [United Nations COMTRADE database](https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/united+nations+comtrade+database), in 2023, India's exports to the United States totalled approximately $75.81 billion, with key sectors including precious metals, fuels, and electrical machinery. However, in the fiscal year 2022-23, India's imports from the United States amounted to approximately $42.12 billion. This bilateral trade stood at $33.69 billion in India's favour during 2023–24, which Trump perceived as an unfair trade practice. For India, the short-term economic impact consists of lessening export competitiveness, with Indian goods becoming more expensive in US markets. Following the tariff announcement on Wednesday (2 April 2025), the Indian stock market declined by more than 500 points. Experts project a potential 0.5% reduction in India’s GDP growth due to export slowdowns, alongside inflationary risks from pricier imports of machinery and energy. However, sectors like gems and jewellery (8.5 billion), telecom instruments (6.5 billion, textiles (2.8 billion), and auto parts are already under a 25% pre-existing tariff in the US. Advt The tariffs also have spillover impacts on the international trade environment. The [World Trade Organization](https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/world+trade+organization) (WTO) foresees a 1% decline in global merchandise trade due to countries' retaliatory measures and supply chain disruptions. However, higher tariffs on countries like Vietnam and Thailand (46% and 36%, respectively) may divert exports to alternative markets, intensifying competition for India in regions like the EU. Despite these challenges, the tariffs present long-term opportunities for India. The US tariffs on rival manufacturing hubs like China and Vietnam could accelerate supply chain diversification, positioning India as a preferred destination for sectors such as textiles, electronics, and engineering goods. For instance, India's smartphone exports, which surged to 6 billion following Apple's local assembly initiatives, may benefit as competitors face higher US tariffs through reliance on imported components from tariff−hit nations like China. Also, to capitalize on the tariff war, India must prioritize domestic reforms, such as enhancing logistics efficiency (ranked 44th globally by the [World Bank](https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/world+bank)) and expanding Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes to foster scale and innovation in manufacturing.As India looks to maintain its growth trajectory while navigating geopolitical uncertainties, the 26% tariff challenge presents both a significant hurdle and an opportunity for recalibration. **Why This Tariff Matters to India** India is among the top 10 trading partners of the US, and the US remains India’s largest export destination. A sudden and steep 26% tariff essentially makes Indian goods costlier and less competitive in the US market. This has already triggered market volatility: On April 7, 2025, the Nifty 50 fell 3.24% and the Sensex lost 2.95%, the worst single-day decline in 10 months. Shares of Tata Motors plunged 10% after its luxury unit Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) paused exports to the US. Pharma majors like [Sun Pharma](https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/sun+pharma) and Dr. Reddy’s saw their stocks fall 4-6%, fearing loss of market share in the American generics space. **Key Sectors at Risk** 1\\. PharmaceuticalsIndia’s generic drug exports to the US exceed $11 billion annually. The US accounts for about 35% of India’s total pharma exports. The proposed 26% import tariff on these products could significantly advantage local US drug manufacturers, while compelling Indian firms to cut costs and profit margins just to maintain their competitiveness. This trade tariff war could pose a serious threat to key players in the industry, including Cipla, Lupin, and [Aurobindo Pharma](https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/aurobindo+pharma), who may struggle to adapt in this evolving landscape.2. Textiles and ApparelThe Indian textile industry exports nearly $8.3 billion of products to the US. Despite the new tariffs on Indian goods, we can expect the Indian textile and apparel industry to be least affected because of neighbouring markets such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, where new tariffs are 37 and 46 per cent, respectively.3. IT ServicesWhile software exports are often exempt from physical tariffs, indirect barriers like increased visa restrictions, data localization, and higher service taxes may accompany the tariff move. Major Indian IT companies such as Infosys, TCS, and [Wipro](https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/wipro), which generate over 60% of their revenue from North America, could feel the heat. This impact is reflected in the decline of their market share prices.4. Automotive and Auto ComponentsThe export of auto parts and two-wheelers to the US, totalling $2.6 billion in 2023, is set to face significant challenges. Tata Motors has been particularly hard hit, as Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has suspended shipments. This strategic move is poised to dramatically impact the company's revenues and profit margins **Economic Forecast: Reasons for Caution, but Not All Is Negative** India’s Finance Ministry has stated that the country’s GDP growth projection of 6.5% to 6.8% for FY2025-26 remains unchanged. However, private economists have trimmed their forecasts by 20-40 basis points, citing export uncertainty and potential job losses. According to CRISIL, up to 30 lakh jobs across MSMEs in textile, handicrafts, and engineering goods may be at risk if demand from the US sharply contracts. States like Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Punjab, and Maharashtra—key export hubs—could be hit hard. **What’s India Doing About It?** Current Strategy: Patience + NegotiationIn February 2025, India and the US agreed to expedite negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement by autumn 2025. Officials say this is a critical opportunity to resolve structural issues like market access, tariff mismatches, and digital trade. “Retaliation would have been premature. We believe engagement is the better option,” said a senior commerce ministry official. India is also strengthening lobbying efforts via its US-India Business Council ( [USIBC](https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/usibc)) partnerships and trade missions to American states. **Long-term Strategic Moves India Can Make** 1\\. Diversify Export MarketsIndia must reduce overdependence on the US, which constitutes 17% of its total exports. Expanding trade ties with Europe, Africa, ASEAN, Japan, and Latin America is going to be crucial. India has recently inked early trade deals with the UAE and Australia. Ongoing talks with the EU and the UK can be accelerated to create alternate export channels.2. Attract Global Supply ChainsThe government is banking on its Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes across 14 sectors to attract multinational firms looking to “China+1” their operations. If successful, India can become a major manufacturing and re-export hub, reducing exposure to tariff risks.3. Boost Domestic CompetitivenessInvesting in infrastructure, skill development, innovation, and logistics efficiency is essential. Indian goods must compete on quality and delivery, not just low labour cost. The National Logistics Policy and Make in India 2.0 are aimed at addressing these gaps. **What’s at Stake for the US?** While Trump’s tariffs are politically driven, they may backfire economically. US importers and consumers may face higher costs on essential goods like medicines, auto parts, and textiles. According to the US Chamber of Commerce, Indian generics saved US consumers $20 billion in 2023 alone. Over 200,000 American jobs are supported by Indian IT firms operating locally in the U.S. Several US companies with supply chains tied to India have expressed concern over rising input costs and delays. **Conclusion: Reset or Risk?** The Trump 26% tariff challenge is more than a trade issue; it tests India's economic diplomacy, industrial resilience, and global strategy. While it presents real risks for exporters and markets in the short term, it also offers a chance to pivot toward a more diversified, self-reliant, globally competitive export model. By staying measured, accelerating reforms, and forging smarter trade pacts, India can weather this storm and emerge stronger. As global supply chains evolve and geopolitical priorities shift, India's ability to strike the right balance will define its role in the 21st-century economic order. _**(The authors are part of academia; Views expressed are personal)**_ - By Anand Kumar& Rajat Mehrotra, - [ETGovernment](https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/88675781/ETGovernment) - Published On Apr 22, 2025 at 11:02 AM IST - - Telegram - Facebook - Copy Link ## Comments What are your thoughts?

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government's announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture.

Dubbed \"Liberation Day\" by the president, this move introduces a baseline 10% tariff on imports from most countries, with higher rates targeted at specific nations and industries.** During a press conference in the Rose Garden, President Trump justified the tariffs as essential for addressing longstanding trade imbalances and revitalizing domestic manufacturing. He described the global trade system as exploitative, accusing foreign nations of \"pillaging\" American taxpayers for decades. The new tariffs are intended to generate hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for the US government while promoting domestic production across key industries such as steel, aluminum, and automotive manufacturing. Among the most notable measures are a 34% tariff on Chinese goods, 20% on imports from the European Union, and a 25% tariff on imported automobiles. These actions are poised to reshape international trade dynamics and have profound implications for the US economy. India emerged as a focal point in these tariff measures, which impose a 26% “reciprocal tariff” on Indian goods entering the US. President Trump cited India’s historically high duties on American goods, labeling the country a “tariff king.” He pointed to disparities such as India’s 52% tariff on US goods compared to America’s previous average rate of 3.7% on Indian imports. While President Trump described Indian PM Narendra Modi as a “great friend,” he emphasized that these tariffs aim to create a more balanced trade relationship rather than targeting specific nations

**Impact of US Reciprocal Tariffs on India** The immediate impact of these tariffs is expected to be felt across several key sectors of Indian exports, including pharmaceuticals, processed foods, machinery, and textiles. For example, processed food exports—valued at $1.03 billion (88.12 billion INR) last year—face significant disruptions due to tariff disparities exceeding 24%. Sectors like electronics and agriculture are also vulnerable; shrimp and dairy products could see tariffs rise as high as 28%. However, some industries such as petroleum and garments may experience relatively limited effects. Despite these challenges, India’s economy is considered somewhat insulated from severe repercussions due to its diversified export strategies and relatively low reliance on external demand. According to an SBI Research report, the overall impact of Trump’s tariffs on Indian exports would be modest, with projections suggesting a reduction of approximately 3% to 3.5%. This resilience stems from India’s emphasis on value addition and exploration of alternative markets through new trade routes connecting Europe to the US via the Middle East.

Nevertheless, concerns remain about long-term consequences for India’s trade relationship with the US, its largest trading partner. While ongoing negotiations between the two nations aim to double bilateral trade volume to $500 billion (42.8 trillion INR) by 2030, these new tariffs risk complicating progress toward finalizing agreements that address mutual grievances over market access and tariff barriers. Additionally, India’s reliance on imported energy and machinery raises fears that widespread trade conflicts could increase import costs, leading to inflationary pressures domestically. **President Trump’s Global Tariff Strategy** Internationally, Trump’s tariff strategy risks igniting retaliatory trade wars. Trading partners such as Canada, China, and the European Union already announced counter-tariffs targeting US exports. These retaliatory measures threaten to further destabilize global markets and erode alliances that have underpinned economic stability since World War II. The CEPII Working Paper estimates that a full-blown trade war could reduce world GDP by 0.5% and global trade volume by 3.4%. The ripple effects extend beyond economics into geopolitics; by imposing tariffs indiscriminately—even on allies—the Trump administration risks alienating key partners while undermining multilateral cooperation. Domestically, reactions to President Trump’s tariffs have been mixed. While some view them as necessary steps toward leveling the playing field in international trade, others criticize them as regressive taxes that hurt American consumers more than foreign competitors. Business leaders have expressed alarm at the uncertainty created by these policies; over 30% of firms surveyed in early 2025 ranked trade issues as their top concern—a sharp increase from previous quarters. For India specifically, experts remain optimistic about potential silver linings amidst these challenges. The Global Trade Research Initiative notes that additional duties imposed by the U.S. on other countries—such as Canada—could make their products less competitive globally, creating opportunities for Indian exporters in sectors like pharmaceuticals and auto components. However, these benefits depend heavily on India's production capacity and ability to scale operations quickly. As these tariffs take effect over the coming weeks—beginning with automobile levies on April 3—the global economy faces an uncertain future. Whether Trump’s gamble will yield long-term benefits for American industry or plunge the world into deeper economic turmoil remains to be seen. For India, navigating this complex landscape will require balancing its domestic priorities with aspirations for deeper integration into global markets while mitigating inflationary risks and maintaining fiscal stability. What is clear is that this bold move marks a pivotal moment in U.S.-India trade relations—one with consequences that will reverberate far beyond their borders for years to come. ### Contribute Your Story Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(ANNIRUDHA MOOKERJEE/AFP/Getty Images) For more than two months, Chinese and Indian forces have stood toe to toe on the Doklam Plateau. The standoff is just the latest manifestation of a border dispute that began long before Chinese soldiers tried to extend a road through the contested region June 16 -- and one that extends well past the area in question. Along the thousands of kilometers of sinuous border between China and India lie three main points of contention: Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The regions are the most likely sites of a military confrontation between China and India, and each presents its own set of strategic considerations....

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://frontline.thehindu.com?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ## Stories that help you connect the dots ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

    "full_text": "[Skip to navigation](https://www.project-syndicate.org/www.project-syndicate.org#navigation) [Skip to main content](https://www.project-syndicate.org/www.project-syndicate.org#main) Kin Cheung/WPA/Pool/Getty Images [Economics](https://www.project-syndicate.org/section/economics) - 0 # Trump’s Tariffs and India’s Economic Future Aug 25, 2025[Ajay Shah](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ajay-shah) US President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on India will likely cause some immediate economic damage. But the greater risk is that they will prompt the Indian government to turn inward, when it would be better off seeking new international partners and reaffirming its commitment to the globalized economy that has served it so well. NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s [decision](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/trump-imposes-extra-25-tariff-indian-goods-ties-hit-new-low-2025-08-06/) to impose new tariffs on a wide range of imports from India, ostensibly a penalty for buying Russian oil, represents another shock to the international trading system – and a sharp [reversal of good relations with](https://www.ft.com/content/ab6af773-6ca1-468c-9a79-e41482c5457e) Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. These tariffs could disrupt the Indian economy, which has benefited immensely from global integration. But the greater risk lies in their potential to influence the country’s long-term strategic direction. To be sure, several factors will mitigate the immediate impact of Trump’s tariffs. Despite being India’s largest trading partner, the United States is a distant country, and high transport costs have led India to diversify its trade relationships. Moreover, international markets are not static, and Trump’s global tariff war will redirect trade flows and reconfigure supply chains all over the world. Indian exporters – like their counterparts in other countries – will invariably find new markets, though the transition costs implied by this shift are likely to be high. Consider also that the new US tariffs [apply to roughly $65 billion](https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/president-trumps-50-tariff-on-india-will-impact-65-billion-worth-of-merchandise-exports-to-the-united-states) in annual merchandise exports from India. With the country’s total merchandise exports reaching [around $441 billion in the last fiscal year](https://economicoutlook.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wshreport&repcode=048008005000000000000000000000000000000000000&repnum=19646&frequency=A&icode=&oporder=2), the affected goods constitute less than 15% of these trade flows. While not insignificant, this figure is unlikely to cripple India’s export economy. A narrow focus on merchandise also overlooks the most dynamic component of India’s trade portfolio: services. With annual services exports [now exceeding $380 billion](https://economicoutlook.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wshreport&repcode=048008005000000000000000000000000000000000000&repnum=19646&frequency=A&icode=&oporder=2) and growing robustly, this sector is the true engine of India’s global economic ascent. Crucially, these exports – which include IT services, financial services, business-process outsourcing, and research and development – are not subject to tariffs. As an added benefit, the policy uncertainty created by Trump’s tariff war could accelerate multinational firms’ diversification of operations away from America. India is well-positioned to capitalize on this shift, and I know from my own experience that Indian exporters of both goods and services have already begun to intensify their efforts to develop business links in OECD markets other than the US. But beyond trade economics, Trump’s tariffs raise a larger question: What is India’s place in the world? Two competing visions have long animated domestic debate on this issue. One vision presents the country as outward-looking and confident, pursuing growth by embracing globalization and leveraging Western technology, finance, and markets. To realize its potential, India must embrace deeper integration into the world economy. ## Black Friday Sale: Unlimited insight. A limited-time offer.

SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE This vision reflects the closer ties that India has forged with the West in recent decades – and which underpinned its economic success between 1991 and 2011. The Indian diaspora has grown in size and prominence throughout the Western world, while India itself has come to rely on Western technology and business networks. For all the talk of enhancing economic links with Russia or China, good luck finding an elite family in India whose kids are studying in either country. The opposing view portrays international engagement not as an opportunity for India, but as a source of vulnerability. This defensive posture is shaped by skepticism toward the West – a holdover from the colonial period – and a belief in self-reliance to the point of autarky, often at the expense of efficiency and growth. Trump’s new tariffs have provided ammunition to the proponents of this more insular vision by bolstering the narrative that the global system is unreliable, and that engagement with the West is ultimately harmful to India’s interests and security. To the extent that these arguments find purchase among India’s leaders, the country risks embracing protectionism and nativism. Such a shift would be detrimental to India’s long-term prosperity, Asian security, and what remains of the liberal world order. Fortunately, there are signs that the outward-looking view remains dominant. The free-trade agreement that India just signed with the United Kingdom commits it to reducing protectionist barriers. It also illustrates India’s willingness to pursue deeper economic links with OECD countries when they are based on mutual interest and respect. One can only hope that ongoing negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement with the European Union will follow a similar trajectory, further anchoring India to the principles of economic openness. America’s tariff attack has created an opportunity for India to clarify its strategic priorities. The country’s optimal response to US protectionism is not to retaliate or retreat, but to seek and cultivate other partners that remain committed to rules-based international trade. By deepening trade and investment ties with the UK, the EU, Japan, and Australia, India can recalibrate its economic relationships and reaffirm its commitment to the globalized economy that has served it so well. ## Featured 1. ## How COP30 Can Re-Energize Climate Action Nov 11, 2025 [Jennifer Morgan](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/jennifer-morgan) 2. ## Trumponomics Will End in Tears Nov 12, 2025 [Desmond Lachman](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/desmond-lachman) 3. ## Free Trade Can’t Bring Peace Nov 14, 2025 [Benn Steil](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/benn-steil) 4. ## Trump’s Dangerous Liaison With Pakistan Nov 14, 2025 [Brahma Chellaney](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/brahma-chellaney) 5. ## The Stablecoin Threat Nov 17, 2025 [Angus Armstrong](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/angus-armstrong) & [Dennis J.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

Organizations like the VHP are on the upswing as Hindu nationalism grows in India. (NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

(PRABIN RANABHAT/AFP via Getty Images) The growing momentum of youth-led and anti-elite movements across South Asia signals that political transitions in the region are far from settled. As traditional power structures weaken, new political actors are emerging. Governments will likely face increasing pressure to demonstrate democratic accountability and deliver economic gains despite fiscal constraints, heightening the risk of policy volatility and unevenly distributed benefits. Over the longer term, these shifts could reshape the region's political order, encouraging greater popular participation and institutional reform while straining governments' capacity to maintain cohesion and deliver consistent policy outcomes.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "full_text": "Bangladesh will likely adopt a more assertive foreign policy, which will likely include strengthening ties with Pakistan while balancing its economic dependencies on India and maintaining cooperation on security and regional stability. On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies.

The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen from politically sensitive targets, and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents from the Offices of the Dalai Lama, and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing sensitive information on citizens of numerous third party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business information, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while operating core servers located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and motivation of the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some of the associations of the attackers through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an eight month, collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and SecDev) and the Shadowserver Foundation. The investigation employed a fusion methodology, combining technical interrogation techniques, data analysis, and field research, to track and uncover the Shadow cyber espionage network.

    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Trump. With his administration’s fervent embrace of economic nationalism and an \"America First\" doctrine, Trump disrupted long-standing trade norms, sparking a wave of tariff wars that has reverberated through every corner of the global economy. Though much of the media focus is rightly placed on the bruising economic standoff between the United States and China, India Asia’s third-largest economy is not immune to the aftershocks. The U.S.-China trade war creates opportunities for India in certain supply chains, but it also exposes vulnerabilities, particularly as the Trump administration turned its gaze toward India’s growing trade surplus with the U.S. The imposition of significant tariffs on Indian exports, culminating in a sweeping 26% blanket tariff across multiple sectors in 2025, raises fundamental questions about India's role in global trade. Is India prepared to step into the breach as a neutral manufacturing alternative to China? Could it shield its vulnerable sectors while still leveraging its demographic and production strengths? And, perhaps most critically, how would this barrage of tariffs shape the trajectory of India’s economic growth, labor markets, and diplomatic positioning? This blog explores in depth the multifaceted impact of Trump-era tariffs and the broader U.S.-China trade war on the Indian economy and the global economy at large. It moves sector by sector examining information technology, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, agriculture, electronics, and automobile components while also considering the macroeconomic and geopolitical consequences. What emerges is a complex, at times contradictory, narrative: one of challenges and constraints but also of adaptation and opportunity. The last portion of blog goes on to discuss the Chinese retaliation to American trade tariffs and how India, Russia and the world could navigate these choppy waters of trade wars. ### **Trump’s Tariff Policies and Global Trade Disruption** Donald Trump's approach to international trade marks a significant departure from the multilateralism that had defined U.S. economic policy since World War II. In its place emerged a unilateral, punitive model rooted in protectionism. Central to this strategy are tariffs, imposed under various legal pretexts ranging from national security to the invocation of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. These actions targeted not only China, with which the U.S. had the most visible confrontation, but also long-standing allies and trade partners, including the European Union, Canada, Mexico, and notably, India. India finds itself on Trump’s radar for two main reasons. First, the U.S. consistently ran a trade deficit with India, which reached nearly $24 billion at its peak in 2018. Second, Washington increasingly viewed India’s protectionist policies including high tariffs on American goods and complex regulatory barriers as incompatible with fair trade practices. In retaliation, the Trump administration revoked India’s preferential trade status under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) in 2019, stripping benefits from over $5.6 billion worth of Indian exports. This revocation was followed by a series of tariff escalations. In response, India imposed retaliatory tariffs on 28 U.S. products, including almonds, apples, and walnuts. While the tit-for-tat measures remained relatively contained through the end of Trump’s first term, the return of Trump-era trade policies in the form of a renewed push in 2025 to reestablish tariff barriers saw a more aggressive posture. A sweeping 26% tariff on a range of Indian imports has been levied, justified on grounds of \"reciprocity\" and the perceived need to counterbalance India's own trade barriers. Though the direct numerical impact of these tariffs varied by sector, the cumulative psychological and financial blow is profound. Indian exporters, already grappling with a complex global trade environment post-COVID and amid increasing competition from Southeast Asian economies, are now being forced to reconsider their market strategies. Some are seeking to pivot toward Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, while others have doubled down on compliance and lobbying in Washington, hoping for sectoral exemptions. But across the board, there is a recognition that India’s days of quasi-free access to the U.S. market were over. This dramatic shift in policy direction, combined with the concurrent U.S.-China standoff, creates a new matrix of challenges and opportunities for India. On the one hand, companies sought to \"de-risk\" their supply chains by moving out of China, and India appeared as an attractive alternative. On the other hand, the aggressive U.S. posture toward multiple trading partners complicated efforts to present India as a stable and reliable destination for global manufacturing. The rest of this blog will explore how this turbulent geopolitical trade environment might unfold on the ground in India sector by sector, policy by policy and how Indian industry, government, could respond to a rapidly changing global economic order. ### **Information Technology Services: Indirect Exposure and Demand Slowdown** India’s information technology (IT) services sector has long stood as a pillar of the nation’s export economy. With marquee companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, and HCL Technologies delivering software development, business process outsourcing (BPO), and consulting services across global markets particularly the United States the sector has become a symbol of India’s integration into the global knowledge economy. In 2023, over 60% of Indian IT services exports were directed to North America, making the region not just a growth engine but a lifeline. Despite the 2025 Trump-era tariffs are not directly targeting IT services which are often intangible and not subject to customs duties the sector found itself indirectly caught in the economic crossfire. The broader uncertainty and potential economic slowdown triggered by protectionist trade measures in the U.S. has a chilling effect on discretionary IT spending. Key client industries in the U.S. particularly manufacturing, retail, automotive, and financial services have begun tightening budgets in anticipation of slower growth and greater regulatory volatility. This belt-tightening will have a direct impact on Indian IT firms. Deal cycles will lengthen; contract values might shrink with renewals slowing as American companies reassess their digital transformation roadmaps. Even though the need for cloud migration, cybersecurity, and AI integration remains strong, many clients would hesitate to commit to long-term engagements. Indian IT companies, highly sensitive to these ebbs and flows, will be forced to adjust revenue guidance downward. Adding to the complexity is the resurgence of debate within U.S. political circles about outsourcing and job offshoring. Under the broader nationalist economic agenda, the Trump-aligned rhetoric has once again questioned the logic of American companies depending on foreign IT service providers for core operational functions. Though these debates did not immediately result in legislation, they create a reputational risk for Indian firms and prompt some U.S.-based clients to consider “onshoring” a portion of their operations. This, in turn, could place pressure on Indian companies to expand their footprint in the U.S. by hiring locally or acquiring American firms moves that typically come with higher costs. Yet, amid the challenges, some silver linings emerge. The same de-risking logic that pushed American companies to diversify away from Chinese hardware providers extended albeit subtly to software and digital services. Indian firms that have invested early in building local delivery centers in the U.S. can find themselves better positioned to win government contracts and industry-specific deals, particularly in healthcare and federal services. The evolving cybersecurity landscape, shaped by growing concerns over Chinese technology espionage, can also help Indian companies portray themselves as neutral, reliable partners. Nevertheless, the net impact of the trade war and tariff environment is a slowdown in India’s IT growth trajectory. Hiring is likely to be curtailed across major firms, with campus placements reduced in volume and deferred in schedule. The IT sector may continue to underperform broader markets during the period, reflecting investor skepticism about near-term margins and growth. Startups in the SaaS space, particularly those dependent on U.S. small- and medium-sized business clients, are also experiencing funding constraints as venture capital became wary of exposure to geopolitical risk. In summary, while not a direct casualty of the Trump-era tariffs, India’s IT services sector is nonetheless ensnared in the ripple effects of a decelerating and increasingly protectionist U.S. economy. The looming recession in American economy & the adoption of Artificial Intelligence is further likely to hit deal wins and profit margins of Indian IT firms as discretionary spends will slow down. The sector’s resilience and adaptability so far has helped mitigate the worst of the damage, but its overreliance on the North American market is once again laid bare. The episode serves as both a warning and a catalyst for diversification geographically, sectorally, and technologically. ### **Pharmaceuticals: The Resilient Outlier in the Storm** Among all the sectors caught in the web of shifting trade policies and tariff battles, India’s pharmaceutical industry has emerged as a rare beacon of resilience and in some ways, strategic indispensability. As one of the world’s largest suppliers of generic drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), India has long been referred to as the \"pharmacy of the developing world.\" But more crucially, it is also a major supplier of affordable medicines to the United States. With over $9 billion in annual pharmaceutical exports to the U.S., India’s role in sustaining the American healthcare system is profound, and arguably irreplaceable in the short-to-medium term. This strategic relevance proved vital when the Trump administration, despite its sweeping tariff agenda in 2025, consciously chose to exempt pharmaceutical imports from India. The rationale behind this exemption was as much about domestic U.S. politics as it was about public health. Rising healthcare costs had become a flashpoint in American domestic discourse, and the availability of low-cost generics was viewed as essential to controlling insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses for millions of Americans. In a nation where prescription drug prices often rank among the highest in the world, the supply of cost-effective Indian medicines played a crucial stabilizing role. This exemption came as a relief to Indian pharmaceutical giants which rely heavily on the U.S. market for both revenue and regulatory prestige. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) remains the gold standard for drug approvals globally, and success in the U.S. market often unlocks access to other lucrative territories. Maintaining uninterrupted trade relations with the U.S. ensures that Indian firms could continue with their product launches, including complex generics and biosimilars, even amid a fractious global trade atmosphere. However, the pharmaceutical sector is not entirely insulated from broader headwinds. Increased scrutiny from the FDA over manufacturing practices, ongoing concerns about data integrity, and periodic import bans on specific production units continued to cast a shadow. Moreover, while the sector is so far spared from tariffs, it faced indirect pressure from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, rising raw material costs especially APIs sourced from China and logistical disruptions due to global shipping uncertainties. An interesting twist during the tariff escalation is the quiet encouragement within the U.S. policy community to \"onshore\" some critical medicine production capabilities. Although this movement was primarily directed at reducing dependency on China, it also raised questions about over-reliance on India for certain life-saving drugs. Consequently, some Indian pharmaceutical firms have begun exploring joint ventures and acquisitions in the United States to build a more embedded presence in the American pharmaceutical ecosystem. These ventures served both as hedges against potential future protectionism and as a way to reduce political risk exposure. The pandemic experience also has a lingering effect on how pharmaceutical supply chains are viewed. Having played a central role in global COVID-19 vaccine production and distribution, Indian pharmaceutical companies enjoyed a degree of diplomatic goodwill that proved useful during this trade conflict. Indian vaccine diplomacy, combined with active participation in global health initiatives, helped bolster the sector's reputation as a force for global good rather than just another profit-seeking exporter. Domestically, the sector saw increased investment and policy support from the Indian government under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which aimed to make India more self-reliant in API manufacturing and high-end formulations. These efforts aligned with a larger vision of building resilience in critical sectors and reducing strategic dependencies. In totality, the pharmaceutical industry stands out as a resilient outlier in a period marked by volatility and protectionism. While other export-oriented sectors scramble to adapt to new tariff realities, pharma remained steady, shielded by its strategic value and deep entrenchment in global healthcare networks. Yet, even this seeming immunity came with a quiet warning: India’s strength in pharmaceuticals must be underpinned by constant vigilance in quality control, supply chain robustness, and strategic global outreach. The sector's ability to remain tariff-exempt may not be permanent as President Trump has already threatened to impose Pharma tariffs in coming days which could substantially hit Indian generic pharma manufacturers however innovator & contract manufacturing like CDMO pharma having base in US & Europe may not be that impacted as API supply chains might diversify to India from China. ### **Gems and Jewellery: A Sector Under Siege** In stark contrast to the pharmaceutical industry’s relative immunity, India’s gems and jewellery sector finds itself squarely in the crosshairs of the Trump-era tariff escalation. Long a crown jewel of India’s export economy, this sector has deep cultural, economic, and employment linkages across the country. From the diamond polishing workshops of Surat to the goldsmith clusters in Tamil Nadu and the jewellery design hubs of Mumbai, the industry employs over five million people, directly and indirectly. The United States, meanwhile, stands as its largest export destination, accounting for nearly 40% of the sector’s international sales. The imposition of a steep 26% tariff up from effectively zero in many cases on jewellery and polished stones in 2025 is a body blow. Unlike pharmaceuticals, where strategic considerations could override commercial logic, the gems and jewellery sector offered no such buffer. To the Trump administration, luxury goods like diamonds, gold jewellery, and precious ornaments are fair game symbols of elite consumption, low in political cost and high in symbolic value when framed as a defense of American industry and artisanship. This could result in dramatic contraction in Indian exports to the U.S. almost overnight as the tariffs go in effect on 9th April 2025. For Indian exporters, the implications are immediate and far-reaching. Existing contracts could be renegotiated or even cancelled. Retailers in the U.S., facing significantly higher landing costs may turn to domestic suppliers or explore alternative markets in Thailand and Turkey. Indian exporters, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) without the financial cushion or global footprint to absorb such shocks, will be forced to furlough workers, delay shipments, and slash production. The city of Surat, which processes nine out of every ten diamonds sold globally, could possibly report a huge drop in orders within the first quarter following the tariff hike. Beyond the sheer scale of financial loss, the emotional and psychological toll on the industry could be profound. For decades, India has cultivated a reputation for excellence, affordability, and reliability in the global gemstone trade. That credibility takes a hit not because of a lapse in quality or service, but due to geopolitical crossfire. Many industry stakeholders feel blindsided, arguing that the U.S. failed to appreciate the interdependencies at play. After all, the gems and jewellery trade wasn’t just about finished products. It was about deep supply chains, craftsmanship, and a legacy of bilateral economic engagement that transcended borders. Efforts by the Indian government to lobby for a reduction in tariffs through backchannel diplomacy and formal trade talks so far have yielded little success in the short term though a Bilateral Trade Agreement could be made in medium term. While conversations have continued under the auspices of broader U.S.-India trade negotiations, the Trump administration remained adamant while going ahead on reciprocal tariffs without significant reciprocal concessions something New Delhi was unwilling to provide amid domestic political sensitivities around gold import duties and the broader current account balance. To adapt, Indian exporters should look to diversify their markets. Efforts must be intensified to increase sales to the UAE, Hong Kong, and the EU. The India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), which offered duty-free access for certain jewellery products, could become a vital fallback. Digital platforms can also be embraced more aggressively, with some jewellers launching direct-to-consumer channels targeting the Indian diaspora and other non-U.S. audiences. But the damage in the U.S. market remains undeniable. Major brands that once sourced heavily from India should start exploring alternative supply chains to hedge against geopolitical risk. Even within India, investment in the sector can slow down, as uncertainty over export prospects made financing harder to obtain and discouraged risk-taking. In policy circles, the tariff crisis renewed debates over the need for long-term structural reforms in the gems and jewellery sector. India must go for further value addition with stricter traceability standards to meet international norms, and more robust branding of Indian-made jewellery in global markets. Some even suggest exploring vertical integration models, akin to what De Beers and Tiffany have championed, to insulate against such shocks in the future. Ultimately, the Trump-era tariffs serve as a brutal reminder of the vulnerability of non-strategic, high-value export sectors to sudden geopolitical shifts. For India’s gems and jewellery industry, the path forward lay in adaptation but also in hard-nosed diplomacy, market diversification, and a fundamental rethinking of the sector’s dependence on any single nation, no matter how lucrative. ### **Agriculture: Mixed Fortunes and Strategic Positioning** Agriculture has always occupied a uniquely sensitive space in India’s economic and political landscape. It remains the primary source of livelihood for nearly half the population and contributes significantly to export revenues through commodities like rice, tea, spices, seafood, and cotton. As the U.S. ramps up its tariff wars, global agricultural trade flows can be disrupted, creating a patchwork of risks and opportunities for India. While the sector is not directly hit by the 2025 Trump tariffs to the extent of others many key agricultural exports remained exempt the ripple effects are nonetheless complex and multifaceted. India is one of the largest exporters of Sea Food and Basmati Rice to USA with states like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat playing a critical role in seafood exports. The U.S. remains one of the largest importers of Indian shrimp, and demand has held up steady despite rising prices and logistical challenges. Similarly, India’s dominance in the basmati rice market remains unchallenged due to strong diaspora demand and the high entry barriers for competing products. But even as specific commodities dodged tariff penalties, broader trade friction can lead to increase inspections, slower port clearances, and tightening of quality and phytosanitary regulations at the U.S. border. These procedural bottlenecks, although not officially part of any tariff schedule, introduce new non-tariff barriers that effectively increase the cost and complexity of doing business. Smaller exporters, lacking compliance infrastructure, may struggle disproportionately. At the same time, India finds itself presented with strategic opportunities, particularly in light of the U.S.-China trade decoupling. As the Trump administration sharply curtails agricultural imports from China most notably soybeans, garlic, and certain processed foods zU.S. importers could explore alternative sourcing markets. India, with its vast agricultural diversity and relatively low production costs, can emerge as a potential replacement. Though it can’t fill China’s massive export shoes overnight, Indian suppliers of niche agricultural goods can see a spike in inquiries from U.S. distributors looking to diversify their procurement sources. However, seizing these opportunities wasn’t always straightforward. Structural issues within Indian agriculture like fragmented land holdings, inconsistent supply chains, inadequate cold storage, and fluctuating quality standards posed barriers to rapid scale-up. Moreover, price volatility, driven by weak monsoons and input cost inflation, make Indian commodities less predictable from the perspective of foreign buyers. These challenges underscore the need for deeper reform, investment, and modernization in the sector, if India were to meaningfully capitalize on its comparative advantages. Meanwhile, domestic political sensitivities added another layer of complexity. In the aftermath of the farmers’ protests that had swept the country in previous years, the Indian government is very cautious about appearing to prioritize exports over local food security. This has tempered its willingness to enter into concessions with the United States that could benefit exporters but risk domestic backlash especially on politically sensitive items like dairy and wheat and the issues of Farmer subsidies, MSP. Nevertheless, India should use this opportunity to bring the much need agricultural reforms like fostering new public-private partnerships to develop farmer-producer organizations (FPOs) capable of engaging directly with foreign buyers, bypassing layers of middlemen and improving both income distribution and traceability. India should also look to setting up cold storage supply chains and improve logistical bottlenecks for Indian Agro products to be exported globally. This can be a part of a broader vision to integrate Indian agriculture more closely with global value chains while still retaining a core commitment to food sovereignty and rural employment. ### **Electronics and Hardware: Between the Tariff Fire and the China Factor** India's electronics and hardware sector finds itself in a curious position amid the intensifying U.S.-China trade war and the subsequent imposition of tariffs on Indian imports. On one hand, this is a sector that stood to gain significantly from the U.S. desire to \"decouple\" from Chinese electronics and semiconductors. On the other, the sudden imposition of a sweeping 26% tariff on Indian electronic goods in April 2025 has threatened to derail much of the progress made in recent years. For a country still in the nascent stages of developing a globally competitive electronics export industry, the situation demands a swift and strategic recalibration. To understand the stakes, one must appreciate the evolution of India’s electronics sector. For decades, India was viewed primarily as a consumer, rather than a manufacturer, of electronic products. However, under the “Make in India” initiative and, more recently, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, significant efforts have been made to transform the country into a manufacturing hub. Large players like Foxconn, Pegatron, and Samsung have set up assembly units for smartphones, consumer electronics, and semiconductor packaging, particularly in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. These developments led to a sharp rise in India’s electronics exports from under $10 billion in the early 2010s to over $23 billion by 2024. The U.S. had emerged as a key export market, especially for consumer electronics, chargers, LED products, and IT hardware components. The hope was that India could step into the vacuum left by Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE, which faced intense scrutiny and sanctions in the U.S. on national security grounds. However, the Trump administration’s broad-brush approach to tariffs has disrupted this strategic alignment. The 26% tariff imposed on a wide swath of Indian electronics products even as Chinese products were subjected to even higher duties throw a wrench into the equation. While India retains a relative cost advantage over China, the new tariff regime has dulled its competitive edge. American importers now have to choose between paying high tariffs on Chinese goods or slightly less onerous ones on Indian products. For many, the calculus doesn’t justify a rapid supply chain overhaul. Instead of aggressively shifting to India, several U.S. companies may adopt a wait-and-watch approach, or divert some of their sourcing to other low tariff zone like Australia, New Zealand, UK, Brazil, Argentina, Saudi Arabia or even UAE, which enjoy more favourable trade terms with USA. Indian electronic manufacturing industry has already sounded alarm of losing out business to low tariffs zones compared to India. Within India, the response is cautious and mixed. Larger firms with global exposure could explore the option of expanding manufacturing footprints in countries with preferential trade access to the U.S., such as Latin America or Europe. This \"geo-sourcing\" strategy could allow them to skirt around tariff walls while maintaining their supply chain linkages with India. Smaller manufacturers, however, will be left scrambling with lack of capital, logistical muscle to pivot internationally forcing them to cut production, lay off workers, or shift focus to the domestic markets. The broader policy response from New Delhi can be twofold. First, a renewed push for trade diplomacy aimed at carving out sectoral exemptions or negotiating a digital and electronics-specific agreement under the broader U.S.-India trade dialogue. Indian officials can emphasize that penalizing Indian electronics is counterproductive to U.S. goals of building a trusted and democratic global supply chain. While these arguments may resonate with certain quarters in Washington, they could fail to produce immediate policy relief forcing international suppliers to pivot to another low tariff jurisdiction. Second, the Indian government can double down on domestic reforms like giving additional incentives can be offered to companies investing in component manufacturing, not just final assembly. Semiconductor policy should be given a major push, with subsidies for fab plants and chip design firms. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) should be repurposed to serve as electronics export hubs, and customs procedures be streamlined to reduce turnaround times for high-value shipments. These moves can offer a long-term vision to build electronics manufacturing depth that could weather future geopolitical turbulence. Despite the tariff’s setbacks, India’s strategic position in global electronics should continue to improve albeit incrementally. Some American and European firms, wary of deep exposure to China, may begin limited sourcing from Indian partners. Indian contract manufacturers could also start moving up the value chain, offering design, prototyping, and embedded systems integration areas where price sensitivity is lower and expertise matters more. In the high-margin segments like medical devices and aerospace electronics, Indian industry can carve out a niche. Nevertheless, the tariff-induced shock has made one thing abundantly clear: India’s electronics sector is extremely too vulnerable to policy swings in major markets, especially the United States. It lacks both the scale and insulation to thrive in a protectionist environment without significant diplomatic support. For policymakers and industry leaders alike, this is a moment of reckoning an inflection point that underscores the need for strategic self-sufficiency, diversified markets, and robust global partnerships built not merely on price competitiveness but on trust, technology, and long-term value. ### **Automobile Components: Collateral Damage and Strategic Rethinking** India's automobile components industry, though less flashy than its IT or pharmaceutical counterparts, has quietly emerged as a key pillar of the country's export landscape. With over $19 billion in exports as of 2024, the sector supplies a diverse array of parts to global auto giants, including Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, and Toyota. The United States, as one of the largest automotive markets in the world, accounts for a significant share of these exports particularly in engine components, braking systems, transmission parts, and electrical assemblies. The 2025 imposition of a 25% tariff on Indian auto parts by the Trump administration struck the industry at a vulnerable moment. Just as it was beginning to recover from pandemic-era supply chain shocks and semiconductor shortages, the renewed wave of protectionism threatens to undercut its competitiveness in the North American market. While India is not the primary target Trump’s policy is broadly aimed at reshoring U.S. auto manufacturing and countering China’s dominance, however the collateral damage to Indian suppliers is undeniable. For Indian manufacturers, the tariff effectively raises the landing cost of their products, narrowing the price gap that had made them attractive to American auto assemblers in the first place. As a result, many U.S.-based companies can reevaluate their supplier portfolios. Some can look toward Mexico, benefiting from the USMCA (United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement), while others may consider closer-to-home sourcing options despite higher base prices. The volume of purchase orders from Indian firms could dip, slowing down long-term contract negotiations considerably. Largely, globally integrated Indian firms are better equipped to weather the storm. Many of them already have production facilities in the U.S. or Europe, allowing them to shift some manufacturing offshore to bypass the tariff wall. But smaller firms, which make up the backbone of India’s auto components ecosystem, lack this flexibility. For them, the tariff meant margin erosion, declining order books, and an urgent need to refocus on other markets or scale down exports altogether. This sudden realignment has forced a broader introspection within the industry. The dependence on a single large export market like the U.S. had always been a strategic risk, but the tariff war turned it into an operational crisis. Many firms can look to investing in the ASEAN region, trying to tap into the emerging electric vehicle (EV) supply chains in Southeast Asia. Others can turn toward Europe, where regulatory demands were higher but tariff environments more stable. Domestic demand, bolstered by India's own automotive growth, provided a partial cushion but could not fully compensate for lost U.S. business. In response, the Indian government can offer modest support measures like export credit guarantees be extended, and schemes under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative to be expanded to include more auto component clusters. However, these could be temporary fixes and what is needed, is a long-term vision to boost high-tech manufacturing, reduce reliance on basic components exports, and transition into Tier 1 and Tier 2 supplier roles in global EV and autonomous vehicle ecosystems. To this end, several industry leaders should explore strategic partnerships with global automotive technology firms. The focus should shift from just volume-driven exports to value-added components like battery management systems, EV inverters, and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). R&D budgets should be reallocated toward innovation, and joint ventures need to be proposed to develop proprietary technologies rather than simply serve as low-cost suppliers. The broader aim should be to make Indian firms indispensable within global value chains less replaceable, and more aligned with the future of mobility. In the final analysis, the automobile components sector can bear the brunt of being peripheral to the strategic calculations of both Washington and New Delhi. It lacks the national security implications of pharmaceuticals or the geo-digital relevance of IT. Yet it is foundational to jobs, regional development, and industrial modernization in India. The Trump-era tariffs may have weakened its U.S.-bound prospects temporarily, but they also catalyzed a strategic rethink, a pivot from volume to value, and from dependence to diversification. Whether that transformation can be sustained will depend on how quickly the industry can adapt to an automotive future that is increasingly electric, connected, and protectionist. ### **Trump Tariffs knitting Indian Textile Sector** The recent imposition of retaliatory tariffs by the United States, specifically a 26% levy on Indian imports, is creating ripples across India's textile sector. While on the surface this might appear punitive, a deeper look reveals that India is relatively better positioned compared to its regional competitors. China now faces a 54% tariff on textile exports to the U.S., Bangladesh 37%, and Vietnam a steep 46%. This disparity offers Indian exporters a significant pricing advantage in the American market, especially for mid-range and mass-market apparel categories where cost competitiveness is crucial. For Indian textile manufacturers and exporters, this development presents a timely opportunity to capture greater market share in the United States. U.S. buyers, faced with shrinking margins due to increased input costs, are actively looking to shift sourcing away from China and other higher-tariff countries. Indian firms, particularly those in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, are reporting a surge in inquiries and new contracts. The sector, already benefiting from the China+1 strategy and diversification in global supply chains, now has an additional tailwind to boost exports, particularly in segments like cotton garments, home textiles, and woven fabrics. However, challenges remain. Despite the tariff advantage, India’s textile sector grapples with structural inefficiencies such as outdated machinery, high power tariffs, and labour laws that limit flexibility. Additionally, competition from duty-free countries like those under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), though reduced in scope, still exists. Indian exporters must also contend with non-tariff barriers such as quality certifications, sustainability mandates, and tighter scrutiny on labour practices all of which are becoming standard expectations from U.S. and European buyers. To fully capitalize on this geopolitical and trade shift, the Indian government must enact supportive policies that enhance production efficiency and global competitiveness. Expanding textile parks, simplifying compliance under labour codes, and offering targeted subsidies or incentives for green manufacturing can help Indian exporters convert this short-term advantage into long-term dominance. Furthermore, by improving container logistics and port infrastructure, India can reduce lead times and better compete with East Asian peers. If leveraged wisely, the current tariff landscape could be a transformative moment for India’s textile industry. Further if countries like Vietnam engage in diplomacy and opt for zero tariff trade pacts with USA it could lead to that opportunity dwindling away for the textile sector. ### **Macroeconomic Implications: Growth, Inflation, and Policy Dilemmas** The cumulative effect of Trump-era tariffs on India’s macroeconomic landscape extends well beyond individual sectors. Though the trade tensions are primarily cast as bilateral skirmishes between governments and industries, their true reverberations are felt at the national level in GDP projections, inflation rates, investor sentiment, and policy maneuverability. The U.S. decision to impose a flat 26% tariff on a broad spectrum of Indian exports comes at a particularly fragile moment for the Indian economy, which was already navigating a complex terrain of post-pandemic recovery, global supply chain realignments, and rising energy costs amid a slowdown and a liquidity crunch overall in the economy. Early estimates from financial institutions and think tanks suggested that the tariffs could shave off anywhere between 20 to 40 basis points from India’s GDP growth in the 2025–26 fiscal year. Though this figure may seem modest on the surface, the real pain lay in its concentration, certain export-heavy states, districts, and employment clusters would bear the brunt of the impact. Exporters might face rising inventories, tighter cash flows, and delayed payments from international buyers who are themselves are grappling with the uncertainty of a volatile tariff regime. These microeconomic stresses can quickly feed into the broader economic narrative, dampening the optimism that had been building around India's potential to serve as a \"China plus one\" manufacturing alternative. At the same time, inflationary pressures can compound the problem. The disruption of trade flows introduces new frictions into global supply chains, leading to increased import costs for intermediate goods and raw materials many of which are essential to Indian manufacturing. From semiconductor chips used in electronics and automotive production to critical chemicals needed in pharmaceuticals and textiles, the price volatility of imported inputs squeezed profit margins and contribute to consumer price inflation. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which had been signalling a neutral stand could be forced to drastically cut rates and inject liquidity into the market in a delicate balancing act needing to support growth without allowing inflation to spiral. Meanwhile, the Indian rupee can come under pressure as export earnings dips and foreign institutional investors (FIIs) adopt a risk-off approach. Uncertainty surrounding future U.S.-India trade relations can led to a short-term flight of capital, particularly from mid-cap manufacturing and tech stocks that had big US exposure. The rupee’s depreciation, while offering some buffer to exporters by improving price competitiveness, also raise the cost of oil imports and external debt servicing two perennial vulnerabilities in the Indian macroeconomic mix. The government’s response reflects both urgency and caution. On one hand, New Delhi accelerated its bilateral trade diplomacy with Washington, hoping to secure sectoral carve-outs and negotiate Bi-lateral trade agreement. On the other hand, it can initiate internal policy discussions about increasing export subsidies, expanding Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, and enhancing export credit lines to cushion industries most affected by the tariff shock. However, such fiscal measures are constrained by competing budgetary pressures, including rising social sector spending and infrastructure commitments. Complicating matters further is the international optics of India's position. While it is seeking exemptions and relief from the U.S., it also has to maintain its image as a leader of the Global South, often vocal about trade equity and multilateralism. India cannot afford to appear overly compliant with American economic nationalism, lest it alienates other key partners like the European Union, ASEAN, and African nations. Balancing this diplomatic tightrope required deft maneuvering presenting itself as both a victim of unfair trade measures and a willing partner in restoring global supply chain stability. The abruptness and scale of the Trump tariffs has reawakened fears about India’s external vulnerabilities, particularly its dependence on a small number of export markets. It has reignited debates among economists, business leaders, and policymakers about the need to diversify trade relationships, boost domestic consumption, and reduce overexposure to the vicissitudes of Western politics. For all the talk of resilience, the Indian economy has once again been reminded of its susceptibility to external shocks especially those driven by populist agendas half a world away. That said, the episode is not without its silver linings. The jolt provided by the tariffs should force a re-examination of structural bottlenecks, leading to renewed urgency around trade diversification, and even prompting long-overdue upgrades in customs, compliance, and logistics infrastructure. It can also inject new life into India’s outreach to Africa and Latin America regions that, while underdeveloped in trade terms, offer the promise of growth untethered from great power rivalries. In the final tally, the Trump-era tariffs are a disruptive force, not a destructive one. They may slow growth, trigger inflationary pressures, and strained policy bandwidth, but they cannot break the Indian economy’s trajectory. Rather they can accelerate its reckoning with the global trade order and perhaps, nudge it toward a more resilient, diversified, and self-aware economic future. ### **Strategic Realignment and Trade Diplomacy: India's Response on the Global Stage** As the Trump-era tariff shock reverberates across sectors and seeped into the core of India’s macroeconomic structure, the need for a strategic recalibration of India’s external economic engagement becomes unmistakable. In the years following the first wave of U.S. tariffs during Trump’s earlier tenure, India had slowly been shifting its trade posture from passive resilience to proactive engagement. The 2025 blanket tariff escalation can catalyze this process into a full-fledged diplomatic sprint, forcing India to reassess not just its relationship with the United States, but also its positioning within the broader architecture of global trade and alliances. The initial Indian response to the tariff escalation is one of cautious pragmatism. Recognizing that aggressive retaliation could escalate the situation and derail other avenues of strategic cooperation with the U.S. particularly in defense, technology, and the Indo-Pacific security framework New Delhi has opted for a diplomatic route. Top officials from the Ministry of Commerce have been quickly dispatched to Washington for backchannel negotiations, while formal trade dialogue has resumed between two countries seeking an early resolute to trade tariffs disputes. India's core ask should be: sectoral exemptions like Agriculture, Foodstuffs & Pharma while negotiating a broader Bi-Lateral Trade Agreement with USA. Trump administration, emboldened by its ideological commitment to \"reciprocity,\" remains insistent on more structural changes asking greater market access for American dairy, farm products, and medical devices, as well as stronger enforcement mechanisms for intellectual property rights. For India, these demands are politically sensitive, and while some flexibility may be offered behind closed doors, the broader contours of the disagreement remain on these issues. The impasse illustrates a deeper truth: U.S.-India trade tensions are no longer episodic irritants but symptomatic of deeper structural mismatches between two large, divergent economies navigating their paths through a shifting global order. In response, India should undertake a broader strategic realignment. Recognizing the risks of overexposure to any single market be it the U.S. or China, New Delhi should make efforts to diversify its trade partnerships. This includes finalizing and operationalizing free trade agreements (FTAs) with the UAE and Australia, fast-tracking negotiations with the European Union and the UK, and reopening stalled discussions with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and MERCOSUR nations. Each of these moves should reflect a clear policy objective: reduce vulnerability by expanding opportunity. Moreover, India should deepen its engagement with multilateral and regional trade institutions. Although it had walked away from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2020 over fears of Chinese economic dominance, India could explore revisiting its role in alternative trade blocs and frameworks. It should look with renewed interest in joining the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), albeit selectively, and ramp up its activity within the BRICS and SCO economic platforms. These moves are not about replacing the West with the East, but about hedging risks in a multi-polar world where no single alignment offers complete security. India could also begin playing a more assertive role in setting the narrative around global trade equity. Drawing on its leadership in the Global South, it should push for reforms in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to ensure that developing countries were not disproportionately hurt by tariff wars launched by larger economies. Indian diplomats should advocate for stronger dispute resolution mechanisms and greater protection for emerging markets, framing the Trump-era tariffs not just as a bilateral dispute but as a cautionary tale for the global trading system. At the same time, India can seek to bolster domestic resilience. The idea is not to turn inward, but to prepare for a world in which trade could no longer be relied upon as an uninterrupted engine of growth. This includes greater investment in logistics infrastructure, the expansion of digital customs systems, and the implementation of trade facilitation measures aimed at reducing non-tariff barriers. The government can also begin incentivizing companies to enter new geographies offering tax breaks and marketing support for exporters targeting Latin America, Africa, and Central Asia. In essence, the Trump tariffs can be a force of good for India to shed its passive trade posture and embrace a more confident, globally aware, and multidirectional strategy. This episode must make policy makers to debates around diversification, resilience, and economic sovereignty, embedding them into the country’s long-term development playbook. And while diplomatic breakthroughs with the U.S. is still some time away, the broader trajectory of India’s trade diplomacy should be shifting from reactive negotiation to active agenda-setting. By turning crisis into opportunity, India can signal that it is no longer willing to be a price-taker in the global economy. That it wants to shape the terms of trade not just accept them. The Trump-era tariffs, harsh as they are, can become the proving ground for this new ambition. ### **China’s retaliation to Trump tariffs & the Big Tech** Globally, China has reacted to US trade tariffs of 54% by retaliating through Tariffs, Blacklists, and Trade Crackdown. China has announced to impose 34% tariff on all U.S. imports starting from April 10, 12:01 PM. Chinese customs have suspended import licenses for six U.S. companies' products. China’s ministry of commerce and customs has decided to impose export controls on rare earth minerals like Samarium, Gadolinum, Terbium, Dysprosium, Lutetium, Scandium and Yttrium. It must be noted here that China controls nearly 67% of world rare earth mineral supply so which are essential for US Department of Defence and Tech industry. As the Wall Street Journal reported, an iPhone 16 Pro (256 GB) tariffs will cost 846 dollars instead of 549 dollars due to tariffs imposed by USA which go in effect on 9th April 2025. This is due to the fact that American tech supply chain retains profitability of low-cost manufacturing in Asia of various components with cheap labour. An iPhone 16 pro for that matter has processor made in Taiwan for 90$, display in South Korea for 37$, battery in China for 4$, storage in Japan for 20$. This extra 296$ due to tariffs on these countries is what the American consumer will end up paying as American technology firms will increase prices to an extent to absorb these tariffs. This will make cost of goods expensive for American consumers adding more inflationary pressure.

He writes in his note **“Trump Tariffs will take US Tech World back a decade… China wins”**. He writes as follows: > _**“We have spoken to hundreds of investors, tech CEOs, supply chain experts around the world this week to gauge the Trump tariff Armageddon unleashed this week.In a nutshell, if these tariffs (in current form/rates) hold there is no debate...it would set the US tech world back a decade in our opinion while China is the clear winner...and we see no debate.**_ > > _**For the first time in 30 years the US is ahead of China when it comes to Al and this 4th Industrial Revolution...being led by Nvidia, Microsoft, OpenAl, Amazon, Alphabet, Palantir, Oracle, Tesla and so many others.....But in one day this tariff policy if enacted will create an upside down supply chain, massive costs, major Cap-Ex delays due to uncertainty, and slow down US tech innovation...not a debate.**_ > > _**Its very easy to say \"build in America\" behind a microphone in the Beltway... the reality is so much different its almost a scary concept. It takes 4-5 years to build a factory in the US, the US labor force and cost structure goes against the entire concept of the modern supply chain, much of the IP and technology fueling the supply chain is cemented in Asia, and the reality this \"near-term pain\" would take a decade to even move the needle.**_ > > _**If US tech companies are faced with this reality, it will negatively change the tech landscape for decades to come. The cost structure of the US tech world would make it impossible to compete with China and this would be a lotto ticket for the China tech landscape: BYD, Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent and thousands of other China tech players to gain more global market share over the years.**_ > > _**This brings us to today... the economic pain that will be brought by these tariffs are hard to describe and can essentially take the US tech industry back a decade in the process while China steamrolls ahead. 50% China tariffs, 32% Taiwan tariffs would essentially cause a shut-off valve from the US tech landscape and in the process cause every electronic to go up 40%-50% for consumers, iPhones made in the US would cost $3,500 (vs. $1,000), and the Al Revolution trade would be significantly slowed down by these head scratching tariffs that NEED to be negotiated to realistic levels. If not its darker days ahead for the tech world.**_ > > _**I have travelled millions of air miles over the decades and seen factories/technology hubs globally....the US has such an unique opportunity to further build its technology, robotics and autonomous infrastructure here...but these reciprocal tariffs (trade deficit converted into some odd calculation) implemented would cause an economic Armageddon and stop the US tech world in its tracks...and wipe out a bright future ahead in one global policy mistake that will reverse US tech dominance in our view. Stocks are getting crushed as investors know math and the reality.”**_ China in retaliation has also included 11 US entities in the list of unreliable entities. China also added 16 U.S. entities to Export Control List. China has launch of an anti-dumping investigation on imported medical CT bulbs originating in the United States and India. While the President Trump is banking on the game theory imposing tariffs and negotiating, the Chinese have retaliated knowing that America is now in a weaker position than it was say ten years back. The markets are signalling a recession and Chinese would be hoping for Trump recessions to blow apart Republicans in mid terms thus calling the bluff and not leading to submission what the US Administration seeks. Europe has also suggested taking counter measures specially on American tech companies. China has risen as a Tecno-Industrial power creating its financial architecture globally in form Digital Silk Road, integrating countries across the world in its sphere of influence. From launching Digital Yuan to AIIB to CIPS to launching Open-Source AI models to manufacturing semiconductor chips China has come a long way in challenging American dominance. The American administration needs a rude awakening that world has changed. China has risen as power in the east, Russia is not defeated in Ukraine and India is on its path to becoming the world’s third largest economy. Trade wars are nothing but pathways to ruin. What American tech needs is not protectionism but allies-shoring i.e. working with allies in Indo-Pacific to secure critical supply chains. Raising protectionist barriers will only make America an untrustworthy ally leaving vacuum for China to fill-in across vast swaths of the world. The American unilateralism should make India, Russia and other middle powers in Asia think whether America can be trusted as reliable trade partner given it is seeking to impose predatory policies to secure its interests. Thus, countries like India & Russia must push forward for a multi-polar world order amid growing bi-polarity between US & China. ### **Conclusion: The Road Ahead** The Trump-era tariffs and the broader U.S.-China trade war could leave an indelible mark on the Indian economy. What began as a distant clash between two economic titans can quickly became a global contagion of protectionism, redrawing trade routes and rewriting supply chain logic across continents. For India, this is not just a foreign policy challenge or an economic speed bump it is a strategic moment of truth. India thus should be mindful of though not retaliating to escalate things but at the same time do not give into submission of American terms & conditions for a trade deal which may go beyond tariffs into Food Security, Agriculture, Intellectual property rights and much more. India’s best policy would be to backstop its industry and manufacturing with incentives and subsidies while negotiating with USA on trade tariffs making the Trump recession play out hoping for a better deal. The macroeconomic toll of Trump tariffs and trade war on the global economy is real. Growth projections have dimmed across the world, inflation may rise again due to supply chain disruptions, and the world economy could face a prolonged recession just like the 1930s. India must bear in mind that America does not want another China in India and China also does not seek another China in Asia. Thus, while America might aim to cripple India’s manufacturing sector from Pharma to Electronics to Semi-Conductors, China on other hand seeks to curtail India’s manufacturing by withholding access to raw materials, machine parts to scale up. Trump tariffs in essence seeks to make India a trade territory for American corporates akin to pre-independence British India i.e. a frontline ally and a service backend. Trump tariffs are indeed setback to India’s dream of becoming a manufacturing powerhouse replacing China, a blue print that the Quad leaders had agreed to in 2021 in de-risking the supply chains post Covid-19. Instead of taking right approach of near shoring & ally-shoring i.e. working with allies to secure supply chains. The Trump Administration has in total disregard of the QUAD agreements, Mineral Security Partnership taken unilateral measures to take the world back to1930s by raising protectionist barriers against friends & foes alike. Several key lessons emerge for India from this the Trump tariffs saga. First, over-dependence on any single market, no matter how lucrative or historically stable, is a strategic vulnerability. India’s export ecosystem must be geographically diversified and technologically advanced, capable of withstanding sudden policy shocks. Second, sectors that rely on low-cost advantages without high-value differentiation are particularly exposed in times of geopolitical flux. The road to resilience lies in climbing the value chain, not just expanding production volume. Third, diplomacy and trade are now inseparable. Economic negotiations are increasingly being shaped by geopolitical considerations like alliances, defense pacts, technology transfer agreements and India must continue to build its leverage accordingly. Looking ahead, India stands at an inflection point. The next decade will likely be defined by the inversion of globalization, from open flows to strategic corridors, from efficiency to security, from cost arbitrage to trust-based partnerships. In this new world order, India has the opportunity to emerge not just as a substitute for China, but as a distinct economic force an engine of innovation, sustainability, and balanced growth. To do so, the country must invest aggressively in its people, its infrastructure, its digital and physical connectivity. It must build institutions that can weather international headwinds and foster a policy environment that rewards risk-taking and long-term thinking. It must see trade not as a peripheral activity, but as central to its national interest deserving of the same strategic attention as defense or energy. The Trump tariffs, as disruptive and painful as they are, offer a glimpse into the volatility of the modern economic landscape. But they also presented India with a test and, arguably, a gift. A test of resilience, of vision, of adaptability. And a gift of acceleration: a jolt that has forced uncomfortable but necessary shifts, catalyze reforms, and reveal new possibilities. In the ashes of these tariff wars, India can find a clearer sense of purpose, and a renewed determination to shape its own economic destiny and lead the world specially global south towards more equitable and fair trade. 4 2 [Share](javascript:void(0)) PreviousNext #### Discussion about this post CommentsRestacks ![User's avatar](fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png) TopLatestDiscussions No posts Ready for more?

The announcement of sweeping US tariffs on 2 April threw global trade turmoil into sharper relief, and sent markets reeling. According to [one analysis](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/nowhere-to-hide-tariffs-reshape-global-trade) there hadn’t been a change to the world trading system as significant since the 1947 General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, a seminal undertaking that kickstarted a long process of undoing trade barriers. Suddenly, in tandem with other levies enacted this year, the anticipated average effective US tariff rate was pegged at 22.5% – a 20-percentage-point increase compared with the prior year, and [its highest level since 1909](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/where-we-stand-fiscal-economic-and-distributional-effects-all-us-tariffs-enacted-2025-through-april).
