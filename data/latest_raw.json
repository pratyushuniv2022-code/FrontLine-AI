Previously, 28 people from the district worked in the Maoist party and their number has come down now because of the efforts being made by the State Government and Bhadradri Kothagudem Police to wean away Maoist’s influence in the district. The family members of the underground Maoists have to take the responsibility of encouraging the Maoists to surrender for leading a normal life. The government provides support for the rehabilitation of surrendered Maoists, the SP said, adding that the Maoist leaders were terrorising innocent tribals and forcing them to join the banned Maoist party to engage them in illegal activities for their selfish interests. Knowingly and unknowingly, some went underground and now find it difficult to join the mainstream of life. **Read less...** | | May - 2 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders are resorting to acts of violence in Bhadradri Kothagudem District of Telangana, said Bhadrachalam, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Paritosh Pankaj, on May 2, reports Telangana Today.

In a statement, ASP Pankaj said, Maoists were committing criminal offences to show their presence and harassing the innocent tribal people of the agency areas. The Naxals \\[Left Wing extremists, LWEs\\] have become obstacles to development. The top leaders of the Maoist party were compelling their lower-level cadres to commit illegal activities with the aim of extorting money and troubling innocent tribals in many ways for their selfish interests. Minor boys and girls were being tortured by the Naxals forcing them to join the Maoist party. The ASP noted that many cadres attracted by the ‘Operation Chayutha’ are planning to surrender, but they were being prevented doing so by Maoist top leadership. **Read less...** | | May - 11 | Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today. In a statement the official said that Maoist top leadership for the wellbeing of their family members have been making the lower ranks scapegoats. Innocent Adivasi youths were being forced to join the Maoist party and giving them arms to attack Police forces. For the selfish needs of Maoists, the lives of Adivasi boys and girls were being spoiled as they were deprived of education. Maoists like Sodi Jogaiah, Rajesh, Sodi Mada and others, killed in encounters, were made to join the Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] when they were minor in age and the party top leadership should take responsibility for their deaths, the SP said. Maoist leaders Damodar, Azad, Aruna and others sending ill-gotten money to their family members but meting out injustice to Adivasi families, which were compelled to sacrifice their children for Maoist leaders, SP, Vineeth noted. **Read less...** | | May - 13 | Drones will be put into service to keep an eye on the movements of the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) in Koraput, Odisha Director General of Police (DGP) Sunil Kumar Bansal said on May 13 during his visit to the district, reports sambadenglish.com.

Previously, operations in **Read more...** Security Forces (SFs) in Bastar are all set to launch ‘Operation Monsoon’ — a major anti-Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) campaign — in the interiors and border areas of the insurgency-hit districts from June to September, reports The Times of India on June 27. Previously, operations in remote and interior areas used to be paused during the rains, inadvertently giving space to Maoists to carry out recruitment drives or hold meetings with villagers. For the past three-four years, however, specially trained units of state and central security forces have pressed on with operations in forests in monsoon, resulting in the killing of 29 Maoists in encounters since 2020. The past years’ operations have been an example against the perceived notion that security forces wouldn’t be able to carry out operations due to overflowing nullahs, canals and slippery terrain in the forests of Bastar, a Police officer said. Bastar range Inspector general of Police (IGP) Sundarraj P told that security camps established in more than 60 spots in the remote areas have “choked the Maoists” and become “bottleneck points” for movement of the insurgents, while giving forces access to the forests. “Earlier, operations would be stalled but for the past 3-4 years, our ops continue during the (rainy) season, bringing results. CRPF \\[Central Reserve Police Force\\], CoBRA \\[Commando Battalion for resolute Action\\] and Special Task Force \\[STF\\] will be carrying out operations as they are well trained in jungle warfare. An action plan is in place to deal with the challenges of monsoon in the forest and conduct searches,” Sundarraj said. The inter-state operations on bordering areas like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra will also be intensified in the coming weeks and the jawans were well equipped for it. The morale of SFs is high despite casualties, the senior Police officer said. “We have recorded significant positive operational outcomes during this monsoon, since we have made decisive inroads into the erstwhile Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] strongholds by opening strategic operational base camps,” said Sundarraj. **Read less...** | | July - 12 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kot **Read more...** The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kothagudem of Telangana on July 12, reports Telangana Today. Jagan called upon the public to revolt against the ‘fascist Brahmanical Hindutva agenda of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of the UCC. As the people’s opposition towards the BJP’s nine-year rule was on the rise, the BJP was planning to execute its divisive and communal agenda. Through the UCC, Hindutva forces want to create a nefarious divisive line based on religion prior to the five state elections and the general election in 2024. In the last nine years of Narendra Modi's rule, the Indian economy has witnessed prolonged stagnation and decline, he said. Poverty, diseases, the gap between the rich and the poor, and attacks on minorities, dalits, and adivasis have reached levels never seen before. More than 800 million people have been pushed below the poverty line. Jagan noted that the BJP was trying to divert all these from the public’s mind. There would be a threat to the religious rights of minorities, tribals, and even Hindus because of the UCC. The BJP was also dehumanising the Muslim community and wrongly projecting them. There was a need to build a mass movement against the UCC, Jagan added. **Read less...** | | July - 13 | The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. The Maoist leaders for whom wanted notices were issued are Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, and Venkata Ravi Chaitanya alias Aruna. In its statement, the NIA said Aruna and Gajarla Ravi are the key executors of the Maoist strategies in Andhra Pradesh. The NIA informed us further that Aruna led the Maoist group that killed the former MLAs. The double murder took place while Kidari Sarveshwara Rao and Siveri Soma were visiting an interior village in the Araku assembly constituency of Andhra Pradesh. NIA re-registered the case on December 6, 2018 and took up the investigation. In June 2021, the NIA filed a supplementary chargesheet in the case against a woman area committee member of the Maoist group. The NIA said the woman Maoist leader, whom they identified as Kalavathi alias Bhavani, was instrumental in providing logistical support to the team that carried out the killing. **Read less...** | | July - 14 | Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Time **Read more...** Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Times of India on July 15. Maharashtra forces, which have already alerted the Central Government about the Maoists trying to bounce back in Chhattisgarh, have put their security and intelligence units on high alert on the stretch between Kanker-Narayanpur and Bijapur national park. A senior official from the security and intelligence wings said around 1,000 cadres have been recruited by the Maoists in Dantewada and Sukma regions. Another 200–250 new cadres were recruited by the Maoists in South Bastar. \"Earlier, there were barely 50–100 cadres in south Bastar and 200–400 in Dantewada and Sukma, which now have swelled to a substantial number after fresh recruitment,\" said the official. He said the concern was that Maoists would regroup and try to bounce back to their former strength in Chhattisgarh, which would not augur well for Gadchiroli and Gondia across the border in Maharashtra. Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) Sandip Patil, also the chief of the Anti-Naxal Operations (ANO) for Maharashtra, said the central government has been briefed about the developments in Chhattisgarh, which may now affect Maharashtra too, but did not divulge further details. \"Maharashtra forces are ready with strategies to counter any fresh threats,\" he said. It’s been learned that the Maoists are planning major attacks on Police posts that the Governments of different states are opening in their strongholds in central India. The Maoists’ ‘technical and research’ wing is said to be developing Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED) to blow them up near Police posts after mounting them on tractors or four-wheelers used in the rural areas.

The anti-Naxal crackdown by the Special Task Force (STF) along with other Security Forces (SFs) has dried up the weapons pipeline, leading to the number of armed extremists dropping drastically in the state, said a senior Police officer. \"Now the Bihar Police, in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and other concerned wings of the government, have intensified their crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui districts in the state\", Sushil Mansingh Khopde, Additional Director General (ADG-operations), STF, said. The ADG said despite law enforcement agencies destroying hundreds of acres of poppy plants each year, inputs suggest that clandestine opium poppy cultivation is present in certain pockets in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts. \"Inputs also suggest that Maoists \\[Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist)\\] have been using opium cultivation as a source of revenue in these areas. They levy a 'tax' on poppy cultivators and small enterprises. Law enforcement agencies destroyed around 600 acres of poppy plantation in these areas in 2021, and in 2022, around 1200 acres were destroyed\", the ADG said, adding, \"The concerned district police and other agencies have been instructed to keep a vigil on clandestine opium poppy cultivation in specific areas in the district.\" Further, ADG Khopde said, \"The number of Maoist-affected districts will further reduce in the coming months. No major Maoist incidents have been reported till June this year. Some armed cadres are only concentrated on the hills of Chakarbandha on the Gaya-Aurangabad border near Jharkhand and in the hilly areas of Jamui and Lakhisarai-Munger. The STF and Central forces have confined them there. We will soon make these areas Naxal-free.\" **Read less...** | | July - 25 | Telangana Director General of Police (DGP) Anjani Kumar held a conference on Left Wing Extremism (LWE) with DGPs of three neighbouring states, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh, and senior representatives from the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the Central Reserve police Force (CRPF), to d **Read more...** Telangana Director General of Police (DGP) Anjani Kumar held a conference on Left Wing Extremism (LWE) with DGPs of three neighbouring states, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh, and senior representatives from the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the Central Reserve police Force (CRPF), to discuss on various issues related to LWE and decided to enhance joint operations for better results, in Hyderabad on July 25, reports indiaherald.com.

In a press note issued on November 23, the OSD reminded people that Maoists had issued a statement urging the people to boycott the impending Assembly elections slated for November 30. He, however, reassured the public of the foolproof security arrangements in place to ensure the smooth conduct of the elections. The Maoist action team, reportedly comprising members such as Kunjam Idumal alias Mahender, Kovvasi Ganga alias Mahesh, and others, has reportedly crossed into the Mulugu area with intentions to disrupt the elections. Their strategies allegedly involve targeting security personnel, people’s representatives, political leaders, and officials involved in election duties, instigating fear and chaos among the public. “To combat this threat, Mulugu police have initiated stringent measures, including drone surveillance, cordon search operations, tactical vehicle checks, and area dominance,” the OSD said, emphasizing the grave risk posed by the Maoists to politicians and others, urging the people to remain vigilant and cautious. **Read less...** | | November - 23 | Jharkhand Chief Minister (CM) Hemant Soren, on November 23, declared that the state Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) are in the concluding stages of eliminating Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] menace in the state, reports The Telegraph.

    "full_text": "# RedNovember Targets Government, Defense, and Technology Organizations _Note: The analysis cut-off date for this report was July 25, 2025_ ## Executive Summary In July 2024, Insikt Group publicly [reported](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0716.pdf) on TAG-100, a threat activity group conducting suspected cyber-espionage activity targeting high-profile government, intergovernmental, and private sector organizations globally using the open-source, multi-platform Go backdoor Pantegana. At the time, we did not attribute this activity to a particular country; however, after reviewing all available evidence, we assess that TAG-100 is highly likely a Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group. Accordingly, Insikt Group now tracks this group under the designation RedNovember. Between June 2024 and July 2025, RedNovember (which overlaps with Storm-2077) targeted perimeter appliances of high-profile organizations globally and used the Go-based backdoor Pantegana and Cobalt Strike as part of its intrusions. The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms. Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified new likely victims, which include a ministry of foreign affairs in central Asia, a state security organization in Africa, a European government directorate, and a Southeast Asian government. RedNovember also likely compromised at least two United States (US) defense contractors, a European engine manufacturer, and a trade-focused intergovernmental cooperation body in Southeast Asia. We observed RedNovember reconnoitering and likely compromising edge devices for initial access, including SonicWall, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), F5 BIG-IP, Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect, Sophos SSL VPN, and Fortinet FortiGate instances, as well as Outlook Web Access (OWA) instances and Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN appliances. RedNovember’s activity exemplifies the ability to combine weaponized proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits with open-source post-exploitation frameworks such as Pantegana, lowering the entry barrier for less-capable threat actors. It also allows higher-tier groups to refrain from using customized tools during operations in which they are less concerned with being detected or in which heightened attribution obfuscation is desirable. Insikt Group followed responsible disclosure procedures in advance of this publication per Recorded Future's notification policy. ## Key Findings - RedNovember continues to rely on command-and-control (C2) frameworks (Pantegana and Cobalt Strike) and open-source backdoors (SparkRAT) for its operations. - The threat group has significantly broadened its targeting, including by conducting spearphishing and vulnerability exploitation attempts against entities in the US Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and space organizations in Europe. - At least some of the RedNovember activity that Insikt Group observed, including in Taiwan and Panama, took place in close proximity to geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China. - RedNovember has also increasingly focused its initial access efforts on targeting edge devices, including security solutions such as VPNs, firewalls, load balancers, virtualization infrastructure, and email servers. - In April 2025, the threat group conducted a campaign focused on the reconnaissance and targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices across multiple countries. Specific targets included a major US newspaper and a specialized US engineering and military contractor. ## Background RedNovember (previously tracked as TAG-100 and overlapping with Storm-2077) is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber-espionage group that leverages open-source tools and exploits internet-facing devices to target government, intergovernmental, and private sector organizations globally. Insikt Group has previously publicly [reported](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0716.pdf) on RedNovember’s use of the multi-platform Go-based backdoor Pantegana and other offensive security tools, including Cobalt Strike and SparkRAT, coupled with exploitation of perimeter appliances, to conduct reconnaissance, initial access, and probable compromise activities. RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution, a tactic that aligns with broader state-sponsored cyber-espionage trends that Insikt Group has observed. Combining weaponized proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits and open-source tools enables RedNovember to operate at scale. RedNovember’s activity highlights the persistent vulnerabilities of perimeter devices, which remain a significant risk vector due to limited visibility and logging capabilities. RedNovember is one of multiple [other](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf) Chinese state-sponsored threat groups that are increasingly achieving initial access to targets by targeting vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices, including security products. Targeting internet-facing devices has proven to be an effective way for Chinese state-sponsored threat groups to scale initial access and achieve initial footholds in large numbers of organizations ahead of more targeted follow-on activity. ## Technical Analysis Since our initial [public report](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0716.pdf) on its activity, RedNovember has continued to use the Pantegana C2 framework and Cobalt Strike as part of its intrusion activity. From our visibility and collection, RedNovember also highly likely continues to use ExpressVPN to administer its servers and may, with realistic probability, have started using other VPNs such as Warp VPN to remotely connect to its infrastructure. **_Figure 1:_** _Overview of RedNovember operations (Source: Recorded Future)_ While monitoring RedNovember’s active C2 servers, Insikt Group observed a number of victims on a global scale across the public and private sectors, but concentrated in the following verticals: aerospace and defense, government, and professional services. In addition to suspected compromise activity by RedNovember, we observed other network communications between multiple organizations and C2 servers associated with RedNovember, likely reflecting, at a minimum, general browsing activity and potentially reconnaissance efforts by the threat group. While the activity could be indicative of an intent to compromise, in these cases, there is currently insufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion. The terms “compromise,” “targeting,” “reconnaissance,” and “browsing\" are used specifically throughout this report to clarify the kind of activity observed. For example, where we assess that RedNovember compromised an entity, we will use terms such as “compromise” and “victim.” ### Victimology, Targeting, and Reconnaissance Between H2 2024 and H2 2025, RedNovember compromised, targeted, and reconnoitered organizations on a global scale. In particular, RedNovember heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, and, in April 2025, it focused its reconnaissance on over 30 Panamanian government organizations. **_Figure 2:_** _Mapping of countries with organizations compromised or targeted by RedNovember (Source: Recorded Future)_ #### Targeting of Government, Intergovernmental, and Diplomatic Entities RedNovember has targeted government and diplomatic organizations across many countries, as well as intergovernmental organizations. Insikt Group has identified the likely targeting of Outlook Web Access (OWA) portals belonging to a South American country prior to that country's state visit to China. Similar RedNovember activity has been observed targeting OWA portals belonging to ministries of foreign affairs in Southeast Asia and South America. Since at least mid-2024, RedNovember has highly likely compromised the following targets: - A 3CX web client instance associated with the ministry responsible for museums in a western European country - A Zimbra Collaboration Suite server associated with a Southeast Asian country - A Fortinet FortiGate appliance likely associated with the foreign affairs ministry of an East Asian country - A Huawei router likely associated with a Southeast Asian government - An African government’s Cisco ASA appliance Insikt Group also observed communications suggesting a long-running compromise of an intergovernmental organization based in Southeast Asia at least up until March 2025. Other Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, including RedDelta, have previously targeted official intergovernmental organizations in Southeast Asia, likely for the purposes of espionage. Additionally, in March and April 2025, Insikt Group observed evidence suggesting the likely compromise of an additional intergovernmental organization based in Southeast Asia. ##### Taiwan Between December 9, 2024, and December 16, 2024, Insikt Group observed communications from a RedNovember malicious server, _198\\[.\\]98\\[.\\]50\\[.\\]218_, also hosting a Pantegana C2, to a location in Taiwan that is home to a Taiwan Air Force military airbase and is also a primary location for semiconductor research and development. On December 9, 2024, China [conducted](https://www.dw.com/en/china-breaks-silence-on-large-military-drills-around-taiwan/a-71042704) a surprise military exercise around Taiwan, which involved around 90 warships and coast guard vessels and included simulating attacks on foreign ships and practicing the blockading of sea routes. In April 2025, RedNovember also conducted reconnaissance against infrastructure associated with two national scientific research organizations in Taiwan, including one focusing on research and development work related to semiconductors. ##### South Korea Insikt Group first observed RedNovember targeting South Korea in late August 2024. Between late August 2024 and March 2025, RedNovember compromised a Korean nonprofit organization in the financial services sector. The organization was observed communicating with several of the threat group’s Pantegana C2 servers. Korean organizations were also targeted as part of RedNovember’s April 2025 exploitation wave against Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices, such as when Insikt Group observed the suspected compromise of a nuclear safety-related organization in South Korea funded by the Korean government, which is a top research and development entity and has been significantly involved in South Korea’s supercomputing and quantum computing efforts. RedNovember also conducted reconnaissance against ICS VPN appliances on a Korean telecommunications company, a Korean marine vessel classification organization, and a Korean national research university. #### Broad Targeting of Panamanian Government Entities Between April 22 and April 24, 2025, Insikt Group observed a significant effort by RedNovember to scan and likely reconnoiter over 30 Panamanian organizations, the majority of which are related to the Panamanian government. Targeted devices and organizations included Panamaian government bodies focused on finance, international relations, and transportation. The targeting also included several other government ministries, including ones focused on land and economic development and emergency services organizations. The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s visit to Panama in early April 2025, and may have been triggered at least in part by several remarks made by US President Donald Trump during January and February 2025 that suggested US interest in asserting control over the Panama Canal. On April 9, 2025, Secretary Hegseth [announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an “expanded partnership” with Panama to counter Chinese influence in the canal. Additionally, in February 2025, following a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Panama President José Raúl Mulino [announced](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/02/04/panama-drops-belt-and-road-agreement-with-china-after-us-pressure_6737775_4.html) that the country would formally leave China’s flagship foreign development project Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), by not renewing the current Memorandum of Understanding, and that Panama would also [review](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/panama-said-to-mull-canceling-port-deal-with-hong-kong-firm) its contracts with Hong Kong firm Hutchison PPC, which currently manages Panama’s ports of Balboa and Cristóbal. An agreement on the sale involving the two ports to a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock and MSC (Mediterranean Shipping Company), set to be signed during the first week of April 2025, had [reportedly](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-panama-canal-take-back-military-china-blackrock-rcna199438) been delayed under pressure from China. **_Figure 3:_** _Breakdown of RedNovember reconnaissance and compromise activity by country between June 2024 and May 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)_ #### Targeting of US and European Defense and Aerospace Organizations In July 2024, Insikt Group observed RedNovember conduct a broad reconnaissance campaign exclusively targeting prominent aerospace and defense organizations, with a particular focus on the US. This activity involved suspected port scanning from the RedNovember IP address _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]57_ against these networks. There was no evidence to suggest a successful compromise or exploitation took place against these entities. However, this activity demonstrated that RedNovember was expanding its targeting to include the US defense industrial base and other global defense organizations. In the first half of 2025, Insikt Group has observed further RedNovember reconnaissance activity and compromises targeting this sector. In April 2025, communications were observed between a RedNovember reconnaissance and vulnerability exploitation server and infrastructure associated with a European space focused research center. As part of its April 2025 targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices, RedNovember targeted a specialized US engineering and military contractor. Insikt Group observed direct connections between the same RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 and exploitation server and two of the organization’s ICS VPN Internet-facing endpoints over a period of two days; however, there is currently no sufficient evidence to conclude that RedNovember succeeded in compromising the target. Also in April 2025, RedNovember conducted extensive reconnaissance against an IP address space associated with a higher education institution associated with the US Navy. Insikt Group did not observe evidence of the organization being compromised. #### Targeting of the Private Sector ##### European Manufacturing Companies In March 2025, Insikt Group identified direct reconnaissance and communications with RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2s that indicated RedNovember’s possible compromise of a European engine manufacturer. The threat group targeted a SonicWall VPN device and login pages for the company’s F5 BIG-IP devices and VDI environment. RedNovember also browsed to a server that hosts a SonicWall SonicOS and a SonicWall SSL VPN instance for a UK-based defense contractor. Additionally, also in March 2025, Insikt Group observed RedNovember-controlled IP address _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]24_ browsing to a SonicWall SonicOS and SonicWall SSL-VPN instance of a United Kingdom (UK)-based company focusing on bespoke cable harnessing, including for aerospace, military and defense, and medical applications. ##### Law Firms (Globally) The group compromised a SonicWall SonicOS and SSL VPN device belonging to an American law firm in April 2025. RedNovember also targeted IP addresses, including a Palo Alto GlobalProtect Gateway Httpd sever, associated with a global law firm that has been involved in a debt restructuring project with a Chinese company. ##### Taiwanese Technology Companies Between at least July 2024 and March 2025, RedNovember compromised a Taiwanese IT company using the Pantegana C2 IP addresses _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]57\\[.\\]116_ and _205\\[.\\]185\\[.\\]126\\[.\\]208_. RedNovember has shown particular interest in Taiwanese companies, particularly ones related to semiconductors and technology, as well as Taiwanese government bodies related to science. ##### US Oil and Gas Companies In April 2025, RedNovember conducted reconnaissance of two American oil and gas companies. Insikt Group had previously publicly [reported](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-100-uses-open-source-tools-in-suspected-global-espionage-campaign) on RedNovember targeting American utilities organizations in 2024, in the context of a campaign targeting Palo Alto GlobalProtect devices. #### Broad Targeting of Fijian Government, Financial, Transportation, and Media Entities In July 2024, Insikt Group identified a surge in RedNovember activity targeting over 50 Fijian organizations via the actor-controlled IP addresses _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]57_ and _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]47\\[.\\]6_. This activity exclusively targeted OWA and Sophos UTM login portals of these organizations. Notable targets included multiple Fijian financial institutions, transportation authorities, media, and government organizations. In particular, the identified targeting of multiple land, sea, and air transportation authorities aligns with ongoing Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) interests within Fiji ( [1](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3243118/fiji-woos-china-upgrade-strategically-important-ports-even-debt-concerns-mount), [2](https://fijionenews.com.fj/fiji-enters-into-300m-china-bri-deal/)), exemplifying RedNovember activity correlating with Chinese state interests. #### Surge Targeting of Edge Devices and Vulnerability Exploitation RedNovember has repeatedly conducted surge targeting of specific edge devices following the disclosure of vulnerabilities and the publication of PoC exploit code for those same devices. Insikt Group has also observed evidence that the group has targeted the Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190) and a Microsoft Exchange server. RedNovember has a history of targeting vulnerabilities in edge devices. In April 2024, following the release of a PoC exploit for the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect firewall remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability CVE-2024-3400, the group likely [conducted](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-100-uses-open-source-tools-in-suspected-global-espionage-campaign) reconnaissance and exploitation activity against Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect appliances associated with American education, finance, legal, local government, and utilities organizations. ##### Targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure VPN in April 2025 In April 2025, RedNovember conducted a campaign focused on the reconnaissance and targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices across multiple countries. Specific targets included a major American newspaper, a specialized US engineering and military contractor, and two prominent Korean institutes associated with scientific research and nuclear regulation. ##### Likely Targeting of Check Point VPN Gateways Following CVE-2024-24919 PoC Publication From June 3 to June 6, 2024, Insikt Group observed outbound communications from RedNovember IP address _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]47\\[.\\]6_ to Check Point VPN gateways linked to at least 60 organizations, mainly in Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the US (see **Figure 4**). This activity appeared relatively opportunistic, with minimal themes identified across targeted organizations. Notably, on May 30, 2024, a PoC exploit was [published](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/) for the arbitrary file read vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 affecting multiple Check Point VPN gateway products, which led to widespread [exploitation](https://www.greynoise.io/blog/whats-going-on-with-checkpoint-cve-2024-24919) in the wild by multiple threat actors. While unconfirmed, the timing of the RedNovember activity suggests that the group may have attempted to exploit this vulnerability following the publication of this PoC. Similar behavior by RedNovember was previously noted concerning the targeting of Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, which closely aligned with the release of a public PoC for the arbitrary file creation vulnerability CVE-2024-3400. **_Figure 4:_** _Breakdown of RedNovember Check Point VPN targeting by country in early June 2024_ _(Source: Recorded Future)_ ### Tools Used by RedNovember #### LESLIELOADER and SparkRAT Insikt Group identified two LESLIELOADER samples used by RedNovember to load SparkRAT. The group has previously used a variant of the [publicly available](https://github.com/HZzz2/go-shellcode-loader) Go-based loader LESLIELOADER to load SparkRAT, including in a chain documented by Kroll [research](https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/leslieloader-undocumented-loader-observed?) in March 2024. **SHA256 Hash** **SparkRAT C2 IP Address** `8679a25c78e104c6e74996b75882e378f420614fe1379ee9c1e266a11ffa096d` 209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]57 `06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2` 107\\[.\\]189\\[.\\]8\\[.\\]240 **_Table 1:_** _RedNovember LESLIELOADER samples used to load SparkRAT (Source: Recorded Future)_ The 06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2 sample was first uploaded to a public malware repository within a ZIP file (SHA256: 675874ac8fbe66e76244759ae398a4d30da84ef2435a1384c4be549ca9eba18b), which also contained a PDF lure document (SHA256: 1e37efcd3cd647e6ce5414ae8e353ca690c2d3f7a701a1cc2ec29a4813f5c90b). The PDF lure, which was highly likely delivered via email-based spearphishing, purported to come from the IT department of a US Navy contractor company, and directed targets receiving the file to download and install the LESLIELOADER sample from the threat actor-controlled malicious domain _download\\[.\\]offiec\\[.\\]us\\[.\\]kg_. The LESLIELOADER executable masqueraded as a security patch for VMware software, and its filename included the specific name of the US contractor company being targeted. #### LESLIELOADER and Cobalt Strike In May 2025, Insikt Group identified two additional samples of LESLIELOADER used to load Cobalt Strike Beacon in memory. **SHA256 Hash** **Cobalt Strike C2 IP Address** `134ed0407956ff1ac59f38e89742e357cc3be565cbaff18b424ed1bcfd130978` 47\\[.\\]103\\[.\\]218\\[.\\]35 `2bee2cc42322e928bfa0650c5416b14bc0200f2d1156304179d63982baa835dc` **_Table 2:_** _RedNovember LESLIELOADER samples used to load Cobalt Strike (Source: Recorded Future)_ Notably, in this case, the server was hosted in China, specifically on ALIBABA-CN-NET (AS37963), and the Cobalt Strike service was run on TCP port 80. #### Additional Malicious Documents Insikt Group also identified a malicious Word document directing victims to the RedNovember-controlled domain _login\\[.\\]offiec\\[.\\]us\\[.\\]kg_ (SHA256: 9a1077f57bac5610d44ac46a8958dd5469522a3db466f164f4dfeada73847b79), specifically to the URL: _hxxps://login\\[.\\]offiec\\[.\\]us\\[.\\]kg/ms-help.html._ The subdomain name “offiec” could be a typosquat reference to the Microsoft Office suite. The file was last modified on August 14, 2024, and was first submitted to a public malware scanner on August 15, 2024. The `ms-help.html` file (SHA256: dba860617762bc713771de351026eb683546b37489fa0359064948f263438030) downloaded by the Word document appears to have been an exploit for the Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-3019). #### Other Potential Tools Insikt Group has observed RedNovember using multiple file-sharing websites and tools to scan for vulnerabilities. **pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk** In October 2024, Insikt Group observed connections between a RedNovember server and the website _pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk_, an anonymous file-sharing website. This website has been previously [highlighted](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/ivanti-post-exploitation-lateral-movement) by Mandiant as being used by a suspected China-based threat actor, UNC5266, as part of an exploitation campaign targeting Ivanti devices in 2024. UNC5266 allegedly used the file-sharing website to stage malware payloads and attempted to retrieve them through `curl` and `wget` requests to specific URL paths on the website. Insikt Group does not currently have evidence to substantiate any links between UNC5266 and RedNovember. Since at least January 23, 2025, and as of July 22, 2025, the domain’s landing page displays a Chinese-language message which in translation reads as: “Statement on the abuse of ‘pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk’ by cyber attackers.” The statement acknowledges that recent public reporting has highlighted suspect misuse of the platform by cyber threat actors, stating that it has no connection to such incidents and that it abides by applicable laws and regulations. According to the statement, the platform is temporarily unavailable while work is being conducted to “optimize the download logic and add authentication verification.” **_Figure 5:_** _Statement on the pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk main page (Source: urlscan.io)_ **PortSwigger** RedNovember connected on multiple occasions to the PortSwigger website. PortSwigger provides tools for web application security testing and scanning. Its main product, Burp Suite, is widely used by security researchers — and, occasionally, by threat actors — to test and scan web applications for vulnerabilities. **Filemail** RedNovember connected to a dedicated Filemail instance with a domain of _3008\\[.\\]filemail\\[.\\]com_. Filemail is a cloud-based file transfer service solution that allows users to upload, send, and share large files via email or shareable links. **Acunetix** In at least one instance, a RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 server ran the vulnerability scanner tool Acunetix, suggesting that the threat group may also be using this tool as part of its reconnaissance activity. **Hacker Target** RedNovember used one of its servers to access the _hackertarget\\[.\\]com_ website in April 2025. Hacker Target provides a free online vulnerability scanner platform with multiple features, including Nmap and ZMap scans, and domain and server profiling. **Wayback Machine** In April 2025, RedNovember used at least two of its servers to navigate to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Insikt Group did not have visibility into what the threat group queried in the archive. **Crt\\[.\\]sh** Also in April 2025, RedNovember accessed _crt\\[.\\]sh_, a free online TLS certificate transparency service that allows users to look up TLS certificate logs by domain or certificate hash. **Gofile\\[.\\]io** Additionally, in April 2025, RedNovember connected to the free cloud storage service _gofile\\[.\\]io_, suggesting that the threat actor might have uploaded or browsed files from an account it held on the platform. As highlighted above, RedNovember has previously used similar services, such as the aforementioned _pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk_. ## Mitigations Organizations should take the following measures to detect and mitigate observed TTPs associated with RedNovember activity: - Detect and block malicious infrastructure such as Pantegana, SparkRAT, and Cobalt Strike C2 servers in real time via the [Recorded Future® Threat Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence) module. - [Recorded Future® Third-Party Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence) module users can monitor real-time output to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity involving key vendors and partners within physical, network, and software supply chains. - By monitoring Infrastructure Analysis events, Recorded Future customers can alert on and monitor RedNovember C2 IP addresses. - By monitoring Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA), Recorded Future customers can alert on and proactively monitor infrastructure involved in notable communication to known RedNovember C2 IP addresses. - Ensure a risk-based approach for patching vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and those exploited in the wild as determined through the [Recorded Future® Vulnerability Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence) module. The public availability of exploit code can substantially increase the likelihood of mass exploitation ( [1](https://www.securityweek.com/poc-published-fortinet-vulnerability-mass-exploitation-attempts-begin/), [2](https://www.securityweek.com/exploitation-of-palo-alto-firewall-vulnerability-picking-up-after-poc-release/), [3](https://www.securityweek.com/mass-exploitation-of-citrix-bleed-vulnerability-underway/)). To specifically protect against some Chinese state-sponsored groups, pay particular attention to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in external-facing appliances within your environment. - Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking connection attempts to and from — the external IP addresses and domains linked in **Appendix A**. - Ensure security monitoring and detection capabilities are in place for all external-facing services and devices. Monitor for follow-on activity likely to occur following exploitation of these external-facing services, such as the deployment of web shells, backdoors, or reverse shells, as well as subsequent lateral movement to internal networks. - Regularly audit internet-facing and perimeter appliances, and reduce attack surfaces by disabling both internet-facing and internal interfaces or portals where no longer required, and by reducing appliances exposed to the internet to only those that are strictly required. - Consider logging capabilities and security product support when initially procuring network appliances, in order to be appropriately positioned to detect and respond to threats. - Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information; consider implementing multi-factor authentication and extremely restricted access and storage on systems only accessible via an internal network. - Focus on defense-in-depth strategies, such as detecting post-exploitation persistence, discovery, and lateral movement activities, as well as unusual network communications. Such strategies can aid detection and response to intrusions arising from the exploitation of both known and zero-day vulnerabilities. ## Outlook RedNovember has historically targeted a diverse range of countries and sectors, suggesting broad and changing intelligence requirements. Some of its activity appears to align with a military affiliation or military-adjacent interests, such as the targeting of specific entities in the US DIB, or the targeting of Taiwan around the time of China’s military exercises in Taiwan. However, there are different sets of targeting that do not closely match this pattern: for example, the targeting of law firms, newspaper organizations, and a Christian denomination in the US. Other clusters of RedNovember activity signal a clear interest in foreign governments and foreign policy, such as the targeting of international multilateral organizations based in Southeast Asia and government ministries in several Southeast Asian countries and South American countries, as well as the reconnaissance against dozens of Panamanian government departments in April 2025. Based on its visibility and collection, Insikt Group has observed that RedNovember’s activity to date has primarily focused on several key geographies, including the US, Southeast Asia, the Pacific region, and South America. While targets and victims have also been identified in Europe and at least one in Africa, the overall volume of activity directed toward these areas has been notably lower than that observed in the primary regions of focus. From a sector perspective, RedNovember continued targeting government organizations in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and South America, intergovernmental organizations in Southeast Asia, and religious organizations. However, since our first public report on the group, we have also observed RedNovember expand its targeting to defense and aerospace organizations, the private sector, and at least two news outlets. Insikt Group anticipates that RedNovember, along with other Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups, will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release. ## Appendix A: Indicators of Compromise ``` Domains: aeifile[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg citrix[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg cna[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg download[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg gp[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg login[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg test[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg vpn[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg vpn1[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg RedNovember Pantegana C2 IP Addresses: 45[.]61[.]187[.]124 198[.]98[.]50[.]218 198[.]98[.]53[.]163 198[.]98[.]61[.]155 209[.]141[.]37[.]254 205[.]185[.]126[.]208 205[.]185[.]124[.]24 209[.]141[.]42[.]131 209[.]141[.]46[.]83 209[.]141[.]57[.]116 RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 IP Address: 47[.]103[.]218[.]35 RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 URLs: hxxp://47[.]103[.]218[.]35/pixel hxxp://47[.]103[.]218[.]35/GSjY LESLIELOADER SHA256 hashes: 06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2 134ed0407956ff1ac59f38e89742e357cc3be565cbaff18b424ed1bcfd130978 2bee2cc42322e928bfa0650c5416b14bc0200f2d1156304179d63982baa835dc 8679a25c78e104c6e74996b75882e378f420614fe1379ee9c1e266a11ffa096d ZIP file SHA256 hash: 675874ac8fbe66e76244759ae398a4d30da84ef2435a1384c4be549ca9eba18b PDF lure SHA256 hash: 1e37efcd3cd647e6ce5414ae8e353ca690c2d3f7a701a1cc2ec29a4813f5c90b Malicious Follina Word document SHA256 hashes: 9a1077f57bac5610d44ac46a8958dd5469522a3db466f164f4dfeada73847b79 dba860617762bc713771de351026eb683546b37489fa0359064948f263438030 ``` ## Appendix B: MITRE ATT&CK Techniques **Tactic: Technique** **ATT&CK Code** **Resource Development:** Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server [T1583.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003/) **Reconnaissance:** Gather Victim Network Information: Network Security Appliances [T1590.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1590/006/) **Initial Access:** Exploit Public-Facing Application [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/) **Initial Access**: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/) **Execution:** User Execution: Malicious Link [T1204.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001/) **Execution:** User Execution: Malicious File [T1204.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/) **Command and Control:** Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols [T1071.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001/) **Command and Control:** Non-Standard Port [T1571](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571/) ## Appendix C: LESLIELOADER YARA Rule ``` rule MAL_LESLIELOADER { meta: author = \"Insikt Group, Recorded Future\" date = \"2024-11-14\" description = \"Detects LESLIELOADER Malware used by RedNovember\" version = \"1.0\" hash = \"8679a25c78e104c6e74996b75882e378f420614fe1379ee9c1e266a11ffa096d\" hash = \"06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2\" malware = \"LESLIELOADER\" malware_id = \"u-6JwI\" category = \"MALWARE\" strings: $s1 = \".DecrptogAES\" $s2 = \".UnPaddingText1\" // AES key 1 $k1a = \"LeslieCh\" $k1b = \"eungKwok\" // AES key 2 $k2a = { 33 44 37 35 45 34 43 39 } $k2b = { 42 33 32 41 42 45 31 37 } condition: uint16be(0) == 0x4d5a and all of ($s*) and 2 of ($k*) } ``` ## Appendix D: RedNovember Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis",

It continues to be so.”_– Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.\\[i\\] _From Ideology To Warfare_ The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. _Resurgence_ Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. ### A New Strategy _“We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.”_-Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. _Overruns_ On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • **Used improvised explosive devices.** Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • **Assassinated officials.** In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • **Destroyed police infrastructure.** Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj _Systems Disruption_ At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? ### The Deviant Economic Engine _“The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.”_-Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. _The Revolutionary Tax_ In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. _A Revolutionary Tax Economy_ To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • **Mining.** Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • **Narcotics.** India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • **Informal tolls.** Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. ### A Strategic Half-Life _“It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they_ _look to the Naxals for justice.”_–Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future. _Sources:_ i Mahendra Kumawat, “Naxal Movement Has Shown Tremendous Grit,” Rediff News, April 9, 2010. ii Waquar Ahmed, Amitabh Kundu, and Richard Peet, India’s New Economic Policy: A Critical Analysis (New York: Routledge, 2011). iii Bibhudatta Pradhan and Santosh Kumar, “Pillai to End Maoist Grip on $80 Billion Investments,” Bloomberg Businessweek, September 17, 2010. iv Government of India, “Fact Sheet On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),” Ministry of Commerce and Industry, February 11, 2011, http://dipp.nic.in/fdi\\_statistics/india\\_FDI\\_February2011.pdf (accessed March 23, 2011). v Rahul Nilakantan and Saurabh Singhal, “The Economic Costs Of Naxalite Violence and the Economic Benefits of a Unique Robust Security Response,” 2010. http://www.aae.wisc.edu/mwiedc/papers/2011/Singhal\\_Saurabh.pdf (accessed April 3, 2011). vi “Chhattisgarh’s Entire Forest Area A Minefield?,” Times of India, May 10, 2010. vii Manoj Prasad, “Former Jharkhand CM Marandi on Their Hitlist, Naxals Kill Son, 17 More,” Indian Express, October 28, 2007. viii Press Trust of India, “Maoists Storm Jehanabad Jail,” Rediff News, November 14, 2005. ix Sudheer Pal Singh, “Illegal Mining May Impede Divestment in Coal India,” Business Standard, August 21, 2010. x Government of India, “Loss of Coal Production in Naxalite Areas,” Press Information Bureau, August 4, 2010, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=64116 (accessed January 4, 2011). xi “Chronology of Naxal Attacks on Trains,” India Today, May 28, 2010. xii Law Kumar Mishra, “Maoists Blow Up Track on Gaya-Dhanbad Section, Rail Traffic Disrupted,” Times of India, September 13, 2010. xiii “Naxal Attacks Doubled in 2009, Rlys Lost Rs 500cr: Mamata,” Times of India, April 23, 2010. xiv Manoj Prasad, “Naxal Attacks, Escalated Cost Derail Jharkhand Railway Projects,” India Express, April 12, 2010. xv Ishita Ayan Dutt, “Naxal Hits to Pull NMDC Net Down by Rs 1,000 cr,” Business Standard, April 20, 2010. xvi “NMDC to Lay 12 mt Pipeline on Highways to Avoid Naxal Attacks,” The Financial Express, July 20, 2010. xvii “Naxals Obstruct Road Works,” The Hindu, May 9, 2011. xviii Dutt. xix Sandeep Joshi, “550 More Mobile Towers to Boost Fight Against Naxalites,” The Hindu, June 30, 2010. xx “World Bank Approves $1.5 billion for India’s Rural Roads Scheme,” Press Trust of India, December 22, 2010. xxi Prassana Mohanty, “Maoists’ Financing – The Blood Flows as Long as the Cash Flows,” Governance Now, April 7, 2010. xxii Mohanty xxiii Sujeet Kumar, “Maoists extort Rs 300 Crore Annually in Chhattisgarh,” The Economic Times, July 5, 2009. xxiv Bharti Jain, “Rs 150 Crore: Maoists Extortion Amount From Chhattisgarh SSIs,” The EconomicTimes, April 10, 2010. xxv Ajit Kumar Singh and Sachin Bansidhar Diwan, “Red Money,” Outlook India, April 5, 2010. xxvi Ministry of Home Affairs, 2010-2011 Annual Report (Delhi: Government of India, 2011). xxvii Shaikh Azizur Rahman, “India’s Illegal Coal Mines Turn Into Death Pits,” The WashingtonTimes, November 24, 2006. xxviii Prasoon Majumdar, “Our Own Banana Republics!” Indian Institute of Planning andManagement, August 26, 2010, http://prasoonmajumdar.blogspot.com/2010/08/our-own-banana- republics.html (accessed April 29, 2011). xxix United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, “India is a Major Drug Hub: US,” September, 2007, http://www.unodc.org/india/en/rajiv\\_quoted\\_et.html (accessed February 25, 2011).

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "## Executive Summary The year 2025 is defined by a cybersecurity landscape of unprecedented velocity, complexity, and convergence. The volume and sophistication of cyber threats have escalated dramatically, with Q1 2025 data revealing a 47% year-over-year increase in weekly cyber attacks per organization and a 126% surge in ransomware incidents. This intensification is driven by a confluence of factors: the weaponization of Artificial Intelligence, persistent vulnerabilities across digital supply chains and the Internet of Things (IoT), and escalating geopolitical tensions fueling aggressive state-sponsored operations. The threat actor ecosystem is in a state of dynamic flux. Following major law enforcement disruptions, the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) market has fragmented, with new groups like **RansomHub**, **Play**, and **Akira** ascending to prominence. Concurrently, the lines between nation-state espionage and financially motivated cybercrime are blurring, exemplified by the emergence of hybrid threats like the **Warlock ransomware**, operated by the China-based actor **Storm-2603**, which targets critical infrastructure using zero-day vulnerabilities and novel data auction tactics. Major campaigns in 2025, such as the widespread compromise of Salesforce instances by the **ShinyHunters** group and the crippling ransomware attack on **Collins Aerospace's** aviation software, underscore the critical risk posed by supply chain vulnerabilities. In response, the global regulatory environment is rapidly maturing. Landmark regulations, including the EU's **NIS2 Directive** and **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)**, are coming into full effect, imposing stringent new requirements for cybersecurity, incident reporting, and supply chain risk management. In the U.S., the SEC's mandatory 4-day disclosure rule for material incidents, CISA's upcoming 72-hour reporting rule under **CIRCIA**, and significant proposed updates to the **HIPAA Security Rule** are forcing organizations to prioritize transparency and accountability. This confluence of escalating threats and stricter compliance mandates creates a clear strategic imperative for all organizations: a fundamental shift from reactive, perimeter-based security to proactive, integrated, and resilient defense strategies. The adoption of Zero Trust architecture, the development of robust AI governance, enhanced supply chain diligence, and a steadfast commitment to foundational cybersecurity hygiene are no longer best practices but essential conditions for survival and success in the 2025 threat environment. ## The Evolving Threat Landscape in 2025 ### 1.1. Escalation of Attack Volume and Severity Data from the first quarter of 2025 established a concerning baseline, indicating a high-velocity global threat landscape. - **Global Attack Volume:** The average number of weekly cyber attacks per organization surged by 47% compared to Q1 2024, reaching 1,925 attacks. - **Regional Disparities:** The growth was not uniform, with Latin America experiencing a 108% year-over-year increase, followed by Europe (+57%), North America (+40%), Africa (+39%), and the Asia-Pacific region (+38%). - **Targeted Sectors:** The most heavily targeted industries for all attack types were Education (4,484 weekly attacks), Government (2,678 weekly attacks), and Telecommunications (2,664 weekly attacks). The total economic cost of damages related to cyber warfare alone is estimated to reach **$13.1 billion** in 2025, a 21% increase from the previous year. ### 1.2. The Ransomware Ecosystem: Fragmentation and Adaptation Ransomware remains a primary driver of cyber losses, with Q1 2025 being a record-breaking period for attack volume. - **Unprecedented Growth:** Reported ransomware incidents increased by 126% compared to Q1 2024. - **Market Fragmentation:** Following law enforcement disruptions of major groups like LockBit and ALPHV/BlackCat in late 2024 and early 2025, the ecosystem has become more fragmented, with 70-80 active groups identified. This proliferation makes the threat environment more complex and less predictable. - **Dominant and Emerging Actors:** Analysis of the post-disruption landscape reveals a new cohort of leading threat actors. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Rank | Group | Key Characteristics | | 1 | **RansomHub** | Emerged as the new leader, filling the void left by LockBit. Attracted experienced affiliates with high commission splits (up to 90%). | | 2 | **Play** | Known for quiet consistency and operational execution rather than media theatrics. | | 3 | **Akira** | A veteran group that significantly ramped up its operational tempo and victim count in 2024 and 2025. | | 4 | **Qilin** | Notable for high-impact attacks on critical sectors like healthcare (e.g., Synnovis) and public services. | | 5 | **Medusa** | A long-time presence that became more aggressive in late 2024, targeting high-profile victims. | - **Evolving Tactics:** The \"double extortion\" method—encrypting data and threatening to leak stolen files—is now standard, occurring in 95% of incidents. To coerce payment, groups are employing more aggressive pressure tactics and innovating monetization strategies, such as the Warlock group's private auction of entire stolen datasets. ### 1.3. State-Sponsored Operations and Geopolitical Drivers Geopolitical instability is a significant factor in the threat landscape, directly influencing the cybersecurity strategies of nearly 60% of organizations. - **Prevalence:** State-sponsored campaigns accounted for a record **39%** of all major cyber attacks in 2025, impacting 76 countries. - **Key State Actors:** The United States, China, and Russia collectively accounted for 61% of all observed cyber warfare activity. China is identified as the most active and persistent cyber threat to U.S. government, private sector, and critical infrastructure networks. - **Primary Objectives:** Operations are focused on espionage (intellectual property theft, intelligence gathering) and the disruption of critical infrastructure. Attacks on energy, water, and transport sectors rose by 34% in 2025. - **Hybrid Threat Models:** A concerning trend is the blurring line between state-sponsored and financially motivated crime. The **Warlock ransomware** campaign, attributed to the China-based group **Storm-2603**, exemplifies this hybrid model, where nation-state capabilities are deployed for what appears to be financial gain. ### 1.4. Key Attack Vectors and Techniques Threat actors are refining their methods to maximize impact and evade detection. - **Supply Chain & Third-Party Compromise:** This vector was responsible for many of the year's most significant incidents. Attackers exploit trust relationships by targeting software vendors, managed service providers (MSPs), and cloud platforms. High-profile examples from 2025 include: - **Collins Aerospace:** A ransomware attack on its vMUSE aviation software disrupted multiple European airports. - **Salesforce Platform:** A widespread campaign by the ShinyHunters group compromised numerous Salesforce customers through social engineering, impacting companies like Air France-KLM, Cisco, and Allianz Life. - **Snowflake Platform:** A breach affecting the cloud database was linked to the massive Ticketmaster data theft. - **Other Vendors:** Breaches at third-party providers led to data exposure for companies like TransUnion, Harrods, and M&S. - **Living-off-the-Land (LotL):** A striking **79% of all threat detections were malware-free**, indicating a major shift towards using legitimate, built-in system tools (e.g., PowerShell, WMI, RDP) to conduct attacks. This technique allows adversaries to blend in with normal network activity and bypass traditional signature-based security. - **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:** Actors continue to successfully exploit both publicly known and zero-day vulnerabilities. In 2025, China-linked APT groups exploited flaws in Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, and Ivanti devices, while the Warlock group rapidly weaponized a critical zero-day chain in Microsoft SharePoint dubbed \"ToolShell.\" In September, the New York Department of Financial Services issued an alert for zero-days in Cisco ASA and Firepower appliances. - **Social Engineering and Credential Theft:** Phishing and social engineering remain the most dangerous threat vector, responsible for **47.5%** of attacks. Voice phishing (vishing) campaigns have proven highly effective, leading to breaches at companies like Cisco. ## The Transformative Role of Artificial Intelligence AI is rapidly becoming a defining element of the cyber conflict, serving as both a powerful weapon and an essential defense mechanism. ### 2.1. Offensive AI: A Threat Multiplier Adversaries are leveraging AI to increase the scale, speed, and sophistication of their attacks. - **Enhanced Social Engineering:** Generative AI is used to create hyper-personalized phishing emails, smishing texts, and vishing scripts at scale. AI-powered **deepfake** technology enables highly convincing impersonations for CEO fraud, as evidenced by a case where a finance employee was tricked into transferring **$25 million** after a deepfake video conference call. - **Automated Reconnaissance and Exploitation:** AI can automate network scanning, rapidly identify vulnerabilities (including zero-days), and map attack paths far more efficiently than human operators. - **Adaptive Malware:** AI is being used to generate polymorphic malware that constantly alters its code to evade detection. AI-driven attacks represented **22%** of all state-level cyber incidents in 2025. ### 2.2. Defensive AI Integration Defenders are increasingly integrating AI to counter advanced threats. - **Advanced Threat Detection:** AI and Machine Learning are crucial for analyzing massive data volumes to detect subtle anomalies indicative of stealthy attacks like LotL intrusions or zero-day exploits. - **Automated Incident Response:** AI-powered Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms can automate critical response actions—such as isolating compromised endpoints—at machine speed, dramatically reducing response times. - **Enhanced Analytics:** AI helps security teams correlate alerts across disparate tools (EDR, network, cloud) to identify complex attack chains and reduce alert fatigue. ### 2.3. AI Governance and Security Challenges The rapid adoption of AI has outpaced the implementation of necessary security and governance, creating significant new risks. - **\"Shadow AI\":** Only 37% of organizations have a security assessment process for AI tools before deployment, leading to the use of unsecured AI systems that introduce hidden vulnerabilities. - **AI-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Organizations must now defend against new threats targeting AI systems themselves, including data poisoning, model evasion, prompt injection, and algorithmic bias. - **Fragmented Regulation:** A complex patchwork of regulations is emerging globally, led by the EU's comprehensive **AI Act**, creating significant compliance challenges. ## Major Incidents and Case Studies of 2025 Several large-scale incidents in 2025 highlight the convergence of key threats and their potential for systemic disruption. | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Incident | Date | Victim(s) | Threat Actor / Method | Key Impact and Significance | | **Collins Aerospace Attack** | Sep 2025 | Multiple European Airports (Brussels, Heathrow, Dublin, etc.) | Ransomware on vMUSE software | Widespread flight disruptions, manual check-ins. Demonstrates critical risk in specialized software supply chains. | | **Warlock Ransomware Campaign** | Summer 2025 | Colt Technology, Orange Telecom, U.S. Nuclear Agency, others | **Storm-2603** (China-linked); SharePoint \"ToolShell\" zero-day | Targeted critical infrastructure; showcased a hybrid state/criminal model and a novel data auction strategy. | | **ShinyHunters Salesforce Campaign** | Summer 2025 | Air France-KLM, Cisco, Qantas, Allianz Life, Workday, Pandora | **ShinyHunters / Scattered Spider**; Social engineering / Vishing | Large-scale, successful campaign against a major SaaS platform, highlighting third-party and human-factor risks. | | **Change Healthcare Breach** | Feb 2025 | Change Healthcare (UnitedHealth Group), U.S. Healthcare System | **BlackCat (ALPHV)** Ransomware | Breach affecting an estimated **192.7 million** individuals; caused massive, weeks-long disruption to U.S. pharmacy and medical billing services. Exposed systemic risk from a single point of failure in critical infrastructure. | ## The Shifting Regulatory and Policy Landscape Governments and regulators worldwide are responding to the heightened threat environment with a wave of new, more stringent compliance mandates. ### 4.1. Global Regulatory Intensification - **European Union:** - **NIS2 Directive:** Enforcement ramps up in 2025, imposing strict cybersecurity, supply chain risk management, and 24-hour incident notification requirements on a wide range of \"essential\" and \"important\" entities, with personal liability for management. - **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA):** Becomes fully applicable in January 2025, establishing a comprehensive ICT risk management framework for the entire EU financial sector. - **United States (Federal):** - **SEC Disclosure Rule:** Now in full effect, requiring public companies to disclose material cybersecurity incidents within four business days. - **CIRCIA:** Final rules are expected in late 2025, which will mandate critical infrastructure operators to report significant cyber incidents to CISA within 72 hours and ransomware payments within 24 hours. - **HIPAA Security Rule Update:** A proposed update is expected to make previously \"addressable\" controls—including **MFA, encryption, and network segmentation**—mandatory for all healthcare entities. ### 4.2. U.S. Policy and Legislative Changes A new executive order issued on June 6, 2025, amended federal cybersecurity policy, primarily impacting government contractors. The order rolled back requirements for \"secure software development attestations\" and narrowed the scope of cyber sanctions to apply only to foreign persons. However, it preserved key initiatives like the FCC's **U.S. Cyber Trust Mark** program for IoT device security and maintained the assessment of China as the nation's primary cyber threat. ### 4.3. The Role of Cyber Insurance The cyber insurance market continues to mature, with the global premium volume projected to reach **$16.3 billion** in 2025 and more than double by 2030. While a significant protection gap remains, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), insurers are increasingly driving security maturity by mandating specific controls, such as MFA, as a prerequisite for coverage. ## Strategic Outlook and Recommendations Navigating the 2025 threat landscape requires a strategic shift towards proactive, integrated, and intelligence-driven cybersecurity. 1. **Accelerate Zero Trust Adoption:** A Zero Trust architecture—which assumes no implicit trust and continuously validates every stage of digital interaction—is no longer optional. This requires comprehensive implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA), the principle of least privilege, and micro-segmentation to contain threats and limit lateral movement. 2. **Enhance Supply Chain & Third-Party Risk Management:** Given the prevalence of attacks via third parties, organizations must move beyond questionnaires to continuous monitoring and technical validation of their partners' security postures. Cybersecurity requirements must be embedded in contracts. 3. **Develop a Robust AI Security and Governance Program:** Organizations must establish formal governance frameworks (e.g., NIST AI RMF) to manage the risks of \"shadow AI\" and secure models against unique threats like data poisoning and evasion. AI deployment must be treated with the same security rigor as any other critical technology. 4. **Strengthen Incident Response and Readiness:** With mandatory disclosure timelines shrinking, organizations must have comprehensive, well-tested Incident Response Plans. Regular tabletop exercises and simulations involving technical, legal, and executive teams are critical to ensure a coordinated and compliant response. 5. **Prioritize Foundational Hygiene:** Amidst advanced threats, mastering the fundamentals remains paramount. This includes rigorous asset management, continuous vulnerability scanning, timely patching, secure configuration management, and comprehensive network logging and monitoring. These basics are the most effective defense against both opportunistic criminals and sophisticated state actors. ## Read more [**FBI Strikes Major Blow Against Global Cybercrime: BreachForums Seizure Disrupts Elite Hacking Network** \\ \\ International law enforcement operation dismantles marketplace used by ShinyHunters, Baphomet, and IntelBroker amid massive Salesforce extortion campaign\\ October 2025 — In a coordinated international law enforcement operation, the FBI and French authorities have seized control of BreachForums, one of the world's most notorious cybercrime marketplaces, dealing a significant blow](https://breached.company/fbi-strikes-major-blow-against-global-cybercrime-breachforums-seizure-disrupts-elite-hacking-network/)[**Spain Dismantles Major Banking Phishing Network: The Fall of the GXC Team** \\ \\ Digital Nomad Behind Multi-Million Dollar Credential Theft Operation Arrested\\ Spain's Civil Guard has successfully dismantled one of the most sophisticated phishing operations in the Spanish-speaking world, arresting the 25-year-old Brazilian mastermind behind the GXC Team and disrupting a Crime-as-a-Service empire that facilitated millions of dollars in theft across](https://breached.company/spain-dismantles-major-banking-phishing-network-the-fall-of-the-gxc-team/)[**Major Data Breach Hits Online Casinos Through Third-Party CRM Provider Fast Track** \\ \\ October 2025 — The online gambling industry is grappling with a significant cybersecurity incident after Fast Track, a prominent Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software provider serving the iGaming sector, confirmed that two of its casino clients were compromised in what the company describes as a \"highly sophisticated cyberattack.\"\\ The](https://breached.company/major-data-breach-hits-online-casinos-through-third-party-crm-provider-fast-track/)[**Qantas Data Breach: 5 Million Customer Records Leaked as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Escalate Global Extortion Campaign** \\ \\ Major Airline Falls Victim to Sophisticated Cybercrime Coalition in Year-Long Supply Chain Attack\\ Australia's flagship carrier Qantas Airways has become the latest high-profile victim of an aggressive extortion campaign orchestrated by Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, a notorious cybercriminal coalition that has targeted dozens of Fortune 500 companies in what](https://breached.company/qantas-data-breach-5-million-customer-records-leaked-as-scattered-lapsus-hunters-escalate-global-extortion-campaign/)",

    "full_text": "# India's Geographic Vulnerability to Climate Change Industry Updates 17 mins September 25, 2024 Manasvi Patel ## **World Environmental Health Day 2024** World Environmental Health Day 2024 focuses on the theme \"Environmental Health: Creating Resilient Communities through Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation.\" This theme underscores the critical need to enhance community resilience in the face of climate-related disasters, which have become increasingly frequent and severe due to global warming. By emphasizing disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation, this year's theme calls for integrated approaches that not only protect public health but also ensure sustainable development. India's unique geography and climate make it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. With 27 out of 29 states and 7 union territories susceptible to natural hazards like floods, cyclones, droughts, and earthquakes, the country faces an uphill battle against the devastating impacts of climate change. As World Environmental Health Day 2024 approaches, it's crucial for India to take bold steps to enhance community resilience and protect its vulnerable populations. ### Geographical Factors Contributing to Disaster Risk India's geographical factors significantly contribute to its disaster risk profile, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The combination of its diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors creates a complex landscape of [vulnerabilities](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf): - [**Earthquakes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.7059oimyb6r3): Approximately 58.6% of India's landmass is susceptible to earthquakes, with the country situated in a seismically active zone due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. - [**Coastal Vulnerability**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.sipw79xc52s): India's coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, exposes it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. - [**Floods**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.af8gn4f1799i) and [**droughts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.xdkivgfc02df): about 40 million hectares (around 12% of the land) are prone to floods and river erosion, while 68% of cultivable land is vulnerable to droughts. - [**Landslides**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.kmor8crhvnf7) and avalanches: The hilly regions are also at risk from landslides and avalanches, further compounding the disaster risk faced by various communities across the nation. #### Seismic Activity India is situated at the convergence of several tectonic plates, making it prime for earthquakes. ~58% of the country’s landmass is classified as being at risk for earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity. This seismic vulnerability is particularly pronounced in regions such as the Himalayan belt, which experiences tremors due to ongoing tectonic activity. ##### The Gujarat (Bhuj) Earthquake (2001) For instance, the [2001 Bhuj earthquake](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bhuj-earthquake-of-2001), which registered a magnitude of 7.7, resulted in over 20,000 deaths and injured more than 150,000 others. The earthquake affected approximately 28 million people, destroyed more than 400,000 buildings, with the telecom building collapsing, Bhuj was isolated from the rest of the state; the most seriously affected was the Kandla port (the busiest port in India) which caters to handling crucial imports of petroleum products, crude oil and chemicals and export of agricultural commodities, with about five of the 10 jetties damaged. Over 10,000 small and medium industrial units had to stop production due to damage to plants, factories, and machinery. The Indian State Department [estimates](https://www.adrc.asia/publications/recovery_reports/Gujarat.pdf) that the earthquake affected, directly or indirectly, 15.9 million people out of 37.8 million. The government estimated the direct economic loss at $1.3 billion, while estimates indicate this could be as high as $5 billion. Following the earthquake, emergency relief operations were launched by both government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs): - [ActionAid India](https://www.actionaidindia.org/emergency/gujarat-earthquake-2001/) mobilized local community-based organizations to provide immediate assistance in the most affected areas, by establishing temporary shelters, distributed food and medical supplies, and set up psycho-social counseling services for survivors. - The government initiated a [comprehensive rehabilitation plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm) that included new building codesto ensure that the structures were designed to be earthquake-resistant; and infrastructure redevelopment of roads, schools, hospitals, and utilities was prioritized. - Emphasizing on community participation in planning and implementing disaster management strategies, village-level committees were formed to enhance local capacity for disaster response. - A [State Disaster Management Plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm#:~:text=Gujarat%20State%20Disaster%20Management%20Authority%20(GSDMA)%2C%20which%20would%20implement%20the%20reconstruction%20and%20rehabilitation%2C%20with%20support%20from%20various%20other%20agencies%20in%20the%20quake%2Dhit%20area.) was created that integrated lessons learned from the earthquake, and focused on risk assessment, early warning systems, and community-based disaster management practices aimed at reducing vulnerability to future seismic events. The resilience-building activities undertaken after the Gujarat earthquake reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate relief with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. These efforts underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in seismically active regions like India #### Coastal Vulnerability India's long coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, makes it highly vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis, [exposing](https://irade.org/Sustainable%20and%20Disaster%20Resilient%20Urban%20DevelopmentFinal%20.pdf) it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. This vulnerability is particularly pronounced in states like Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, which have borne the brunt of devastating cyclones in recent years. ###### Cyclone Fani (2019) Cyclone Fani, which made landfall in Odisha on May 3, 2019, serves as a prime example of the destruction that coastal areas face. The [extremely severe](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/cyclone-fani-damage-loss-and-needs-assessment) cyclonic storm caused extensive damage across 14 districts in Odisha, [affecting](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2019-000041-ind) at least 10 million people in the North-eastern Sates of India. Despite the early evacuation of a million people, the cyclone has severely affected the lives and livelihoods of more than 28 million people across 3 States in India. [Total damage](https://ncds.nic.in/sites/default/files/OEDS3NCDS.pdf) to existing stock of assets has been estimated at over $2.4 billion, whereas the economic losses flowing from the disaster are estimated at nearly ~$1.1 billion. In response to the devastation caused by Cyclone Fani, several resilience-building activities were implemented to enhance disaster preparedness and recovery efforts: - [The Government of Odisha](https://www.unicef.org/media/82111/file/India-Cyclone-Fani-SitRep-12-May-2019.pdf) coordinated one of the largest emergency preparedness exercises, mobilizing over 45,000 volunteers and 100,000 officials to ensure effective communication and evacuation protocols. This effort enabled the successful evacuation of approximately 1.47 million people from low-lying areas before the cyclone made landfall. - The state government constructed hundreds of cyclone shelters along the coast to provide safe refuge during storms, which were stocked with essentials like food and water. - Local stakeholders, NGOs, and civil society organizations collaborated with the government to conduct training programs on disaster preparedness including educating communities about evacuation routes and safety measures The resilience-building activities undertaken after Cyclone Fani reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate response efforts with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. The lessons learned from this cyclone underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in coastal regions like Odisha. #### Flood-Prone Areas Over 40 million hectares (about 12% of India’s land) is [prone to floods and river erosion](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf). The monsoon season often brings heavy rainfall leading to river overflow and flash floods, particularly in states like Assam and Bihar. ##### Assam Floods (2023) Assam, a state in northeastern India, is characterized by its fertile Brahmaputra Valley, which supports a rich agricultural sector. The state’s agriculture is primarily based on rice, tea, and jute, and it benefits from the regular monsoon rains that sustain its crops. The geographical features of Assam, including its river basins and low-lying areas, contribute significantly to its susceptibility to flooding. In 2023, Assam experienced devastating floods that [impacted](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/india-whats-really-behind-assams-worsening-floods) over 2.5 million people. In response to the challenges posed by flooding, particularly following the severe floods in 2023, several resilience-building activities have been undertaken in Assam: - The Assam government allocated Rs 1200 crs in 2023-24 for the [construction and maintenance](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=Infrastructure%20Development%3A%20The%20Assam%20government%20has%20allocated%20Rs%201%2C200%20crore%20for%20the%20construction%20and%20maintenance%20of%20flood%20control%20infrastructure%2C%20including%20embankments%20and%20flood%20barriers%2C%20for%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20period.) of flood control infrastructure, including embarkments and drainage systems and investment aimed to enhance the state's capacity to manage floodwaters effectively and reduce the risk of future inundations. - The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) invested ₹25 crores in developing advanced flood forecasting and early warning systems. These systems provide alerts up to three days in advance, allowing communities to prepare for impending floods and evacuate if necessary. - The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) [covers](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=The%20Pradhan%20Mantri%20Fasal%20Bima%20Yojana%20(PMFBY)%20covers%20around%2056%25%20of%20the%20farmers%20in%20Assam%20as%20of%202023.%20This%20scheme%20provides%20insurance%20coverage%20against%20crop%20losses%20due%20to%20natural%20calamities.) around 56% of farmers in Assam as of 2023, providing insurance against crop losses due to natural calamities. This scheme is crucial for protecting farmers' livelihoods and ensuring financial support during disasters. - A Community-Based Disaster Management project was launched in 2023, aimed at building local capacity for flood management in 100 selected gram panchayats focusing on on empowering communities with knowledge and resources to respond effectively to floods. In 2023, Assam introduced a ' [green budget](https://www.open-contracting.org/2023/09/28/improving-climate-resilience-in-flood-prone-assam-india/)' committing approximately $2 billion towards climate change action and disaster risk reduction, aiming to enhance long-term resilience against climate-related disasters through sustainable development practices. The resilience-building activities implemented in Assam following recent floods reflect a proactive approach to disaster risk reduction. By investing in infrastructure, enhancing early warning systems, promoting community engagement, and introducing innovative financial mechanisms like insurance schemes and green budgets, Assam is working towards building a more resilient agricultural sector capable of withstanding the impacts of flooding. #### Drought and Water Scarcity Drought and water scarcity are significant challenges in India, with [about](https://nidm.gov.in/pdf/trgReports/2021/July/Report_29July2021sk.pdf) 68% of the country's cultivable area vulnerable to these conditions. ##### Rajasthan Drought and Water Scarcity Rajasthan, the largest state in India, faces significant challenges related to water scarcity and drought leading to crop failures and economic distress among farmers. The state has [limited water resources](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/ar/261801490687132806/pdf/113703-WP-Water-Assessment-and-Potential-for-Private-Sector-Interventions-PUBLIC.pdf), with only 1.16% of India's total water supply, making it particularly susceptible to prolonged drought conditions. It's among the most [vulnerable to droughts](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/29/surajpura-rajasthan-india-drought-villagers-farmers-climate#:~:text=ajasthan%2C%20India%E2%80%99s%20largest%20state%2C%20is%20among%20the%20most%20vulnerable%20to%20droughts%2C%20with%2098%25%20of%20its%20250%20village%20blocks%20in%20sectors%20marked%20as%20%E2%80%9Cdark%20zones%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20areas%20with%20dangerously%20low%20groundwater%20levels%20%E2%80%93%20and%20almost%207%25%20of%20the%20land%20uncultivable), with 98% of its 250 village blocks in sectors marked as “dark zones” – areas with dangerously low groundwater levels – and almost 7% of the land uncultivable. In response to the recurring drought conditions, several resilience-building activities have been implemented in Rajasthan: - Rainwater harvesting and water conservation techniques were introduced to mitigate the effects of droughts and were prioritized via traditional techniques such as Anictus, Bairis, and tanks. In 2023, after an [unusually high rainfall](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/climate-opportunity-how-did-rajasthan-harvest-rainwater-after-the-early-monsoon-of-2023--94579) of 588.9 mm (nearly 2X the normal amount) villagers utilized these methods to direct the water into ponds and storage system, providing drinking water [for upto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwXQurAJLKs) 1.5 years in some villages. - The Rajasthan Water Sector Restructuring Project, costing a total of $495 million, of which $345 million is [financed](https://www.ndb.int/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rajasthan-Water-00012.pdf) by the New Development Bank, aimed to rehabilitate the Indira Gandhi Canal System, covering over 990 km of canal systems, reclamation of more than 33,000 km of waterlogged areas, and implementation of micro-irrigation techniques. Government schemes like the [Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana](https://pmksy.gov.in/) (PMKSY) were implemented to focus on enhancing irrigation facilities, along with the introduction of a crop insurance scheme to protect farmers from losses due to drought. Despite these resilience-building efforts, Rajasthan continues to face the challenges posed by recurring droughts. The state's vulnerability is exacerbated by its arid climate, limited water resources, and high dependence on agriculture. Sustained efforts and investments in water management, and agricultural practices are crucial for mitigating the impact of droughts and ensuring food security in the region. #### Topography and Landslides India's diverse topography includes mountainous regions that are particularly vulnerable to landslides and avalanches, especially during the monsoon season. The Himalayan region, along with the Western Ghats, experiences heavy rainfall that can destabilize slopes and trigger landslides. One of the most devastating recent events occurred in Wayanad, Kerala, where a series of landslides on July 30, 2024, resulted in significant loss of life and property. ##### The Wayanad Landslides (2024) On July 30, 2024, Wayanad district in Kerala was struck by catastrophic landslides that resulted from extreme rainfall. [The region](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece) received 572 mm of rainfall within 48 hours leading up to the disaster, causing hillsides to collapse in the villages of Mundakkai and Chooralmala. This resulted in over 336 fatalities, ~397 were injured, and at least 118 missing. The debris flow altered the course of the Iruvanjipuzha River, exacerbating flooding conditions in surrounding areas. The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) [reported](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/86000-sq-metres-of-land-slipped-away-debris-travelled-8-km-along-iruvanjippuzha-river-isro-satellite-images-reveal/articleshow/112231968.cms?from=mdr) that about 86,000 square meters of land had shifted due to the landslide. In response to the Wanayd landslides, several activities were initiated: - A [rescue operation](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece#:~:text=On%20August%201%2C%20Chief%20Minister%20Pinarayi%20Vijayan%20said%20over%209%2C300%20people%20were%20staying%20in%2091%20relief%20camps%20in%20Wayanad%20district.) was mobilized involving the Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and local authorities, over 9,300 people were accommodated in relief camps across the district. - [Experts](https://india.mongabay.com/2024/08/commentary-on-the-trail-of-the-wayanad-landslide/) have called for implementing site-specific land-use policies and improving drainage management to mitigate future risks. Additionally, establishing local landslide early warning systems (LEWS) has been recommended to enhance community preparedness. The Wayanad landslides highlight the urgent need for improved land management practices and disaster preparedness in vulnerable regions of India. By implementing effective resilience-building strategies, including community engagement and infrastructure improvements, it is possible to mitigate the impacts of future landslides and protect lives and livelihoods. India's unique geographical factors significantly contribute to its vulnerability to natural disasters. The country's diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors create a complex landscape of risks, including earthquakes, coastal vulnerability, floods, droughts, landslides, and avalanches. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events due to global warming. To address these challenges, India must adopt a comprehensive approach that integrates disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into its development plans. Building resilient communities requires a multi-faceted strategy that includes strengthening early warning systems, investing in resilient infrastructure, promoting community engagement, and adopting sustainable practices.

Google said on Wednesday that China-linked hackers were breaking into a range of companies to steal sensitive national-security and economic data. Kevin Frayer via Getty Images Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have [feedback](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/contact/). WASHINGTON — Highly sophisticated hackers linked to the Chinese government are breaking into technology companies, software-as-a-service providers and legal-services firms with stealthy malware that has allowed them to quietly steal sensitive data from those companies and their customers, [Google announced on Wednesday](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/brickstorm-espionage-campaign). The hackers have pivoted from service providers to their customers’ networks, searched the emails of specific people inside legal firms and hunted for information about U.S. national security and international trade matters, according to Google. The threat actors have also stolen the source code for widely used enterprise technologies, likely as part of an effort to analyze them for undisclosed vulnerabilities that could power future attacks, Google said. In some breaches of enterprise tech vendors, they have searched the email inboxes of software developers for information about product flaws. [A China-linked group called UNC5221](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ivanti-zero-day-attacks/736932/) is conducting most of the attacks, according to Google, but because different teams often share tools, the tech giant said other China-linked groups are also likely involved. The campaign is active right now, Google cybersecurity experts told reporters on Tuesday during a briefing at the company’s Cyber Defense Summit in Washington. “This is happening in the United States, this is next-level activity, and we're only going to learn more about it over time,” said John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG). Hultquist described the campaign as “a very good intelligence operation” and said the attackers’ movement from major vendors to their customers recalled other supply-chain incidents such as [Russia’s SolarWinds espionage campaign](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/solarwinds-1-year-later-cyber-attack-orion/610990/). “It is them moving upstream where they can pick and choose their targets of interest.” ### **Hiding in the gaps** An alarming element of the campaign, Google said, is the hackers’ use of [a malware backdoor called Brickstorm](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/ivanti-post-exploitation-lateral-movement) that they plant on systems that cannot run endpoint detection and response (EDR) or antivirus software, such as VMware ESXi hypervisors, email security gateways and vulnerability scanners. Evading EDR allows them to hide for far longer than hackers typically can — Google said it has taken victims an average of 393 days to discover the intrusions, a remarkably long “dwell time” that defies recent trends in improved attack detection. Google is releasing a tool that will let companies scan their networks for evidence of Brickstorm, as well as YARA rules that companies can use to search their backups for historical evidence of intrusions. Google experts said the hackers excel at erasing their tracks. Many organizations will “find evidence of historic compromises or active compromises,” said Charles Carmakal, chief technology officer at Google’s Mandiant division. Companies that do see signs of the Brickstorm malware need to conduct a thorough investigation, he added. “This is a very, very advanced adversary.” ### **Patient adversary, long-term ripple effects** The main China-linked group responsible for the intrusions, UNC5221, “is the most prevalent adversary in the United States over the past several years” in terms of the frequency, severity and complexity of their attacks, Carmakal told reporters. UNC5221 hackers are extremely stealthy, Carmakal said, never using infrastructure hosted on the same IP address in more than one attack to avoid creating a recognizable pattern. “It’s very hard to detect them and to investigate them,” he said. The attackers are also patient. In one investigation, Google saw the hackers configure their backdoor to lie dormant for months while the victim investigated signs of an intrusion. “It’s clever, but it also shows they’re in it for the long game,” said Austin Larsen, a principal threat analyst at GTIG. Because most companies haven’t discovered the intrusions until long after their logs from the initial access timeframe are automatically deleted, Google researchers have found it difficult to identify the hackers’ means of initial access. But the company said evidence points to the attackers “compromising perimeter and remote access infrastructure,” including Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs and several other edge devices. UNC5221 has been one of the primary groups [exploiting](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ivanti-zero-day-attacks/736932/) Ivanti [vulnerabilities](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/china-nexus-exploiting-critical-ivanti-vulnerability?e=48754805) over the past two years. Google experts declined to identify any of the victims, including the companies that have been hacked because of supplier breaches, as many of those victims are still remediating the intrusions. The company said it was publicizing the ongoing campaign now because it wanted to learn more about the extent of the attacks and to warn potential victims. The impact of the campaign will continue to resonate “six- to twelve- to eighteen- to twenty-four months from now,” Carmakal said, “because over that time, there will be new things that will come out \\[and\\] there will be new victims that disclose \\[breaches\\].” - [purchase licensing rights](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/selfservice/article-licensing/submit/?newspostUrl=https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/china-espionage-supply-chain-cyberattack-backdoor-malware/760917/) Filed Under:[Breaches,](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/topic/breaches/)[Cyberattacks,](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/topic/cyberattacks/)[Threats](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/topic/threats/) ### Cybersecurity Dive news delivered to your inbox Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Email: - Select user consent:By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our [Terms of Use](https://www.informatechtarget.com/terms-of-use/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.informatechtarget.com/privacy-policy/).

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively. This is despite widespread condemnation from independent human rights bodies and refrains from the judiciary.[28](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Karan Thapar, ‘UN Special Rapporteurs Condemn Home Demolitions in India, See Collective Punishment of Muslims,’ The Wire, 18 June 2022](https://thewire.in/rights/un-special-rapporteurs-condemn-home-demolitions-in-india-see-collective-punishment-of-muslims); [Outlook, ‘Supreme Court Grills UP Government On “Bulldozer Action” In House Demolitions,’ 27 July 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/supreme-court-grills-up-government-on-bulldozer-action-in-house-demolitions-news-306157); [Anwesha Mitra, ‘“Ethnic cleansing” by state?

Ashley, ‘How the Spectre of Hindutva Captured Politics in Kerala,’ The Wire, 30 October 2020](https://thewire.in/politics/kerala-elections-hindutva-muslims) The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

Due to its geographical location, seismic risk zone and intertropical convergence point, the Indian subcontinent also faces recurring atmospheric phenomena: heavy monsoon rains, floods, episodes of high heat, drought, etc. In addition, the high population density in risk areas further aggravates the situation. The number of human casualties continues to rise, from 1 674 deaths in 2015 to 2 045 in 2019. According to the report of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the total number of people who died between 2 000 and 2 019 is 79 732. During the same period, India had reported 321 catastrophic events. It is the third country in the world in terms of the number of [natural disasters](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/natural-disasters-in-2021), behind China and the United States. According to the same report, India has suffered nearly 80 billion USD in economic losses in 20 years. ## Breakdown of natural disasters in India per type of event and nature of losses | Natural disasters | Material loss | Human loss | | --- | --- | --- | | **Floods** | 52% | 63% | 32% | | **Hurricanes** | 30% | 19% | 32% | | **Landslides** | 10% | - | 2% | | **Earthquakes** | 5% | 10% | 33% | | **Droughts** | 3% | 5% | 1% | | Total | 100% | 100% | 100% | **Source :** World Bank Some of the most frequent disasters include : **Floods** After China, India is the second country hardest hit by floods with no less than 17 of such events annually, affecting 345 million Indians. This scourge has caused a significant number of casualties and major economic damage to infrastructure, property, livelihoods and crops. Heavy monsoon rains in the eastern part of the country often cause the Brahmaputra River to overflow, with disastrous consequences. According to the 2019 Global Climate Risk Index report, floods account for 52% of the total calamities affecting India, claiming 63% of the material damage and 32% of the human losses reported as natural disasters. On an annual average, 7.500.000 hectares are flooded, and 1.600 lives are lost. **Earthquakes** The probability of an earthquake is high in India, with nearly 60% of the territory being classified as a moderate to severe seismic risk zone. According to seismologists, the Himalayas, one of the regions most exposed to earthquakes, should one day suffer a mega-shock caused by the pressure accumulated in the subsoil of the Himalayan arc. The last earthquake to date occurred in 2015. With a magnitude of 7.8, the earthquake killed 9 000 people and injured more than 20 000 others. More than 600 000 homes were also destroyed by the tremor. **Cyclones** Located in the intertropical convergence zone, the Indian subcontinent is one of the regions most affected by cyclones. Its coastline stretching over more than 8 000 kilometers accounts for nearly 10% of the world's tropical cyclones, the majority of which emerge over the Bay of Bengal and strike the east coast of India. On average, six to eight depressions form each year, two or three of which turn into tropical cyclones. A major cyclone (category 3 or more) develops every two years. In May 2020, [Cyclone Amphan](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/cyclone-amphan-15-billion-usd-of-economic-losses-in-south-asia), devastated India and Bangladesh, killing 84 people and devastating the coastal areas of both countries. It was the most powerful cyclone to hit the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 cyclone that killed 10 000 people in Odisha State (northeast India). **Heat waves and droughts** Extreme temperatures and resulting weather conditions significantly affect the health of residents and the agricultural sector. With global warming, these episodes of intense heat, more than 50 degrees, are becoming increasingly frequent. According to Indian authorities, in the last four years the country has reported no less than 4 620 deaths caused by heat waves which generally occur between March and June. The last event of this kind occurred in June 2019, claiming the lives of 50 people in 24 hours. Over the past 20 years, India has also sustained the two most severe droughts in the world. They took place in 2002 and 2015 and affected 300 and 330 million Indians, respectively. Despite the affordability of coverage and the intensity and frequency of natural events, the penetration rate of natural catastrophe insurance in India is almost nil, with less than 1% of the population contracting an insurance policy for this type of risk. For several years, the authorities have been planning to set up a national pool dedicated to natural disasters, a structure struggling to see the light of day. ## List of major natural disasters that have occurred over the last 20 years in India | Date | Place | Nature of the event | Economic losses | Insured losses | Number of fatalities | Number of affected persons | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | (in billion USD) | | **May 2020** | West Bengal | Hurricane Amphan | 13.5 | ND | 103 | 500 000 homeless | | **August 2018** | Kerala | Floods | 3.52 | 0.37 | 504 | 223 139 homeless | | **November 2015** | Chennai (Tamil Nadu) | Floods | 2.37 | 0.98 | 289 | -

Credit: FOTOGRIN - shutterstock.com A Chinese state-sponsored hacker group called RedNovember has conducted a global espionage campaign targeting critical infrastructure between June 2024 and July 2025, compromising defense contractors, government agencies, and major corporations while exploiting vulnerabilities faster than organizations could deploy security patches. The attacks included breaches of at least two US defense contractors and more than 30 Panamanian government agencies as part of a systematic targeting across the US, Europe, Asia, and South America, according to cybersecurity firm [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/rednovember-targets-government-defense-and-technology-organizations). The threat group deployed the Go-based Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike, and SparkRAT to maintain persistent network access after exploiting flaws in enterprise appliances, researchers said in the report. “The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms,” the report added. Recorded Future’s Insikt Group had previously tracked the activity under the designation TAG-100 before attributing it to Chinese state-sponsored operations. Microsoft also tracks overlapping activity from this group as Storm-2077. ## Systematic exploitation of enterprise network devices RedNovember systematically targeted internet-facing appliances that form the backbone of enterprise network security, successfully compromising SonicWall VPN devices, Ivanti Connect Secure appliances, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, F5 BIG-IP systems, Sophos SSL VPN products, and Fortinet FortiGate firewalls, researchers found. The hackers exploited both recently disclosed vulnerabilities and older flaws that organizations had failed to patch. RedNovember compromised two US defense contractors in April 2025 using CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti appliances – flaws for which patches had been available since January 2024, the report said. A European engine manufacturer that produces aerospace components was breached through its SonicWall VPN device, while multiple law firms fell victim through compromised network appliances, researchers documented. ## 72-hour vulnerability exploitation window RedNovember demonstrated the ability to weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities faster than most organizations could deploy patches, researchers found. When researchers published proof-of-concept code for Check Point VPN vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 on [May 30, 2024](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/), RedNovember was attacking vulnerable systems by June 3. That campaign hit at least 60 organizations across Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the United States within four days, according to the report. Similar patterns emerged with Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, with RedNovember consistently exploiting disclosed vulnerabilities within 72 hours of public exploit code availability, the research showed. ## Open-source tools masked attribution Rather than developing custom malware, RedNovember relied heavily on publicly available tools, including the Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework, and SparkRAT remote access tool, all written in the Go programming language, researchers found. The hackers used variants of the LESLIELOADER tool to deploy SparkRAT on compromised systems, with samples first detected in March 2024, according to the analysis. RedNovember also leveraged legitimate services, including vulnerability scanning tools like PortSwigger’s Burp Suite and VPN services, including ExpressVPN and Cloudflare’s Warp, to manage their infrastructure. “RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution,” researchers explained in the report. ## Global targeting across multiple sectors The group heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, while also conducting surveillance of government agencies across Panama, and targeting entities in Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, the report said. The hackers maintained persistent access to compromised networks for months, with some intrusions lasting from July 2024 through March 2025, according to the research. A Taiwanese IT company remained compromised throughout this period, with researchers tracking communications to Pantegana command-and-control servers. The hacker group also targeted organizations handling sensitive business negotiations, successfully compromising an American law firm involved in debt restructuring for a Chinese company and attempting to breach a major US newspaper, the report found. ## Coordinated timing with geopolitical events Several RedNovember campaigns coincided with significant geopolitical developments, researchers observed. The systematic surveillance of more than 30 Panamanian government agencies occurred just weeks after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an expanded partnership to counter Chinese influence in the canal zone. The targeting of Taiwan facilities, which house both military installations and semiconductor research operations, coincided with Chinese military exercises involving 90 warships around the island in December 2024, the report noted. “The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China,” the researchers wrote. The systematic targeting of internet-facing appliances across multiple vendor platforms indicated that organizations need enhanced monitoring and rapid patch deployment capabilities for network infrastructure devices, the report suggested. RedNovember “will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release,” researchers added in the report.

These states also face heightened risks: - **Gujarat:** Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. - **Maharashtra:** Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. - **Tamil Nadu:** Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. ## **Earthquake Risks** - Urban centres like **Delhi** and **Ahmedabad** face significant earthquake hazards. - A major earthquake in the **Himalayas** or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** in Gujarat. ## **Challenges in Resilience and Insurance** - Despite the scale of economic losses, **underinsurance** remains a critical issue: - **Protection Gaps:** Over **90%** of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. - **Costliest Flood Events:** - **Mumbai floods (2005):** Losses of **$5.3 billion** (2024 prices) - **Chennai floods (2015):** Losses of **$6.6 billion** (2024 prices) ## **Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach** - Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: - **Hotspot Identification:** - Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. - Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. - **Risk Assessment:** - Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. - Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. - **Reinsurance Solutions:** - Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. - Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. ## **Conclusion** - India's rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. - The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. - By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. * * * ### **Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods?** Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. ### **Q2. When was NDMA constituted?** In December 2005, the Government of India enacted the Disaster Management Act, which envisaged the creation of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers. **Source :** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-economic-losses-natural-catastrophes-9779008/) * * * ​ ​ ​ Submit * * * ![logo](https://www.vajiramandravi.com/_next/static/media/badge_logo.5fb7c7f1.svg) © 2025 Vajiram & Ravi.

The Naxal insurgency in India originated in a 1967 uprising in West Bengal by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Most of the modern Maoist groups evolved from splinter groups of CPI- Marxist. Two of those splinter groups united in 2004 to form CPI-Maoist, the primary force in today’s conflict. CPI-Maoist and all other Naxal groups are designated as terrorist organizations. The conflict is concentrated the Eastern part of the country, particularly an area known as the Red Corridor. As of 2017, 104 districts in 13 states are affected by Naxal violence, down from a 2009 high of 195 districts in 16 states. Under India’s Constitution, maintenance of public order is the responsibility of States. The affected States have approached the insurgency with a mixture of policies including negotiation, development programs, and security programs. The Center government has also instituted programs to assist affected states, primarily through funding State programs.

The most notorious civil struggle has been the conflict with Kashmir insurgents, a border conflict between India and Pakistan that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The group was inspired by the agrarian revolution ideology as a means to achieve equality. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. The Naxalites are considered far-left radical communists and are declared a terrorist group under Indian law. In this report we will look into the Maoist movement in India, starting with its history. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group’s success and the global geopolitical consequences. **[View the full report](https://www.confluenceinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/weekly_geopolitical_report_10_28_2013.pdf)** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors.

Worries about the scope of cyber espionage and the damage it can do are rising as some countries become more and more ambitious in stealing information apart from manipulating data and automated control to paralyse networks. Targets include energy grids, which European Parliament reports describe as an attack to “prevent users from using data or services”. This would mean power outages and massive chaos resulting in huge financial losses and equipment failures. Indian authorities know it only too well that American and European governments are not the only targets of nation-state hackers, cyber ninjas or groups acting at the behest of governments to snoop on other nations as part of new strategies to stay ahead of the spying game. After recent bouts of cyberattacks, multiple agencies in the West, including the US, came out with a joint statement, assessing that the extent of threat was higher than what was earlier perceived. Perkins Coie, which specialises in cybersecurity litigation besides other areas, says, “Multiple agencies of the US government and other governments have concluded that the cyber threat presented by the People’s Republic of China \\[PRC\\], specifically actors attributed to Salt Typhoon, is substantially greater than previously reported.” A joint statement by multiple agencies said that PRC’s state-sponsored cyber threat actors are targeting networks globally, including, but not limited to, telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging and military infrastructure networks. “While these actors focus on large backbone routers of major telecommunications providers, as well as provider edge and customer-edge routers, they also leverage compromised devices and trusted connections to pivot into other networks. Theseactors often modify routers to maintain persistent, long-term access to networks. This activity partially overlaps with cyber threat actor reporting by the cybersecurity industry—commonly referred to as Salt Typhoon, OPERATOR PANDA, RedMike, UNC5807 and GhostEmperor, among others.” In an op-ed for the _Washington Post_, Pamela K Isom of the American Security Project wrote that the Salt Typhoon attacks highlight the urgent need for systemic change in how telecommunications providers approach cybersecurity. “Government and industry leaders must be proactive and prioritise threat intelligence to improve defences before incidents occur. This requires proactive threat intelligence sharing. Encouraging an exchange between federal agencies and industry peers on actionable intelligence about emerging threats before incidents occur would help secure our country against state-sponsored hackers. Policymakers should establish programs that promote threat sharing and collaboration between the government and the private sector.” What are the lessons to learn from all this chaos in the West for India, a neighbour who has been the target of suspected Chinese-sponsored hackers for far too long? > Amazon shut down its AI lab and several others scaled down operations in China, fearing espionage by targeting vulnerabilities in their systems to gain access to their networks After all, in the recent hacking spree, according to reports in Bloomberg and the _Guardian_ quoting highly placed sources, the victims of the attack include the US agency charged with overseeing nuclear weapons, the National Nuclear Security Administration. Microsoft said it had observed three groups—the Chinese state-backed Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon, and Storm-2603, which is believed to be China-based—using “newly disclosed security vulnerabilities” to target internet-facing servers hosting the platform, according to a recent _Guardian_ report, as updates from years-long attacks ferret out names of newer victims, taking the toll higher than earlier expected. It was therefore no coincidence that Amazon shut down its Shanghai AI research lab; McKinsey stopped taking up generative AI-related work amid geopolitical tensions in China, and several other companies scaled down operations in that country, fearing espionage by targeting vulnerabilities in the system to gain access to their networks. As stated earlier, TTPs are often talked about by analysts who are close to the matter and are looking at what went wrong in terms of cyber defence and offensive capabilities in their respective units. Tactics explains the “why” of a cyber-attack while techniques the “how”. Procedures are specific actions taken to implement techniques, or “what” the attack was at a granular level. Mumbai-based AI expert and cybercrime investigator Ritesh Bhatia, founder of V4WEB Cybersecurity, tells _Open_ that the recent Chinese cyber intrusions into US security and political establishments highlight three hard lessons. “First, criticalinfrastructure and government networks will always be prime targets for nation-states and no sector is off-limits. Second, even highly resourced nations like the US can be compromised through supply-chain attacks and zero-day exploits, showing that perimeter defence alone is insufficient. Third, geopolitical rivalries are increasingly being fought in cyberspace, where attribution is murky and consequences are long-term.” He adds, “For affected countries, the key takeaway is to shift from a posture of defence to one of resilience that includes continuous monitoring, cyber-threat intelligence sharing, and building international coalitions to deter such actors.” Cyber experts have often talked about why countries fail to anticipate such attacks which, as of now, are synonymous with prolonged espionage. That also means access to personal data of each citizen of a country because of the heightened nature of connectivity and digitalisation. But not much headway has been made by individual countries, including India, which trains cyber commandos at a young age to boost its cyber-offensive capacities. Simply put, the threat of nation-state cyber criminals is on the rise and, in sharp contrast with traditional cyber attackers, their motives often border on warfare. A World Economic Forum report has underscored the challenges ahead: “The rise of generative AI has significantly increased the scale and sophistication of cybercrime, particularly identity theft and fraud. Global cybercrime is expected to cost $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion in 2015, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. To put it in perspective, if annual cybercrime were a country, it would have the third-largest gross domestic product \\[GDP\\] worldwide.” In the 2025 Armis Cyberwarfare Report, in which the firm surveyed more than 1,800 global IT decision-makers, a similar share (73 per cent) added that they feared that nation-state hackers’ AI capabilities could enable future sophisticated cyber attacks. Bhatia notes, “Most nations fail to anticipate vulnerabilities because of two reasons: complacency and complexity. Legacy systems, bureaucratic delays, and lack of proactive red-teaming leave blind spots. Unfortunately, it often takes a breach for leadership to realise that the weakest link in the chain can cause the biggest damage. Cyber resilience requires foresight, not hindsight.” He feels that India has made decent progress in cyber defence, with CERT-In, NCIIPC (National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre) and dedicated cyber command units working actively. However, in terms of offensive capabilities, countries like the US, China, Russia, and Israel are far ahead. India has the talent pool but what we need is sharper coordination, faster adoption of indigenous tools, government support and stronger private-public partnerships to scale our cyber power.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah unveils the logo of the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre, New Delhi, September 11, 2024 In fact, most countries, especially those with an edge in cyber capabilities, hire young people in order to combat threats and protect themselves by launching pre-emptive offensive attacks. _Open_ had written about the Modi government’s plans earlier. While India has successfully withstood cyber attacks from Pakistan during and after _Operation Sindoor_, threats from elsewhere may not necessarily arise in the same way. Many sectors, including India’s education sector, are increasingly being targeted for cyber attacks, according to various reports. According to a report in _The Hindu_, organisations in India witnessed 3,237 cyber attacks per week on average in the month of August 2025 with education being the top target, followed by government and consumer goods and services segments, reported CheckPoint Research, the threat intelligence arm of Check Point, a Tel Aviv-based cyber security solutions firm. For his part, Bhatia agrees, “Cybersecurity is a young person’s game and their curiosity, adaptability, and raw coding skills matter as much as experience. Countries like Israel start spotting and training talent during high school, channelling them into elite units like Unit 8200. In India, we are slowly catching up through initiatives such as university-level ethical hacking competitions. But we need to institutionalise these efforts at scale, starting with school-level programmes, if we want to create a pipeline of cyber warriors for the future.” Meanwhile, a paper authored by Joe Devanny and Arthur PB Laudrain for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace outlines the opportunities and challenges for India on this front. “Given the strength of its digital economy and innovation, and its potential for further growth in connectivity, digital inclusion, and workforce development, India has considerable latent cyber power. There are, however, significant obstacles to converting latent into actual power—and indeed in orchestrating its effective use. Future developments should focus principally on investment in and improved coordination of domestic cybersecurity, resilience, and cyber defence.” The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) has acknowledged the need to groom cyber commandos, and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is working with the states to create special cells of such cyber warriors. Yet, considering the pace and extent of damage that nation-state cyber actors can cause, a swifter implementation of plans is in order. - [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook](https://ullekhnp.com/2025/09/20/the-rage-of-the-nation-state-hacker/?share=facebook) - [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X](https://ullekhnp.com/2025/09/20/the-rage-of-the-nation-state-hacker/?share=twitter) - [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)WhatsApp](https://ullekhnp.com/2025/09/20/the-rage-of-the-nation-state-hacker/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) - [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn](https://ullekhnp.com/2025/09/20/the-rage-of-the-nation-state-hacker/?share=linkedin) - [More](https://ullekhnp.com/ullekhnp.com) - [Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Email](mailto://ullekhnp.com?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20The%20Rage%20of%20the%20Nation-State%20Hacker&body=https%3A%2F%2Fullekhnp.com%2F2025%2F09%2F20%2Fthe-rage-of-the-nation-state-hacker%2F&share=email) - [Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Pocket](https://ullekhnp.com/2025/09/20/the-rage-of-the-nation-state-hacker/?share=pocket) LikeLoading... ### _Related_ ### Leave a comment [Cancel reply](https://ullekhnp.com/2025/09/20/the-rage-of-the-nation-state-hacker/\\#respond) Δ Privacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.

[Sign up](https://subscribe.bylinetimes.com/newsletter-signup/) While the world focuses on the spectacle of India carrying out [its biggest national election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Indian_general_election) – with 960 million Indian citizens eligible to vote out of a population of 1.4 billion – serious unrest continues to haunt the state of Manipur. For the last five months, _Byline Times_ has continued to receive detailed weekly updates from frontline activists in the northeastern state. These catalogue ongoing communal violence between different ethnic and religious groups that is subverting social and political life in the remote region. Building on the conflict recounted in a [previous _Byline Times_ report](https://bylinetimes.com/2023/10/19/state-complicity-and-ethnic-cleansing-in-india/), this unrest has now been taking place for a year. The situation highlights a distinct disconnect between the apparent virtues of India as the world’s largest [democracy](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/) and the ongoing restriction of human rights in the country. December 2023 witnessed the suspension of [146 members of the Indian Parliament](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/19/why-141-india-opposition-mps-suspended-from-parliament) (100 from the Lower House and 46 from the Upper House). The suspensions were denounced as the [“murder of democracy”](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/murder-of-democracy-congress-after-14-opposition-mps-suspended-4673809) by the main opposition party – the Indian National Congress (INC) – and as a way to pass draconian [legislation](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/12/03/government-by-talking-shop-hardly-heres-just-some-of-the-major-reforms-keir-starmer-has-introduced-so-far/) across India.

These non-Hindu tribal groups include the Kuki, Zomi, Mizo and Chin, which are more widely termed as the [Zo people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo_people). Activists maintain that, courtesy of their links to the ruling state [ministers](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/11/19/amid-the-media-noise-about-cronyism-keir-starmer-is-quietly-reforming-political-standards-for-the-better/) and sympathetic [police](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/11/only-a-tiny-fraction-of-child-abuse-allegations-made-by-victims-are-leading-to-charges/) groupings, the Meitei are being aided by official connivance in their carrying out of “ethnic pogroms”. Zo leaders note their [discrimination](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/09/police-race-action-plan-slammed/) by state officials and processes of “selective justice”, whereby Zo are presented as “anti-nationals” and are much more likely to be prosecuted. The [Supreme Court’s assertion that Manipur has witnessed a “total breakdown of law and order”](https://www.timesnownews.com/india/manipur-violence-case-supreme-court-summons-manipur-dgp-questions-lapses-article-102309550), even with 40,000 security personnel on the ground, compounds this favouritism. Such accusations come in the midst of continuing violence perpetrated by Meitei tribals and [well-armed militias, such as the Arambai Tenggol](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/explained-who-are-meitei-radical-group-arambai-tenggol-and-why-did-they-summon-manipur-lawmakers) and [Meitei Leepun](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/manipur-violence-it-is-a-global-war-says-meitei-leepun-leader-pramot-singh-interview/article67004485.ece).

Villages have also faced attacks by [Meitei militias using automatic weapons and mortars](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/violence-continues-in-manipur-mortars-and-automatic-weapons-used/article67253119.ece). Often these incidents have been photographed and filmed, before being shared on social [media](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/10/21/telegraph-misled-readers-on-climate-change-impact-rules-press-watchdog-in-rare-slap-down/) platforms to incite violence and intimidate targeted tribals. This unrest has been intensive and systematic over the last 12 months and by October 2023 more than 70,000 people (including 12,000 children) had been displaced. It has been heightened by [periodic internet bans](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/manipur-violence-internet-services-restored-border-areas-exception-meiteis-kukis-2471548-2023-12-04) and the use of fake news by Meitei media groups, as well as utilising large [protest](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/12/when-peaceful-protesters-face-harsher-sentences-than-violent-racists-something-has-to-give/) mobs to demand the removal of non-Meitei public officials.

Related to these phenomena is the continued religious persecution of the Christian-majority Zo by the Hindu-majority Meitei, which has included [the burning of 357 churches](https://www.opendoors.org.au/frontline-faith/understanding-manipur-what-led-to-the-recent-violence-against-christians-in-india/) since May. Evidence has also surfaced of Zo graves being desecrated. Such claims come despite the existence of regional [Meitei drug gangs](https://thewire.in/security/manipur-violence-poppy-national-security-golden-triangle) and the increased interception by Indian security forces of armed Meitei militia members infiltrating India across the Myanmar border. This discrimination has raised fears that the communal violence aims to force non-Meitei tribals from their land, in order [to monopolise oil, gas and mineral reserves](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/at-the-core-of-manipurs-ethnic-strife-is-fight-over-tribal-land-rights) (such as uranium and platinum). The normalization of violence and population displacement accentuates such a threat. State complicity also plays a role, with Meitei leaders having linkages to big mining corporations eager to exploit such valuable natural commodities. In some areas, power supplies to non-Meitei villages have been sabotaged, leaving them without power or telecommunications for days. Elsewhere, non-Meitei villages have been blockaded by militias, preventing the delivery of essential food and commodities. Signalling a further escalation, in January 2024, [the central Manipur government conceded security control of Imphal to the Arambai Tenggol](https://thediplomat.com/2024/01/abject-surrender-of-the-state-to-armed-militia-in-indias-manipur/). This gave the Meitei militia dominance over security arrangements in Manipur’s capital and – given the militia’s ongoing violence – is an ugly portent for the local non-Meitei population. Meitei legislators were reportedly forced to declare allegiance to the Arambai Tenggol. In the months since the Arambai Tenggol took over, Imphal has seen a rise in armed intimidation, extortion, the illegal occupation of property, and even the [use of improvised explosive devices](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/one-dead-one-injured-blast-indias-manipur-state-2024-02-24/), or IEDs.

Other groups are also recasting the anniversary of the day that Manipur joined the Indian Union on 21 September 1949 as now being a “Black Day” of protest. Additional groups have protested calling for an end to gender-based violence and violence against students. Further collectives are demanding the setting up of an independent Zo administration in Manipur. Coupled with these movements are increasing calls for the Zo areas of Manipur to merge with those in the neighbouring state of Mizoram, especially given the ongoing displacement of the Zo. Within this context, the response by the central government in New Delhi continues to be seen as lax and insufficient. Although the troubles in Manipur are receiving greater national coverage, [Prime Minister Narendra Modi has resisted calls to visit the region](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/indian-opposition-walks-out-as-narendra-modi-refuses-to-discuss-manipur-conflict). This comes despite the severe economic and social damage being wrought upon its people, as well as the slow Meitei domination of Manipur’s state bureaucracies. The 2024 [general election](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/08/28/stark-figures-reveal-how-many-londoners-were-turned-away-due-to-voter-id-in-general-election/) may be a factor here, with the BJP seeking to hold the [Inner Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency) (that includes the regional capital Imphal) and possibly gain the [Outer Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency), which it lost to the Naga People’s Front by 73,782 votes in 2019. Moreover, such a blind eye can also potentially be explained by the BJP’s deeper aim to actively assimilate all India’s minorities towards its Hindu majoritarian outlook. Escalating Meitei-instigated violence against Manipur’s tribal groups certainly – and usefully – fits with such a dynamic and appears to be increasingly successful. It also strengthens narratives of India’s Hindu population being threatened by non-Hindus. A BJP victory in the 2024 national [elections](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/) will only hasten such a forced “harmonisation”, with negative consequences for other non-Hindu groups, regions, and states across India. * * * ##### Written by [Chris Ogden](https://bylinetimes.com/author/chrisogden/) * * * ##### This article was filed under [Christianity](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/christianity/), [Democracy](https://bylinetimes.com/category/democracy/), [Hinduism](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/hinduism/), [India](https://bylinetimes.com/category/foreign-affairs/india-foreign-affairs/)",

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

The soaring temperatures have resulted in further pressure on energy supply as people turn to air conditioning to lessen the worst impacts of the heat. The increased demand is straining electricity supply and leading to power outages, with some in India lasting up to 14hrs a day [\\[1\\]](https://www.thebci.org/www.thebci.org#_ftn1). The extreme temperatures in India and Pakistan have now lasted three weeks but are especially notable for their early onset, arriving before the summer months truly begin. The unexpected early arrival of the heat and sudden climb in electricity demand is now causing disruption throughout both countries. **Climate change – a chronic threat** Many have already linked the early arrival of the high temperatures to climate change [\\[2\\]](https://www.thebci.org/www.thebci.org#_ftn2). In The BCI’s Extreme Weather and Climate Change Report 2022, we see that many organizations view severe weather events, such as the heatwave, as acute and manageable through standard Business Continuity practices. For example, in the case of a heatwave resulting in a power outage, organizations can prepare by having an alternative power supply (such as gas-powered generators in the eventuality of an electrical failure) available. But short-term solutions may not be appropriate for a long-term chronic threat, especially for those organizations with higher power demands. Furthermore, as the report finds, organizations are not viewing extreme weather events linked to climate change as a chronic risk. Indeed, as the world reports an increase in severe weather events related to climate change, industries which have large-scale power demands may find themselves particularly vulnerable to repeated stoppages, unless methods to address the chronic threat are put into action as early as possible. For more information on how organizations are addressing climate risk, read the report here: [https://www.thebci.org/resource/bci-extreme-weather---climate-change-report-2022.html](https://www.thebci.org/resource/bci-extreme-weather---climate-change-report-2022.html) **Resulting threats from the Indian and Pakistan heatwave** Another finding of the Extreme Weather report is how, at 42.1%, participants rated supply chain disruption as one of the leading concerns resulting from climate-related events. With regards to the heatwave affecting India and Pakistan, the increased power demand has had another impact on an already-weakened energy supply chain. Since coal is such an important part of both countries’ energy mix, imports of the fuel will have to increase to meet demand. This will be especially important due to reports that India’s coal stocks are low in as many as 108 of its 173 power plants, according to a BBC report [\\[3\\]](https://www.thebci.org/www.thebci.org#_ftn3). As coal prices, amongst other energy sources, are at a high-point as a result of the war in Ukraine, one solution will be to increase domestic production of coal as much as feasibly possible. Still, organizations will be aware of rising energy prices. In addition to this, another threat which could emerge is further damage to the weakened food supply chain, as India’s extensive wheat crops are damaged by the extensive heat and farmers contend with working outside under the sun without methods of cooling down. From all of this, we can this how extreme weather events relating to climate change can pose a threat on multiple fronts and it is simply a matter of when organizations will have to contend with them.

The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about.

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

On May 10, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after a series of retaliatory strikes and cross-border clashes triggered by a deadly militant attack on April 22 in India-administered Kashmir, which New Delhi claims was carried out by an alleged Pakistan-backed militant group. Following the ceasefire, India and Pakistan's military leaders held a phone call on May 12 to discuss de-escalation. Later, on May 30, a senior Pakistani military official stated that the two countries were close to reaching an agreement to reduce troop deployments along the border to pre-conflict levels, though no such drawdown has yet been observed....",

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

Some of the most violent attacks conducted by the Naxalites have been against police transport and freight trains, killing dozens of people at a time. The Naxalites specifically inhabit an area known as the \"Red Corridor,\" which stretches from West Bengal state southwest to Karnataka state. The most violent states in this corridor have been Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Orissa. The region is defined by rolling hills covered in dense forest and has few improved roads, which allows the Naxalites to control access. The dense foliage also protects them from government aircraft.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

Hindu nationalist sentiment in the country is increasingly influencing its politics. (NARINDER NANU/AFP/GettyImages) Editor’s Note: Stratfor is republishing this foundational analysis from March 2016 in light of a recent flare-up of Hindu nationalist violence in India. On June 2, police clashed with armed protesters from the Hindu Netaji sect occupying a park in the city of Mathura. At least 24 people were killed and more than 300 protesters were arrested. The Hindu protesters had held the park for the past two years, demanding that India's parliament disband and that the posts of president and prime minister be abolished. In recent months, a surging wave of Hindu nationalism has challenged India's bedrock philosophy of secular pluralism, touching off a raging national debate about the fundamental nature of the country's political identity. This so-called intolerance debate has pitted traditional pluralism against a more strident, conservative religious-based conception of Indian nationhood that seeks to change the underlying principles the nation was founded upon....

Image: Tata Power. The build-out of India’s power transmission network is lagging behind the country’s rapid growth in renewable energy, leading to project delays and cost increases. That is the conclusion of a report out today from think-tank IEEFA South Asia and market analysts JMK Research, which reveals that over 50GW of renewable energy capacity was stranded across India as of June this year due to transmission constraints. ## Try Premium for just $1 - Full premium access for the first month at only $1 - Converts to an annual rate after 30 days unless cancelled - Cancel anytime during the trial period [Start $1 Trial](https://www.pv-tech.org/invite/L579GzIZSq1k4q2HHP) ### Premium Benefits - Expert industry analysis and interviews - Digital access to PV Tech Power journal - Exclusive event discounts ### Or get the full Premium subscription right away [Get Premium Subscription](https://www.pv-tech.org/grid-constraints-threatening-indias-renewable-energy-targets-report/) ### Or continue reading this article for free [Get Basic (FREE) Subscription](https://www.pv-tech.org/grid-constraints-threatening-indias-renewable-energy-targets-report/) The report said these constraints are limiting the pace at which new capacity can be brought online and undermining India’s ability to reach its clean energy targets. According to the report, the most recent network expansion figures reveal a 42% gap between planned and commissioned transmission lines, with Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) additions at their lowest in a decade. Annual transmission line additions have fallen short of planned levels since 2019, with only 2021 surpassing expectations, the report noted. “In several high-demand corridors, speculative hoarding of transmission capacity by entities without genuine project intent has driven up connectivity prices and delayed access for viable projects,” said the report’s contributing author, Vibhuti Garg, IEEFA’s South Asia director. “Right-of-way issues, extended land acquisition timelines, restrictions on equipment procurement, and multi-agency approvals also contribute to delays,” added Prabhakar Sharma, co-author of the report and a senior consultant at JMK Research. The report highlighted the mismatch between variable generation and grid consumption as part of the problem. While solar generation aligns with the afternoon peak consumption pattern, it tapers off in the evening when demand is high, creating a gap that limits the integration of renewables and leads to the underutilisation of transmission corridors. Energy storage is vital to bridge this gap, the report said. It singled out the state of Rajasthan, where 8GW of renewable energy capacity remains stranded, with nearly half of that curtailed during peak solar hours. Delayed completion of the Associated Transmission System, the dedicated transmission infrastructure linked to new generation projects, along with capacity hoarding and ecological directives, has compounded evacuation challenges, inflated project costs and reduced operational efficiency. IEEFA and JMK said a unified generation-transmission planning framework that aligns timelines and locations for new generation and transmission capacity was a key part of the solution. This would involve a coordinated approach, combining regulatory reform, operational efficiency measures and capital mobilisation. The integration of energy storage systems should also be prioritised in renewable-rich regions to enhance capacity utilisation and reduce curtailment, the report added. Specific measures identified in the report include a single-window clearance system to streamline land, right of way and connectivity approvals, and performance-based incentives and disincentives tied to asset utilisation metrics to encourage timely commissioning and sustained operations. “Without targeted reforms, misalignment between generation commissioning and evacuation infrastructure is likely to continue driving congestion, curtailment, and systemic inefficiencies, ultimately slowing progress towards achieving India’s decarbonisation objectives,” the report concluded.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

    "title": "India-US Trade Rift: Scenarios, Spillovers and Strategic Shifts",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Economics \\| 2 min read \\| September 2025 # India-US Trade Rift: Scenarios, Spillovers and Strategic Shifts As the standoff between the two countries continues, we analyze likely scenarios, macro spillovers, and India's countercyclical and strategic response - Tensions between India and the United States have risen, after the latter imposed a 50% tariff rate - The power balance tilts towards the US, but India also has a large consumer market, provides opportunities for US in defense and energy sectors and acts as a strategic counterweight to China - Higher US tariffs are a near-term growth drag, but they will trigger diversification and further reforms. We expect India’s global value chain integration to be disrupted, rather than derailed by these tariffs Since US President Donald Trump’s imposition of a 50% tariff rate on India (25% reciprocal tariff plus a 25% Russia penalty), the standoff between India and the Unites States has continued. In this article, we look at possible scenarios and medium-term implications in light of these tariffs being implemented. India has maintained a defiant stance on protecting farmers’ interests. Multiple outcomes are possible from here, with different implications. On trade, the US and India have held five rounds of negotiations, where India offered zero tariffs on industrial goods, and agreed to gradually reduce tariffs on US cars, but disagreements emerged over India’s reluctance to open its agriculture (genetically modified crops) and dairy sectors, which are politically important for President Trump. A fundamental misalignment also emerged between the two nations' approaches: India sought a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement, while it appears the Trump administration preferred a quick deal. India's response has been notably resolute across multiple fronts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emphasized unwavering protection of farmers' interests, even at personal cost, and has encouraged citizens to buy goods domestically. Within India, both opposition leaders and business community representatives have rallied behind the government's position, accepting short-term economic pain over perceived international pressure. In our base case, we assume the 25% reciprocal tariff remains in place through FY26, but the 25% Russian penalty is effective only until November. As such, we expect GDP growth at 6.6% y-o-y in FY26, after considering other policy offsets. On the other hand, if both sides dig in their heels, resulting in a continuation of the 50% tariff rate, then we would expect the hit to GDP growth to be 0.8 percentage points on an annualized rate basis. The current account deficit is also likely to deteriorate to around 1.1% of GDP. We see significant spillovers hitting investment and consumption through job losses in export intensive sectors, with further escalation risks through tariffs or non-tariff barriers. With the new tariff structure, the cost differential between India and China has narrowed, and between India and Southeast Asian competitors, it has moved in favor of the latter. This could have various effects on the shape of new supply chains such as the negative impact on textiles, leather and toys, and Indian firms possibly relocating their production to lower tariff countries to retain their US customer base. However, this will merely disrupt global value chain integration for India, not derail it entirely. We expect the government to announce a multi-pronged response, with fiscal and financial support for exporters, focus on export diversification and fast-tracking free trade agreements. More reforms are also likely. Goods and services tax rationalization has already been announced, and we expect further reforms such as FDI liberalization, deregulation, factor market reforms, privatization, and administrative reforms.

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies.

But while it appears Beijing has largely achieved this objective for now, the harsh Himalayan winter could again escalate its standoff with India by challenging China's ability to maintain a presence throughout the disputed territory....

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

Until New Delhi addresses the underlying grievances spurring unrest in Kashmir Valley, its residents will continue to oppose Indian rule. (TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP/Getty Images) Kashmir is known throughout South Asia for its natural beauty, which draws visitors from far and wide. But beneath the region's alluring exterior, deep-seated grievances are beginning to jeopardize its stability. On July 8, Indian security forces killed Burhan Wani, the 22-year-old commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, a militant separatist group that calls for the India-administered portion of the region (Jammu and Kashmir) to join Pakistan. The organization's fighters regularly sustain casualties, but Wani's death set off widespread protests in the state's capital, Srinagar. In an effort to contain the situation, New Delhi temporarily shuttered at least four major Kashmiri newspapers, cut off mobile phone and internet access to the region, and imposed a curfew that has yet to be lifted. These measures have not stopped the demonstrations, however, and clashes between protesters and security forces have left more than 50 dead and 3,000 injured. New Delhi has pointed the finger at...

Tewani [Download Full Report](https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/Green%20Power%20Transmission%20Development%20in%20India%20FV6%20%281%29.pdf) [View Press Release](https://ieefa.org/articles/transmission-expansion-trails-renewable-energy-growth-india) ## Key Findings Over 50GW of renewable energy capacity remains stranded nationwide as of June 2025, leading to project delays and increasing per-unit transmission costs. These constraints limit the pace at which new capacity can be brought online. India’s transition to renewables is limited by the mismatch between variable generation and grid consumption. While solar generation aligns with the afternoon peak consumption pattern, it tapers off in the evening when demand is high. This creates a gap that limits renewable integration and leads to the underutilisation of transmission corridors. Energy storage is vital to bridge this gap. Renewable corridors often operate below their intended capacity; however, some degree of underutilisation is temporary, as it reflects strategic overbuilding to meet future demand growth. Transmission planning needs to move beyond the traditional five-year static cycle to a more adaptive approach that reflects evolving generation patterns and demand growth. India’s power transmission network, one of the largest in the world, spans over 494,000 circuit kilometres (ckm) of lines and 1.33 million megavolt-amperes of transformation capacity, forming a fully synchronised national grid. However, the network struggles to keep up with renewable energy deployment, leading to a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of evacuation infrastructure. This imbalance limits renewable integration and increases the risk of stranded assets and higher delivery costs. The widening gap between planned and actual transmission network expansion is becoming evident. In FY2025, only 8,830ckm of new transmission lines were commissioned against a target of 15,253ckm, reflecting a 42% shortfall, with Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) additions at their lowest in a decade. Alongside this capacity gap, system inefficiencies are emerging, with analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicating that up to 71% of ISTS corridors operate below 30% utilisation, underscoring the mismatch between infrastructure availability and actual power flows. Market distortions further aggravate the situation. In several high-demand corridors, speculative hoarding of transmission capacity by entities without genuine project intent has driven up connectivity prices and delayed access for viable projects. Structural and procedural bottlenecks, including right-of-way (RoW) disputes, prolonged land acquisition processes, restrictions on equipment procurement, and multi-agency approval requirements, add to the delay. Among these, RoW remains one of the most significant barriers to timely transmission development. Similar land acquisition hurdles in the US have also slowed new transmission build-outs. In India, the impact is most visible in Rajasthan, where 8 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity remains stranded, with nearly half curtailed during peak solar hours. Delayed completion of the Associated Transmission System—the dedicated transmission infrastructure linked to new generation projects—along with capacity hoarding and ecological directives mandating underground cabling in Great Indian Bustard habitats, have compounded evacuation challenges, inflated project costs, and reduced operational efficiency. The implications are significant—over 50GW of renewable energy capacity is currently stranded nationwide, increasing per-unit transmission costs, weakening project viability, and deterring private investment. These constraints limit the pace at which new capacity can be brought online and undermine India’s ability to integrate variable renewable energy at scale, risking missed milestones in the country’s clean energy transition. A unified generation-transmission planning framework that aligns timelines and locations for both generation and transmission capacity additions is essential. A single-window clearance system with strict timelines should be implemented to streamline land, RoW, and connectivity approvals. Performance-based incentives and disincentives tied to asset utilisation metrics can encourage timely commissioning and sustained operations. Scaling asset monetisation and public-private partnerships will be essential to unlocking capital for both inter-state and intra-state projects. In parallel, reconductoring of congested corridors and integration of energy storage systems should be prioritised in renewable-rich regions to enhance capacity utilisation and reduce curtailment. A coordinated approach—combining regulatory reform, operational efficiency measures, and capital mobilisation—will be critical to transforming India’s transmission network into a flexible, resilient system capable of supporting high renewable penetration while ensuring cost-effective and reliable power delivery. The recent extension of ISTS charge waivers for storage and the implementation of time block-based General Network Access allocation—which allows power generators to use the transmission network without pre-identifying buyers—are steps in the right direction. Without targeted reforms, misalignment between generation commissioning and evacuation infrastructure is likely to continue driving congestion, curtailment, and systemic inefficiencies, ultimately slowing progress towards achieving India’s decarbonisation objectives. ### Vibhuti Garg Vibhuti Garg is the Director for South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), where she leads efforts to advance sustainable development through strategic policy interventions in energy pricing, subsidy reforms, innovative business models, and market design.

Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Under the new Trump administration, the US imposed tariffs of 10% to 50% on imports from over 80 countries. India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B) 1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems &amp; jewelry, dairy &amp; agriculture, machinery &amp; engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems &amp; jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42% 2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18% 3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion 4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21% 5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP 6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance Washington could start imposing tariffs against a wider...
