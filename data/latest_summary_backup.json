Formed from a 1967 split within the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the insurgency has been responsible for decades of violence throughout eastern and central India’s “Red Corridor.” These loosely affiliated Maoist rebels claim to fight on behalf of the landless poor, virulently opposing the injustice and oppression of the Indian state. In response to attacks on police officers, government officials, and landlords, India has employed an assortment of counterinsurgency strategies that, over the years, have met varied levels of success. As the modern Naxalite movement continues to develop, the Indian government faces new complications related to one of its most destabilizing internal security challenges. Adequately addressing this threat will prove essential in solidifying India’s status as a rising world power, as well as demonstrating its capacity to effectively combat militancy.

So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group’s success and the global geopolitical consequences. **View the full report** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors."

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of domestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime security activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence-sharing and operations.

Over the past decade, India has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy (RE), ranking third behind China and the US in installations and power generation. Power transmission is a critical component of the electricity value chain, and a robust and resilient network is essential for integrating the increasing RE capacity into the grid. The diurnal and seasonal variability of VRE further complicates transmission planning, leading to stranded RE assets and underutilisation of transmission infrastructure. **Obstacles to an efficient power transmission system** Turning the increased planning efforts into actual implementation will require addressing the persistent challenges that hinder the development of green power transmission, like difficulties in land acquisition for right of way, and overseas transmission equipment procurement constraints, among other issues. Moreover, given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, the roadmap must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. Ultimately, a modern and robust transmission network will form the invisible backbone of India’s power sector, one that is flexible, resilient, and fully aligned..."

They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was assaulted and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed Hindutva, the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the..."

The compute infrastructure supporting the digital economy is migrating from traditional IT rooms to industrial-scale data centres, creating a new and concentrated source of load that operates on a different scale than anything the grid has handled before. India can construct utility-scale solar farms in 12 to 24 months (Mohit Bhargava, Senior Advisor to India Energy and Climate Center at UC Berkeley and former CEO of NTPC Green Energy said at a recent conference), which makes the renewable buildout look deceptively simple on paper. The investment exists on paper, but the physical infrastructure lags years behind where it needs to be to support the generation capacity that is either already built or under construction. Reliance has land banks suitable for well over 100 gigawatts of solar capacity, but the ability to connect to the grid is the choke point affecting actual deployment of these projects. Storage is a powerful complement to transmission and flexibility, not a replacement for either, and it cannot by itself solve the problem of evening demand. The country built firm capacity and a long-haul backbone first, then stacked wind and solar behind it once the grid could handle the variability. Texas offers a cautionary mirror on the other end of the spectrum: a torrent of wind and solar capacity, relatively light interconnections between regions, and a price-only..."

    "summary": "ET Bureau NEW DELHI: The power sector is unable to use at least 10% of its capacity due to the choked transmission network in the country, hurting projects of Tata Power, Essar Power, Jindal Power, JSW Energy, CLP, DB Power, MB Power, Emco Energy, GMR and Adhunik Power. Inadequate transmission has kept about 25,000 MW of generation capacity idle, making the problem comparable to the issue of acute fuel scarcity that has hit about 30,000 MW of new capacity, industry executives say. In addition to the inadequate capacity, regulatory authorities impose strict restrictions on the utilisation of existing networks and keep a large amount of transmission capacity idle as a safeguard against grid collapse. “The impact of transmission congestion on the power exchanges has been increasing with each passing year impacting both the volumes as well as the prices. The volume lost is slated to increase further unless adequate measures are adopted to augment transmission capacity in the regions having congested transmission corridors.Constraints in the regional transmission system in south further added to the problem and increased the power deficit there,“ he said. Ashok Khurana, director general of the Association of Power Producers, says restrictions on capacity utilisation of transmission corridors often prevent generation companies from supplying power even after signing long-term power supply agreements. Transmission bottlenecks prevent the supply of power to deficit regions in summer and monsoon seasons, when demand peaks, he said.He also wrote to the regulator saying projects of Tata Power, Essar Power, Jindal Power, JSW..."

When it started The starting point of the incident from the report’s point of view is 12:32:00 (CEST) on 28 April, at which time the voltage of Iberian power system at the 400kV level was below 420kV and no notable oscillation with amplitude higher than 20mHz could have been observed. Between 12:32:00.000 and 12:32:57.000, there was a loss of 208MW identified distributed wind and solar generators in northern and southern Spain, as well as an increase in net load in the distribution grids of approximately 317MW, either due to the disconnection of small embedded generators &lt;1 MW (mainly rooftop PV) or to an actual increase in load or to a combination of both. The next phase of major disconnection events started some milliseconds after 12:32:57 with the tripping of a generation transformer in the region of Granada due to the activation of an over-voltage protection in the 220kV side of a 400/220kV transformer connecting several renewable generation facilities to the transmission grid. This was followed by two sets of trips at 12:33:16.460 and 12:33:16.820, the reasons for which are not known, resulting in an additional loss of around 725MW of PV and thermo-solar facilities connected to two 400 kV transmission substations in the area of Badajoz...."

Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs.

That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how.

Our Vadodara (Baroda) office is ideally situated to support India’s chemicals hub, while our Kolkata office serves as a center of expertise for the metals and mining sector, for both domestic and international customers. While India has made significant progress by scaling its solar and wind infrastructure in the last decade, coal still remains the backbone of India’s power sector – over 70% of electricity generation and a critical source of industrial employment. India’s industrial landscape is anchored by three powerful forces: 1) large Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) with policy influence; 2) powerful family-owned conglomerates like Reliance and Tata with legacy networks, land access and synergistic edge across the value chain; and 3) fast-moving, tech-savvy first generation entrepreneurs or private players backed by domestic and foreign capital.

Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies.

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected....

    "summary": "If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up..."

    "summary": "According to US president Donald Trump, the additional punitive measure has been taken because of India’s imports of Russian oil (of which India is the second-largest buyer) and defence equipment at a time when Russia has frustrated Mr Trump’s attempts to end the war in Ukraine. Since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has supplanted other major sources of oil imports for India, such as Iraq and the US, because of price considerations. The punitive nature of the additional tariff suggests that it is a negotiating tactic from the US to influence the terms of ongoing bilateral trade talks with India. This is also evident in the fact that the US has not yet imposed a similar punitive measure on China, which is the largest importer of discounted Russian crude oil. There is now a risk of increased belligerence in trade talks between India and the US, which would complicate the achievement of a mutually favourable trade deal. If the 50% tariff on India remains in place for the rest of fiscal year 2025/26 (April-March), we believe that it will reduce GDP growth to 5.8%, from our current forecast of 6.2% (under the baseline 25% tariff rate). Three factors will preclude a sharper slowdown in Indian growth: exemptions for certain categories (including steel, aluminium, pharmaceuticals, energy and electronics); the relatively low share of exports in India’s economy (goods exports to the US are equivalent to about 2% of India’s GDP); and recent trade diversification efforts by India.

The 46th ASEAN Summit, convened on May 26, brought together leaders from the ten-member bloc and produced a new five-year strategic plan aimed at deepening economic integration among member states, with goals such as further harmonizing trade standards, enhancing financial integration and promoting sustainable economic practices. Leaders also committed to finalizing an upgraded ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement by October, which aims to further liberalize regional markets and boost intra-ASEAN trade beyond..."

On April 2, the United States announced a new set of tariffs impacting many trading partners, including a 37% tariff on Bangladesh, 30% on Pakistan and 44% on Sri Lanka. While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances. This announcement came as all three countries are engaged in International Monetary Fund programs and face economic challenges, including high debt burdens and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. ..."
