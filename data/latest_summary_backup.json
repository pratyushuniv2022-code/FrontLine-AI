Represented by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and the Asian Center for Human Rights, and think tanks such as the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, this camp takes a far more holistic attitude toward the most desirable means of combating Naxal violence.13 Stressing the need for poverty reduction, land reform, and better local governance, adherents to this line of reasoning reject government sponsored violence as a solution to the Naxalite problem except in the most extreme circumstances.14 As P. V. Ramana puts it, “If the military option were effective, then the problem should not have resurfaced after the initial Naxalbari uprising was suppressed.”15 Indeed, this group views overly aggressive action on the part of security forces as one of the contributing causes of further radicalization in..."

Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.2 Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh.

In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it.

The stated goal of the Naxalites was, and remains to this day, to free the poor from the clutches of the landlords, to implement land reforms and destroy the oppressive feudal order in India. Although the nature of the movement makes it difficult to estimate the group’s size, recent estimates by The Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence service, have placed the numerical strength of the Naxalites at some 20,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. With regard to the latter, it is important to note that the Naxalite insurgency puts much effort into addressing the grievances of the marginalised poor, who are disappointed in – or even hostile towards – the Indian government. Although the group’s operatives occasionally lash out at the local population, Naxalite actions generally fit the ambition to create Naxalite-controlled areas to encircle the cities and eventually take over the country. While it is clear that discrimination and poverty of the rural population provide the Naxalites with a support base and a pool of potential recruits, the government’s measures to alleviate the living conditions of the rural poor are generally half-hearted and poorly implemented.

The Naxal insurgency in India originated in a 1967 uprising in West Bengal by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Most of the modern Maoist groups evolved from splinter groups of CPI- Marxist. Two of those splinter groups united in 2004 to form CPI-Maoist, the primary force in today’s conflict. The conflict is concentrated the Eastern part of the country, particularly an area known as the Red Corridor. As of 2017, 104 districts in 13 states are affected by Naxal violence, down from a 2009 high of 195 districts in 16 states. Under India’s Constitution, maintenance of public order is the responsibility of States. The affected States have approached the insurgency with a mixture of policies including negotiation, development programs, and security programs."

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) India will likely launch limited military strikes against Pakistan in the coming days in retaliation for the deadly April 22 attack in Kashmir, increasing the risk of escalation despite both sides' desire to avoid a full-scale war and international pressure to de-escalate. On April 28, India and Pakistan entered their fifth consecutive day of cross-border gunfire, following India's accusations that Pakistan was involved in the April 22 militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 civilians and injured 17 others. The Resistance Front -- a militant group India accuses of being a front for the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba -- initially claimed responsibility for the attack, which it says was in opposition to India sending more than 85,000 \"outsiders\" to Kashmir to promote \"demographic change.\" The Resistance Front, which formed in the wake of India's contentious 2019 revocation of Kashmir's autonomy, has claimed sporadic attacks on non-locals in the region...

Lynch III**, _Center for Strategic Research, Institute for National Strategic Studies, National Defense University_ Files Description The pace of U.S.-India defense cooperation over the past decade—and especially the past 2 years—has been unprecedented and impressive in many areas. These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive.

They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was assaulted and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed Hindutva, the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,”..."

[] Tensions are rising among India, Pakistan and China amid rumors of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops entering Kashmir through Gilgit-Baltistan region. Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. Article Search * * * !

To receive the bailout funds, the States will be required to privatise their electric utilities and transfer managerial control or keep control but list them on a stock exchange, according to three government officials and a document outlining the plan prepared by the Ministry of Power. The Power Ministry and the Ministry of Finance are discussing the final details of the bailout, with an announcement expected in the February budget, said two of the government sources. Under the proposal, at least 20% of the State’s total power consumption must be met by private companies and the states must assume part of the retailer’s debt, according to the Power Ministry presentation. First, the States can create a new distribution company, divest 51% of the equity, which will enable them to access a 50-year interest-free loan for the privatised company’s debt, along with access to low-interest Central loans for five years, the presentation showed. The second option would let states..."

India is switching to smart grids for a number of reasons, but one of the most important is to deal with the growing amount of renewable energy, largely solar and wind, that is being used more and more at the distribution level.

This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry...

Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies.

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected....

As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come..."

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now Subscribe Already have an account? Sign In"

Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. **The information contained in this communication is not a research recommendation or ‘investment research’ and is classified as a ‘Marketing Communication’ in accordance with the applicable regional regulation.

[] (Stratfor) The White House announced May 31 that it had revoked India's tariff benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance..."
