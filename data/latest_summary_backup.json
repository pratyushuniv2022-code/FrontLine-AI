While both the LOC and LAC are critical to India’s security calculus, the LOC, given its history of cross-border terrorism and regular skirmishes, remains the more immediate and volatile flashpoint-especially in the context of operations like Sindoor. advertisement UNDRSTANDING THE LOC AND LAC: **LINE OF CONTROL (LOC):** - The LOC is a 740–776 km long military control line dividing Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. - Unlike the LOC, the LAC is not mutually agreed upon, mapped, or demarcated on the ground, leading to overlapping claims and frequent patrol face-offs.

    "summary": "_China’s narrative and material backing of Pakistan throughout the current Kashmir crisis is worrying India’s overstretched military._ India and Pakistan are embroiled in hostilities in the aftermath of a terror attack on civilians in Pahalgam, Kashmir on April 22. This is because an India that is concerned about dealing with the security threat from Pakistan, or one that is diverting resources and capital to its Western border, is an India that is distracted from the Chinese threat. This threat is not only on the northern and eastern borders but also in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), restricting India’s focus to its continental theater and away from a naval one. These range from seeking an “ impartial investigation” to recounting India’s defeat in the 1962 war to amplifying Islamabad’s claims of low-lying flooding due to India’s manipulation of the Indus River’s waters. The latter claim is especially unsubstantiated, given that even if there are higher levels of water recorded in Jhelum in the past few days, it is likely a result of the seasonal melting of glaciers—something the Lahore Flood Forecasting Division itself warned residents of, on April 18. This means that if the conflict with Pakistan drags on, there will be a need to service and secure weapons systems and defense components that can match the strength of Chinese-made Pakistani equipment while also ensuring that both the LAC and the LoC have enough strength to deal with incursions and skirmishes on the ground. It must make the case that India..."

On Nov. 11, a suicide bombing killed at least 12 people and injured 36 outside the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. While the Afghanistan-based Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group denied responsibility, a hard-line TTP faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), subsequently claimed the attack and said it targeted \"the judges, lawyers, and other staff who enforce Pakistan's un-Islamic laws.\" Pakistani authorities are still investigating \"all aspects\" of the bombing, though some top officials have suggested it occurred with Indian support, with Pakistan's prime minister attributing the attack to India-backed militants, and the country's interior minister claiming \"Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" were...

[] Renewed altercations between Chinese and Indian forces in the disputed region of Ladakh reflect a growing risk of military escalation as China's growing presence along the two countries' border prompts India to more assertively defend its claimed territory. China and India have accused each other of firing shots during a Sept. 7 incident south of Pangong Lake, marking the first official claims of small arms fire on the border since 1975. While the situation in Ladakh had calmed down after the deadly June 15 melee in Galwan Valley, a resurgence of tensions is now occurring in a separate area of the disputed territory. Since Aug. 29, Chinese forces have allegedly been trying to cross into Indian controlled territory in the mountainous area between Pangong and Spanggur Lakes. India reportedly deployed troops to block these Chinese incursion attempts in several separate incidents. [Worldview- News at demand] Keep Reading Register to..."

He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background.

India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies.
