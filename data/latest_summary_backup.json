    "summary": "**A Triangle Made in History** The India-Pakistan-China triangle is mired in a convoluted history of unresolved border disputes, with military confrontations between India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and India and Pakistan at the Line of Control (LoC) occurring intermittently. **The Triangle in Contemporary Times** What characterizes this triangle is the geographical proximity of the three nuclear-armed countries, wherein any military standoff or confrontation is perceived as having the risk of use of nuclear weapons, or the probability of a two-front war for India, against a Sino-Pakistani combined military assault. However, the Pakistani response to any India-China border confrontation, and a Chinese response to an India-Pakistan war or a military standoff at the borders, is **more tacit than overt**, since the China-Pakistan strategic alliance does not have any unambiguous notion of the two countries coming to each other’s help in the event of a war. The interlocking threat perceptions and responses in the triangle hence cannot be decoupled from the U.S. strategy in the region, making the strategic chain an effective complement to explain the geopolitics of Southern Asia. Infrastructure building in the border areas and the issue of terrain advantage has been a **major source of contention**, particularly, as seen in the current clashes between Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh, or in the earlier Doklam standoff. This should include talking to the Taliban, to secure its interest in Afghanistan, in the event of an American withdrawal, the return of the Taliban as a..."

In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash..."

When first identified by US government partners back in mid-2023, the campaign by the Salt Typhoon group was assessed as a targeted espionage effort against US and allied government systems. The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has publicly attributed the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge. Beyond the sheer number of cyber incidents, patterns in their objectives distinguish cyber operations in the Indo-Pacific from those in other regions.

It added that engineering crews were working “around the clock” to repair the network despite dangerous conditions on the ground.

The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about. However, the announcement came just hours after cross-border attacks had sharply escalated, with India reportedly striking several Pakistani airbases, including one near Islamabad, to which Pakistan responded by reportedly hitting two..."

In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how.

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy..."

(YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images) In early fall, we examined the implications of increasing energy prices, including their potential to generate social unrest. Since then, many countries have witnessed more generalized inflation -- which is causing prices to rise for a variety of essentials, not just the energy that consumers pay to heat their homes, cook their food and drive their cars -- suggesting that unrest risks are expanding as more countries and more items are affected. As concerns grow that inflationary pressures will persist long into 2022 it is worth examining what countries may be most vulnerable to inflation-driven unrest and how it could play out. To do so, looking back at previous episodes of unrest linked to price rises can help evaluate what could happen in the coming year....

India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies.

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing..."

The project was developed by the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and integrates a mix of artificial intelligence, anomaly detection, on-board inspection, autonomous decision-making, and even “intelligent deception” designed to mislead potential attackers. “By embedding censorship, surveillance logic, and active defense techniques directly into space infrastructure, China is shaping the rules of the satellite internet race in ways that challenge open-network models such as Starlink,” the group said. The “Satellite Internet Firewall” was independently developed by the National Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications at BUPT, under the leadership of Professors Zhao Yongli and Zhang Jie, and guided by Academician Guo Shize. Beiyou News said the project marked “a historic step forward” for China in satellite internet security, describing it as the world’s first multi-dimensional integrated security payload capable of protecting both the physical and network layers of satellite internet systems.

New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance..."
