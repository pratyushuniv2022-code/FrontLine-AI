The Naxal insurgency in India originated in a 1967 uprising in West Bengal by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Most of the modern Maoist groups evolved from splinter groups of CPI- Marxist. Two of those splinter groups united in 2004 to form CPI-Maoist, the primary force in today’s conflict. The conflict is concentrated the Eastern part of the country, particularly an area known as the Red Corridor. As of 2017, 104 districts in 13 states are affected by Naxal violence, down from a 2009 high of 195 districts in 16 states. Under India’s Constitution, maintenance of public order is the responsibility of States. The affected States have approached the insurgency with a mixture of policies including negotiation, development programs, and security programs."

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of domestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime security activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence-sharing and operations.

They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was assaulted and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed Hindutva, the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the..."

[] Tensions are rising among India, Pakistan and China amid rumors of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops entering Kashmir through Gilgit-Baltistan region. Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. Article Search * * * !

India has faced an onslaught of both floods and droughts in recent years. (TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future.

(YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images) In early fall, we examined the implications of increasing energy prices, including their potential to generate social unrest. Since then, many countries have witnessed more generalized inflation -- which is causing prices to rise for a variety of essentials, not just the energy that consumers pay to heat their homes, cook their food and drive their cars -- suggesting that unrest risks are expanding as more countries and more items are affected. As concerns grow that inflationary pressures will persist long into 2022 it is worth examining what countries may be most vulnerable to inflation-driven unrest and how it could play out. To do so, looking back at previous episodes of unrest linked to price rises can help evaluate what could happen in the coming year....

While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances. This announcement came as all three countries are engaged in International Monetary Fund programs and face economic challenges, including high debt burdens and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. ..."

    "summary": "Indian toy exporters, who saw a strong start this financial year due to early festival shipments and advance buying by US customers, are now facing a sharp drop in new orders. The 50 per cent tariff imposed by the US has pushed many American buyers to explore other sourcing markets, forcing Indian exporters to cut prices and simplify packaging to stay competitive, according to a report by The Economic Times. Amitabh Kharbanda, a governing body member of the Toy Association of India, said orders that usually arrive between October and November are down by around half this year, as reported by The Economic Times. Exports still up in early FY25, but challenges grow Despite the slowdown emerging in the second half of the year, shipments in the first five months showed moderate growth. Exports of festive and entertainment articles rose 4 per cent year-on-year to $101.9 million, while total exports of toys, games and sports goods increased 8.9 per cent to $302.6 million in April-August, the news report said. The US first levied a 25 per cent duty on Indian toy imports from August 1 and later raised it to 50 per cent from August 27, linking the decision to India’s procurement of Russian crude. The news report quoted him as saying that the buyers had placed orders earlier than usual due to high tariffs on Chinese toys. Early buying strengthened volumes in the first half, but once the higher tariff on Indian toys came in, fresh orders slowed, he..."

    "summary": "The country exported $5 billion worth of frozen shrimp in the financial year ending in March 2025, with nearly half of this trade directed towards the US market. The main commercial varieties produced in India include black tiger and Pacific whiteleg shrimp, with the latter dominating production, which reached 1.1 million tonnes in the financial year concluding March 2024. Typically, Indian shrimp farmers engage in two cultivation cycles of vannamei shrimp per year, from February to June and then from July to October. But the recent tariffs have resulted in a sharp decline in shrimp prices—from 300 rupees ($3.38) to 230 rupees ($2.59) per kilogram as farmers scramble to offload their harvests. Moreover, farmers often rely on imported brood stock from the US to breed and produce seeds for farming, yet reports indicate instances of poor-quality shipments ill-suited for Indian conditions, leading to additional disease risks. IPR Mohan Raju, president of the Prawn Farmers Federation of India, expressed a pressing need for the government to promote the breeding of shrimp using local stock to ensure high-quality, adaptive seeds. Experts like Sharma suggest that Indian exporters may need to pivot their focus away from international markets and explore the dormant potential of the domestic market—an area that has largely been overlooked in favor of export opportunities.

    "summary": "While the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is attempting to use global trade tensions to strengthen economic integration, the bloc's diversity will limit the extent of this effort even as, over time, common concern about export dependencies on the United States will drive ASEAN members to seek alternative trading partners. On May 26-27, Malaysia, as the 2025 ASEAN chair, hosted a series of summits that underscored ASEAN's broad dual-track initiatives to bolster intra-bloc trade and trade diversification. The 46th ASEAN Summit, convened on May 26, brought together leaders from the ten-member bloc and produced a new five-year strategic plan aimed at deepening economic integration among member states, with goals such as further harmonizing trade standards, enhancing financial integration and promoting sustainable economic practices. Leaders also committed to finalizing an upgraded ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement by October, which aims to further liberalize regional markets and boost intra-ASEAN trade beyond..."
