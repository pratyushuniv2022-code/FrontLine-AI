Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.2 Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh.

The stated goal of the Naxalites was, and remains to this day, to free the poor from the clutches of the landlords, to implement land reforms and destroy the oppressive feudal order in India. Although the nature of the movement makes it difficult to estimate the group’s size, recent estimates by The Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence service, have placed the numerical strength of the Naxalites at some 20,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. With regard to the latter, it is important to note that the Naxalite insurgency puts much effort into addressing the grievances of the marginalised poor, who are disappointed in – or even hostile towards – the Indian government. Although the group’s operatives occasionally lash out at the local population, Naxalite actions generally fit the ambition to create Naxalite-controlled areas to encircle the cities and eventually take over the country. While it is clear that discrimination and poverty of the rural population provide the Naxalites with a support base and a pool of potential recruits, the government’s measures to alleviate the living conditions of the rural poor are generally half-hearted and poorly implemented.

The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies.

Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals.

Lynch III**, _Center for Strategic Research, Institute for National Strategic Studies, National Defense University_ Files Description The pace of U.S.-India defense cooperation over the past decade—and especially the past 2 years—has been unprecedented and impressive in many areas. These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive.

Late on May 12, India and Pakistan's directors general of military operations spoke by phone, days after India and Pakistan on May 10 agreed to a ceasefire after coming close to full-blown conflict. The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about. However, the announcement came just hours after cross-border attacks had sharply escalated, with India reportedly striking several Pakistani airbases, including one near Islamabad, to which Pakistan responded by reportedly hitting two..."

They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was assaulted and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed Hindutva, the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,”..."

[] Tensions are rising among India, Pakistan and China amid rumors of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops entering Kashmir through Gilgit-Baltistan region. Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. Article Search * * * !

Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims.

For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs.

The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan.

Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints.

On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected....

The Indian government had worked to position the country as a viable alternative to China under the China+1 strategy, especially in smartphone manufacturing. A crucial step would be to fast-track the ongoing negotiations for a Bilateral Trade Agreement with the US. In March, New Delhi signed the terms of reference for a BTA following a push from the Prime Minister’s Office. Xi emphasised the need for mutual modernisation between China and India as leading voices of the Global South — perhaps suggesting a pivot away from overreliance on Western markets. **The road ahead** The 26% reciprocal tariff may compel India to re-examine its own tariff structures, not just in response to the US, but to remain competitive in global markets."

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations.
