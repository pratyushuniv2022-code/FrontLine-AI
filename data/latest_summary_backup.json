In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]] The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police..."

Advertisment On April 28, 2025, the Spanish and Portuguese electricity grids collapsed, causing a total voltage outage and disconnecting the region from the continental European grid. **The Incident** At the time, Spain and Portugal were experiencing low demand alongside very high renewable penetration—82% in Spain and 91% in Portugal. According to Powergrid’s report, around 7,400 MW of gas and 3,000 MW of nuclear capacity went offline, taking the total outage to 12,800 MW. Advertisment **Factors Behind Grid Instability** Minutes of a meeting chaired by the Secretary (Power) on August 27, 2025, revealed that insufficient reactive power and voltage control, poor damping of oscillations, and cascade tripping due to overvoltage were the root causes of the blackout. Reactive power support refers to the management and provision of reactive power to ensure the grid operates reliably and efficiently. This is typically achieved using devices like: - **Capacitor banks** – to supply reactive power - **Synchronous condensers** – to generate or absorb reactive power - **Static VAR..."

The outage left the Caribbean island struggling to electrify even essential services, though backup systems maintained operations at key facilities like hospitals and airports. This latest grid failure marks the fourth in a year, with widespread blackouts becoming a common experience for the island's 9.7 million inhabitants. Government officials in Havana are actively working to revive major power plants to alleviate the ongoing energy crisis that has long plagued the nation. The collapse exacerbates existing economic difficulties characterized by fuel and food shortages, thrusting residents into further hardship. Many, like Raúl Ernesto Gutierrez and Danai Hernandez, express frustration and stress as they revert to traditional means for daily activities. - READ MORE ON: - Cuba - power outage - electricity crisis - blackouts - national grid - economic crisis - energy infrastructure - Havana - oil imports - essential services..."

The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has publicly attributed the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. Article Search * * * !

On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry...

The organization's fighters regularly sustain casualties, but Wani's death set off widespread protests in the state's capital, Srinagar.

Since then, many countries have witnessed more generalized inflation -- which is causing prices to rise for a variety of essentials, not just the energy that consumers pay to heat their homes, cook their food and drive their cars -- suggesting that unrest risks are expanding as more countries and more items are affected. As concerns grow that inflationary pressures will persist long into 2022 it is worth examining what countries may be most vulnerable to inflation-driven unrest and how it could play out. To do so, looking back at previous episodes of unrest linked to price rises can help evaluate what could happen in the coming year....

    "summary": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India..."

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected....

The 46th ASEAN Summit, convened on May 26, brought together leaders from the ten-member bloc and produced a new five-year strategic plan aimed at deepening economic integration among member states, with goals such as further harmonizing trade standards, enhancing financial integration and promoting sustainable economic practices. Leaders also committed to finalizing an upgraded ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement by October, which aims to further liberalize regional markets and boost intra-ASEAN trade beyond..."

While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances.

[] (Stratfor) On Sept. 24, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, raising expectations that the two sides were poised to reveal a new trade deal following months of talks. But according to information leaked from the meeting, the negotiators failed to agree on Indian concessions on information and communication technology, dairy, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, e-commerce, and data localization -- in short, every bone of contention that has stymied an agreement for months. Still, U.S. President Donald Trump told visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi the same day that they would be able to announce a trade deal soon. ...
